Drug-induced hepatotoxicity\nA 46-year-old male on warfarin for recurrent deep venous thromboses has an increase in INR from 2.5 to 4.0 after starting new medications advised by his primary care physician. Given this change, which specific medication is most likely responsible for increasing his INR?\nAn 85-year-old woman is brought to her primary care provider by her son for a checkup. She is feeling well with no major complaints. Her son is concerned that she has been bruising much more easily over the last week or two. Past medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a urinary tract infection that was successfully treated with an extended course of oral cephalexin 3 weeks ago. Family history is noncontributory. Today, her heart rate is 90/min, respiratory rate is 17/min, blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg, and temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.1\u00b0F). On physical exam, her heart has a regular rate and rhythm and her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. She has some poorly demarcated purple-yellow bruising and areas of dark purple bruising as well. Further analysis reveals a prolonged PT that corrects with mixing, normal liver function tests, and a stool test that is guaiac positive.
