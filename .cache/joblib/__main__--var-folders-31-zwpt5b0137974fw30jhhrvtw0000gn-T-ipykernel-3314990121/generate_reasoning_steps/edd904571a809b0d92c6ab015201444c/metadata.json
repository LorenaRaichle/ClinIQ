To diagnose chILD, doctors may first need to rule out other diseases as the cause of a child's symptoms.\\n                \\nEarly diagnosis of chILD may help doctors stop or even reverse lung function problems. Often though, doctors find chILD hard to diagnose because:\\n                \\nThere are many types of the disease and a range of underlying causes\\n                \\nThe disease's signs and symptoms are the same as those for many other diseases\\n                \\nThe disease may coexist with other diseases\\n                \\nGoing to a pediatric pulmonologist who has experience with chILD is helpful. A pediatric pulmonologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating children who have lung diseases and conditions.\\n                \\nMedical and Family Histories\\n                \\nYour child's medical history can help his or her doctor diagnose chILD. The doctor may ask whether your child:\\n                \\nHas severe breathing problems that occur often.\\n                \\nHas had severe lung infections.\\n                \\nHad serious lung problems as a newborn.\\n                \\nHas been exposed to possible lung irritants in the environment, such as birds, molds, dusts, or chemicals.\\n                \\nHas ever had radiation or chemotherapy treatment.\\n                \\nHas an autoimmune disease, certain birth defects, or other medical conditions. (Autoimmune diseases occur if the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the bodys tissues and cells.)\\n                \\nThe doctor also may ask how old your child was when symptoms began, and whether other family members have or have had severe lung diseases. If they have, your child may have an inherited form of chILD.\\n                \\nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\\n                \\nNo single test can diagnose the many types of chILD. Thus, your child's doctor may recommend one or more of the following tests. For some of these tests, infants and young children may be given medicine to help them relax or sleep.\\n                \\nA chest x ray. This painless test creates pictures of the structures inside your child's chest, such as the heart, lungs, and blood vessels. A chest x ray can help rule out other lung diseases as the cause of your child's symptoms.\\n                \\nA high-resolution CT scan (HRCT). An HRCT scan uses x rays to create detailed pictures of your child's lungs. This test can show the location, extent, and severity of lung disease.\\n                \\nLung function tests. These tests measure how much air your child can breathe in and out, how fast he or she can breathe air out, and how well your child's lungs deliver oxygen to the blood. Lung function tests can assess the severity of lung disease. Infants and young children may need to have these tests at a center that has special equipment for children.\\n                \\nBronchoalveolar lavage (BRONG-ko-al-VE-o-lar lah-VAHZH). For this procedure, the doctor injects a small amount of saline (salt water) through a tube inserted in the child's lungs. The fluid helps bring up cells from the tissues around the air sacs. The doctor can then look at these cells under a microscope. This procedure can help detect an infection, lung injury, bleeding, aspiration, or an airway problem.\\n                \\nVarious tests to rule out conditions such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, acid reflux, heart disease, neuromuscular disease, and immune deficiency.\\n                \\nVarious tests for systemic diseases linked to chILD. Systemic diseases are diseases that involve many of the body's organs.\\n                \\nBlood tests to check for inherited (genetic) diseases and disorders.\\n                \\nIf these tests don't provide enough information, your child's doctor may recommend a lung biopsy. A lung biopsy is the most reliable way to diagnose chILD and the specific disease involved.\\n                \\nA lung biopsy is a surgical procedure that's done in a hospital. Before the biopsy, your child will receive medicine to make him or her sleep.\\n                \\nDuring the biopsy, the doctor will take small samples of lung tissue from several places in your child's lungs. This often is done using video-assisted thoracoscopy (thor-ah-KOS-ko-pe).\\n                \\nFor this procedure, the doctor inserts a small tube with a light and camera (endoscope) into your child's chest through small cuts between the ribs. The endoscope provides a video image of the lungs and allows the doctor to collect tissue samples.\\n                \\nAfter the biopsy, the doctor will look at these samples under a microscope.\", \"Childhood interstitial lung disease (chILD) is rare, and little research has been done on how to treat it. At this time, chILD has no cure. However, some children who have certain diseases, such as neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy, may slowly improve over time.\\n                \\nCurrent treatment approaches include supportive therapy, medicines, and, in the most serious cases, lung transplants.\\n                \\nSupportive Therapy\\n                \\nSupportive therapy refers to treatments that help relieve symptoms or improve quality of life. Supportive approaches used to relieve common chILD symptoms include:\\n                \\nOxygen therapy. If your child's blood oxygen level is low, he or she may need oxygen therapy. This treatment can improve breathing, support growth, and reduce strain on the heart.\\n                \\nBronchodilators. These medications relax the muscles around your childs airways, which helps open the airways and makes breathing easier.\\n                \\nBreathing devices. Children who have severe disease may need ventilators or other devices to help them breathe easier.\\n                \\nExtra nutrition. This treatment can help improve your child's growth and help him or her gain weight. Close monitoring of growth is especially important.\\n                \\nTechniques and devices to help relieve lung congestion. These may include chest physical therapy (CPT) or wearing a vest that helps move mucus (a sticky substance) to the upper airways so it can be coughed up. CPT may involve pounding the chest and back over and over with your hands or a device to loosen mucus in the lungs so that your child can cough it up.\\n                \\nSupervised pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems.\\n                \\nMedicines\\n                \\nCorticosteroids are a common treatment for many children who have chILD. These medicines help reduce lung inflammation.\\n                \\nOther medicines can help treat specific types or causes of chILD. For example, antimicrobial medicines can treat a lung infection. Acid-blocking medicines can prevent acid reflux, which can lead to aspiration.\\n                \\nLung Transplant\\n                \\nA lung transplant may be an option for children who have severe chILD if other treatments haven't worked.\\n                \\nCurrently, lung transplants are the only effective treatment for some types of chILD that have a high risk of death, such as alveolar capillary dysplasia and certain surfactant dysfunction mutations.\\n                \\nEarly diagnosis of these diseases gives children the chance to receive lung transplants. So far, chILD doesn't appear to come back in patients' transplanted lungs.\\n                \\nFor more information about this treatment, go to the Health Topics Lung Transplant article.\", \"At this time, most types of childhood interstitial lung disease (chILD) can't be prevented. People who have a family history of inherited (genetic) interstitial lung disease may want to consider genetic counseling. A counselor can explain the risk of children inheriting chILD.\\n                \\nYou and your child can take steps to help prevent infections and other illnesses that worsen chILD and its symptoms. For example:\\n                \\nMake hand washing a family habit to avoid germs and prevent illnesses.\\n                \\nTry to keep your child away from people who are sick. Even a common cold can cause problems for someone who has chILD.\\n                \\nTalk with your child's doctor about vaccines that your child needs, such as an annual flu shot. Make sure everyone in your household gets all of the vaccines that their doctors recommend.\\n                \\nTalk with your child's doctor about how to prevent your child from getting respiratory syncytial (sin-SIT-e-al) virus. This common virus leads to cold and flu symptoms for most people. However, it can make children who have lung diseases very sick.\\n                \\nAvoid exposing your child to air pollution, tobacco smoke, and other substances that can irritate his or her lungs. Strongly advise your child not to smoke now or in the future.\", \"Congenital (kon-JEN-ih-tal) heart defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. These defects can involve:\\n                \\nThe interior walls of the heart\\n                \\nThe valves inside the heart\\n                \\nThe arteries and veins that carry blood to the heart or the body\\n                \\nCongenital heart defects change the normal flow of blood through the heart.\\n                \\nThere are many types of congenital heart defects. They range from simple defects with no symptoms to complex defects with severe, life-threatening symptoms.\\n                \\nCongenital heart defects are the most common type of birth defect. They affect 8 out of every 1,000 newborns. Each year, more than 35,000 babies in the United States are born with congenital heart defects.\\n                \\nMany of these defects are simple conditions. They need no treatment or are easily fixed. Some babies are born with complex congenital heart defects. These defects require special medical care soon after birth.\\n                \\nThe diagnosis and treatment of complex heart defects has greatly improved over the past few decades. As a result, almost all children who have complex heart defects survive to adulthood and can live active, productive lives.\\n                \\nMost people who have complex heart defects continue to need special heart care throughout their lives. They may need to pay special attention to how their condition affects issues such as health insurance, employment, birth control and pregnancy, and other health issues.\\n                \\nIn the United States, more than 1 million adults are living with congenital heart defects.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283465.4931269}
