The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the deletion and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with chromosome 14q deletion include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems and distinctive facial features. Chromosome testing of both parents can provide more information on whether or not the deletion was inherited. In most cases, parents do not have any chromosomal anomaly. However, sometimes one parent is found to have a balanced translocation, where a piece of a chromosome has broken off and attached to another one with no gain or loss of genetic material. The balanced translocation normally does not cause any signs or symptoms, but it increases the risk for having an affected child with a chromosomal anomaly like a deletion. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. This page is meant to provide general information about 14q deletions. You can contact GARD if you have questions about a specific deletion on chromosome 14. To learn more about chromosomal anomalies please visit our GARD webpage on FAQs about Chromosome Disorders.', \"Primary familial brain calcification (PFBC) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by calcium deposits in the basal ganglia, a part of the brain that helps start and control movement. The first symptoms often include clumsiness, fatigue, unsteady walking (gait), slow or slurred speech, difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) and dementia. Migraines and seizures frequently occur. Symptoms typically start in an individual's 30's to 40's but may begin at any age.The neuropsychiatric symptoms and movement disorders worsen over time. Mutations in the SLC20A2, PDGFRB, and PDGFB genes have been found to cause PFBC. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.\", 'What are the signs and symptoms of Primary Familial Brain Calcification? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Primary Familial Brain Calcification. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of neuronal migration 90% Cerebral calcification 90% Hepatomegaly 90% Intrauterine growth retardation 90% Microcephaly 90% Seizures 90% Subcutaneous hemorrhage 90% Thrombocytopenia 90% Ventriculomegaly 90% Opacification of the corneal stroma 50% Abnormal pyramidal signs 5% Adult onset - Athetosis - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Basal ganglia calcification - Bradykinesia - Calcification of the small brain vessels - Chorea - Dense calcifications in the cerebellar dentate nucleus - Depression - Dysarthria - Dysdiadochokinesis - Dystonia - Gait disturbance - Hyperreflexia - Limb dysmetria - Mask-like facies - Memory impairment - Mental deterioration - Parkinsonism - Postural instability - Progressive - Psychosis - Rigidity - Tremor - Urinary incontinence - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What causes primary familial brain calcification (PFBC)? PFBC is a genetic condition. Mutations in the SLC20A2 gene are thought to cause about half of the cases of PFBC. Mutations in the PDGFRB and PDGFB genes have also been shown to cause PFBC. In some cases, the genes responsible have not yet been found.']}"}, "time": 1746283456.760801}
