You also may bleed inside your body (internally), especially in your knees, ankles, and elbows. This bleeding can damage your organs and tissues and may be life threatening.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nHemophilia usually is inherited. \"Inherited means that the disorder is passed from parents to children through genes.\\n                \\nPeople born with hemophilia have little or no clotting factor. Clotting factor is a protein needed for normal blood clotting. There are several types of clotting factors. These proteins work with platelets (PLATE-lets) to help the blood clot.\\n                \\nPlatelets are small blood cell fragments that form in the bone marrowa sponge-like tissue in the bones. Platelets play a major role in blood clotting. When blood vessels are injured, clotting factors help platelets stick together to plug cuts and breaks on the vessels and stop bleeding.\\n                \\nThe two main types of hemophilia are A and B. If you have hemophilia A, you\\'re missing or have low levels of clotting factor VIII (8). About 8 out of 10 people who have hemophilia have type A. If you have hemophilia B, you\\'re missing or have low levels of clotting factor IX (9).\\n                \\nRarely, hemophilia can be acquired. \"Acquired means you aren\\'t born with the disorder, but you develop it during your lifetime. This can happen if your body forms antibodies (proteins) that attack the clotting factors in your bloodstream. The antibodies can prevent the clotting factors from working.\\n                \\nThis article focuses on inherited hemophilia.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nHemophilia can be mild, moderate, or severe, depending on how much clotting factor is in your blood. About 7 out of 10 people who have hemophilia A have the severe form of the disorder.\\n                \\nPeople who don\\'t have hemophilia have a factor VIII activity of 100 percent. People who have severe hemophilia A have a factor VIII activity of less than 1 percent.\\n                \\nHemophilia usually occurs in males (with rare exceptions). About 1 in 5,000 males are born with hemophilia each year.', 'A defect in one of the genes that determines how the body makes blood clotting factor VIII or IX causes hemophilia. These genes are located on the X chromosomes (KRO-muh-somz).\\n                \\nChromosomes come in pairs. Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. Only the X chromosome carries the genes related to clotting factors.\\n                \\nA male who has a hemophilia gene on his X chromosome will have hemophilia. When a female has a hemophilia gene on only one of her X chromosomes, she is a \"hemophilia carrier and can pass the gene to her children. Sometimes carriers have low levels of clotting factor and have symptoms of hemophilia, including bleeding. Clotting factors are proteins in the blood that work together with platelets to stop or control bleeding.\\n                \\nVery rarely, a girl may be born with a very low clotting factor level and have a greater risk for bleeding, similar to boys who have hemophilia and very low levels of clotting factor. There are several hereditary and genetic causes of this much rarer form of hemophilia in females.\\n                \\nSome males who have the disorder are born to mothers who aren\\'t carriers. In these cases, a mutation (random change) occurs in the gene as it is passed to the child.\\n                \\nBelow are two examples of how the hemophilia gene is inherited.\\n                \\nInheritance Pattern for HemophiliaExample 1\\n                \\n\\n                \\nEach daughter has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the hemophilia gene from her mother and being a carrier. Each son has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the hemophilia gene from his mother and having hemophilia.\\n                \\nInheritance Pattern for HemophiliaExample 2\\n                \\n\\n                \\nEach daughter will inherit the hemophilia gene from her father and be a carrier. None of the sons will inherit the hemophilia gene from their father; thus, none will have hemophilia.', \"The major signs and symptoms of hemophilia are excessive bleeding and easy bruising.\\n                \\nExcessive Bleeding\\n                \\nThe extent of bleeding depends on how severe the hemophilia is.\\n                \\nChildren who have mild hemophilia may not have signs unless they have excessive bleeding from a dental procedure, an accident, or surgery. Males who have severe hemophilia may bleed heavily after circumcision.\\n                \\nBleeding can occur on the body's surface (external bleeding) or inside the body (internal bleeding).\\n                \\nSigns of external bleeding may include:\\n                \\nBleeding in the mouth from a cut or bite or from cutting or losing a tooth\\n                \\nNosebleeds for no obvious reason\\n                \\nHeavy bleeding from a minor cut\\n                \\nBleeding from a cut that resumes after stopping for a short time\\n                \\nSigns of internal bleeding may include:\\n                \\nBlood in the urine (from bleeding in the kidneys or bladder)\\n                \\nBlood in the stool (from bleeding in the intestines or stomach)\\n                \\nLarge bruises (from bleeding into the large muscles of the body)\\n                \\nBleeding in the Joints\\n                \\nBleeding in the knees, elbows, or other joints is another common form of internal bleeding in people who have hemophilia. This bleeding can occur without obvious injury.\\n                \\nAt first, the bleeding causes tightness in the joint with no real pain or any visible signs of bleeding. The joint then becomes swollen, hot to touch, and painful to bend.\\n                \\nSwelling continues as bleeding continues. Eventually, movement in the joint is temporarily lost. Pain can be severe. Joint bleeding that isn't treated quickly can damage the joint.\\n                \\nBleeding in the Brain\\n                \\nInternal bleeding in the brain is a very serious complication of hemophilia. It can happen after a simple bump on the head or a more serious injury. The signs and symptoms of bleeding in the brain include:\\n                \\nLong-lasting, painful headaches or neck pain or stiffness\\n                \\nRepeated vomiting\\n                \\nSleepiness or changes in behavior\\n                \\nSudden weakness or clumsiness of the arms or legs or problems walking\\n                \\nDouble vision\\n                \\nConvulsions or seizures\", 'If you or your child appears to have a bleeding problem, your doctor will ask about your personal and family medical histories. This will reveal whether you or your family members, including women and girls, have bleeding problems. However, some people who have hemophilia have no recent family history of the disease.\\n                \\nYou or your child also will likely have a physical exam and blood tests to diagnose hemophilia. Blood tests are used to find out:\\n                \\nHow long it takes for your blood to clot\\n                \\nWhether your blood has low levels of any clotting factors\\n                \\nWhether any clotting factors are completely missing from your blood\\n                \\nThe test results will show whether you have hemophilia, what type of hemophilia you have, and how severe it is.\\n                \\nHemophilia A and B are classified as mild, moderate, or severe, depending on the amount of clotting factor VIII or IX in the blood.\\n                \\nThe severity of symptoms can overlap between the categories. For example, some people who have mild hemophilia may have bleeding problems almost as often or as severe as some people who have moderate hemophilia.\\n                \\nSevere hemophilia can cause serious bleeding problems in babies. Thus, children who have severe hemophilia usually are diagnosed during the first year of life. People who have milder forms of hemophilia may not be diagnosed until they\\'re adults.\\n                \\nThe bleeding problems of hemophilia A and hemophilia B are the same. Only special blood tests can tell which type of the disorder you or your child has. Knowing which type is important because the treatments are different.\\n                \\nPregnant women who are known hemophilia carriers can have the disorder diagnosed in their unborn babies as early as 12 weeks into their pregnancies.\\n                \\nWomen who are hemophilia carriers also can have \"preimplantation diagnosis\" to have children who don\\'t have hemophilia.\\n                \\nFor this process, women have their eggs removed and fertilized by sperm in a laboratory. The embryos are then tested for hemophilia. Only embryos without the disorder are implanted in the womb.']}"}, "time": 1746283466.180845}
