Certain irritants and allergens, medical conditions, and medicines can irritate these nerve endings.\\n                \\nIrritants and Allergens\\n                \\nAn irritant is something you\\'re sensitive to. For example, smoking or inhaling secondhand smoke can irritate your lungs. Smoking also can lead to medical conditions that can cause a cough. Other irritants include air pollution, paint fumes, or scented products like perfumes or air fresheners.\\n                \\nAn allergen is something you\\'re allergic to, such as dust, animal dander, mold, or pollens from trees, grasses, and flowers.\\n                \\nCoughing helps clear your airways of irritants and allergens. This helps prevent infections.\\n                \\nMedical Conditions\\n                \\nMany medical conditions can cause acute, subacute, or chronic cough.\\n                \\nCommon causes of an acute cough are a common cold or other upper respiratory infections. Examples of other upper respiratory infections include the flu, pneumonia, and whooping cough. An acute cough lasts less than 3 weeks.\\n                \\nA lingering cough that remains after a cold or other respiratory infection is gone often is called a subacute cough. A subacute cough lasts 3 to 8 weeks.\\n                \\nCommon causes of a chronic cough are upper airway cough syndrome (UACS), asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). A chronic cough lasts more than 8 weeks.\\n                \\n\"UACS\" is a term used to describe conditions that inflame the upper airways and cause a cough. Examples include sinus infections and allergies. These conditions can cause mucus (a slimy substance) to run down your throat from the back of your nose. This is called postnasal drip.\\n                \\nAsthma is a long-term lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways. GERD is a condition in which acid from your stomach backs up into your throat.\\n                \\nOther conditions that can cause a chronic cough include:\\n                \\nRespiratory infections. A cough from an upper respiratory infection can develop into a chronic cough.\\n                \\nChronic bronchitis (bron-KI-tis). This condition occurs if the lining of the airways is constantly irritated and inflamed. Smoking is the main cause of chronic bronchitis.\\n                \\nBronchiectasis (brong-ke-EK-tah-sis). This is a condition in which damage to the airways causes them to widen and become flabby and scarred. This prevents the airways from properly moving mucus out of your lungs. An infection or other condition that injures the walls of the airways usually causes bronchiectasis.\\n                \\nCOPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). COPD is a disease that prevents enough air from flowing in and out of the airways.\\n                \\nLung cancer. In rare cases, a chronic cough is due to lung cancer. Most people who develop lung cancer smoke or used to smoke.\\n                \\nHeart failure. Heart failure is a condition in which the heart can\\'t pump enough blood to meet the body\\'s needs. Fluid can build up in the body and lead to many symptoms. If fluid builds up in the lungs, it can cause a chronic cough.\\n                \\nMedicines\\n                \\nCertain medicines can cause a chronic cough. Examples of these medicines are ACE inhibitors and beta blockers. ACE inhibitors are used to treat high blood pressure (HBP). Beta blockers are used to treat HBP, migraine headaches, and glaucoma.', 'People at risk for cough include those who:\\n                \\nAre exposed to things that irritate their airways (called irritants) or things that they\\'re allergic to (called allergens). Examples of irritants are cigarette smoke, air pollution, paint fumes, and scented products. Examples of allergens are dust, animal dander, mold, and pollens from trees, grasses, and flowers.\\n                \\nHave certain conditions that irritate the lungs, such as asthma, sinus infections, colds, or gastroesophageal reflux disease.\\n                \\nSmoke. Smoking can irritate your lungs and cause coughing. Smoking and/or exposure to secondhand smoke also can lead to medical conditions that can cause a cough.\\n                \\nTake certain medicines, such as ACE inhibitors and beta blockers. ACE inhibitors are used to treat high blood pressure (HBP). Beta blockers are used to treat HBP, migraine headaches, and glaucoma.\\n                \\nWomen are more likely than men to develop a chronic cough. For more information about the substances and conditions that put you at risk for cough, go to \"What Causes Cough?\"', 'When you cough, mucus (a slimy substance) may come up. Coughing helps clear the mucus in your airways from a cold, bronchitis, or other condition. Rarely, people cough up blood. If this happens, you should call your doctor right away.\\n                \\nA cough may be a symptom of a medical condition. Thus, it may occur with other signs and symptoms of that condition. For example, if you have a cold, you may have a runny or stuffy nose. If you have gastroesophageal reflux disease, you may have a sour taste in your mouth.\\n                \\nA chronic cough can make you feel tired because you use a lot of energy to cough. It also can prevent you from sleeping well and interfere with work and socializing. A chronic cough also can cause headaches, chest pain, loss of bladder control, sweating, and, rarely, fractured ribs.', \"Your doctor will diagnose the cause of your cough based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results.\\n                \\nMedical History\\n                \\nYour doctor will likely ask questions about your cough. He or she may ask how long you've had it, whether you're coughing anything up (such as mucus, a slimy substance), and how much you cough.\\n                \\nYour doctor also may ask:\\n                \\nAbout your medical history, including whether you have allergies, asthma, or other medical conditions.\\n                \\nWhether you have heartburn or a sour taste in your mouth. These may be signs of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).\\n                \\nWhether you've recently had a cold or the flu.\\n                \\nWhether you smoke or spend time around others who smoke.\\n                \\nWhether you've been around air pollution, a lot of dust, or fumes.\\n                \\nPhysical Exam\\n                \\nTo check for signs of problems related to cough, your doctor will use a stethoscope to listen to your lungs. He or she will listen for wheezing (a whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe) or other abnormal sounds.\\n                \\nDiagnostic Tests\\n                \\nYour doctor may recommend tests based on the results of your medical history and physical exam. For example, if you have symptoms of GERD, your doctor may recommend a pH probe. This test measures the acid level of the fluid in your throat.\\n                \\nOther tests may include:\\n                \\nAn exam of the mucus from your nose or throat. This test can show whether you have a bacterial infection.\\n                \\nA chest x ray. A chest x ray takes a picture of your heart and lungs. This test can help diagnose conditions such as pneumonia and lung cancer.\\n                \\nLung function tests. These tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. Lung function tests can help diagnose asthma and other conditions.\\n                \\nAn x ray of the sinuses. This test can help diagnose a sinus infection.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283466.47716}
