Urine is normally sterile, and the normal flow of urine usually prevents bacteria from infecting the urinary tract. With urinary retention, the abnormal urine flow gives bacteria at the opening of the urethra a chance to infect the urinary tract.\\n                \\nBladder damage. If the bladder becomes stretched too far or for long periods, the muscles may be permanently damaged and lose their ability to contract.\\n                \\nKidney damage. In some people, urinary retention causes urine to flow backward into the kidneys. This backward flow, called reflux, may damage or scar the kidneys.\\n                \\nUrinary incontinence after prostate, tumor, or cancer surgery. Transurethral surgery to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia may result in urinary incontinence in some men. This problem is often temporary. Most men recover their bladder control in a few weeks or months after surgery. Surgery to remove tumors or cancerous tissue in the bladder, prostate, or urethra may also result in urinary incontinence.', 'People can prevent urinary retention before it occurs by treating some of the potential causes. For example, men with benign prostatic hyperplasia should take prostate medications as prescribed by their health care provider. Men with benign prostatic hyperplasia should avoid medications associated with urinary retention, such as over-the-counter cold and allergy medications that contain decongestants. Women with mild cystocele or rectocele may prevent urinary retention by doing exercises to strengthen the pelvic muscles. In most cases, dietary and lifestyle changes will help prevent urinary retention caused by constipation. People whose constipation continues should see a health care provider.\\n                \\nMore information about exercises to strengthen the pelvic muscles is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Kegel Exercise Tips.', 'Researchers have not found that eating, diet, and nutrition play a role in causing or preventing urinary retention.', '- Urinary retention is the inability to empty the bladder completely.  - Urinary retention can be acute or chronic.  - Urinary retention can result from      - obstruction of the urethra    - nerve problems    - medications    - weakened bladder muscles    - The symptoms of acute urinary retention may include the following and require immediate medical attention:      - inability to urinate    - painful, urgent need to urinate    - pain or discomfort in the lower abdomen    - bloating of the lower abdomen    - The symptoms of chronic urinary retention may include      - urinary frequencyurination eight or more times a day    - trouble beginning a urine stream    - a weak or an interrupted urine stream    - an urgent need to urinate with little success when trying to urinate    - feeling the need to urinate after finishing urination    - mild and constant discomfort in the lower abdomen and urinary tract    - A health care provider diagnoses acute or chronic urinary retention with      - a physical exam    - postvoid residual measurement    - A health care provider may use the following medical tests to help determine the cause of urinary retention:      - cystoscopy    - computerized tomography (CT) scans    - urodynamic tests    - electromyography    - A health care provider treats urinary retention with      - bladder drainage    - urethral dilation    - urethral stents    - prostate medications    - surgery    - Complications of urinary retention and its treatments may include      - urinary tract infections (UTIs)    - bladder damage    - kidney damage    - urinary incontinence after prostate, tumor, or cancer surgery    - People can prevent urinary retention before it occurs by treating some of the potential causes.']}"}, "time": 1746283484.6194618}
