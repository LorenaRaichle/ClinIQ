The tumor cells differ in type from that of the typical ductal or lobular breast cancers. The cells look like skin cells or cells that make bone. Some women experience no early signs or symptoms, while others experience general symptoms of breast cancers, such as new breast lumps. Treatment of metaplastic carcinoma of the breast is similar to that of invasive ductal cancer.', 'Desmoplastic infantile gangliomas (DIGs) are rare brain tumors that are normally located in the frontal or parietal lobes of the brain. They are usually diagnosed before 18 months of age with most infants presenting with a short duration of symptoms. Although seizures are not commonly observed, a bulging fontanelle, rapid head growth, vomiting, and a sunset sign are usually noted. The standard treatment for DIGs is surgical resection (surgical procedure in which the portion of the brain with the tumor is removed).', 'What signs and symptoms are associated with desmoplastic infantile gangliomas? Most infants with DIGs do not have seizures; however, they usually have a bulging fontanelle, rapid head growth, sunset sign, and vomiting.', 'How are desmoplastic infantile gangliomas diagnosed? In addition to detecting the signs and symptoms commonly seen in DIGs, head CT scans and MRIs may reveal the presence of this type of brain tumor.']}"}, "time": 1746283458.609896}
