It causes poor muscle tone, low levels of sex hormones and a constant feeling of hunger. The part of the brain that controls feelings of fullness or hunger does not work properly in people with PWS. They overeat, leading to obesity.    Babies with PWS are usually floppy, with poor muscle tone, and have trouble sucking. Boys may have undescended testicles. Later, other signs appear. These include       - Short stature    - Poor motor skills    - Weight gain     - Underdeveloped sex organs    - Mild intellectual and learning disabilities       There is no cure for PWS. Growth hormone, exercise, and dietary supervision can help build muscle mass and control weight. Other treatments may include sex hormones and behavior therapy. Most people with PWS will need specialized care and supervision throughout their lives.    NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'The appendix is a small, tube-like organ attached to the first part of the large intestine. It is located in the lower right part of the abdomen. It has no known function. A blockage inside of the appendix causes appendicitis. The blockage leads to increased pressure, problems with blood flow, and inflammation. If the blockage is not treated, the appendix can burst and spread infection into the abdomen. This causes a condition called peritonitis.    The main symptom is pain in the abdomen, often on the right side. It is usually sudden and gets worse over time. Other symptoms may include       -  Swelling in the abdomen    -  Loss of appetite    -  Nausea and vomiting    -  Constipation or diarrhea    -  Inability to pass gas    -  Low fever        Not everyone with appendicitis has all these symptoms.    Appendicitis is a medical emergency. Treatment almost always involves removing the appendix. Anyone can get appendicitis, but it is more common among people 10 to 30 years old.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Summary : Pets can add fun, companionship and a feeling of safety to your life. Before getting a pet, think carefully about which animal is best for your family. What is each family member looking for in a pet? Who will take care of it? Does anyone have pet allergies? What type of animal suits your lifestyle and budget?    Once you own a pet, keep it healthy. Know the signs of medical problems. Take your pet to the veterinarian if you notice:       - Loss of appetite    - Drinking a lot of water    - Gaining or losing a lot of weight quickly    - Strange behavior    - Being sluggish and tired    - Trouble getting up or down    - Strange lumps', 'The pelvic floor is a group of muscles and other tissues that form a sling or hammock across the pelvis. In women, it holds the uterus, bladder, bowel, and other pelvic organs in place so that they can work properly. The pelvic floor can become weak or be injured. The main causes are pregnancy and childbirth. Other causes include being overweight, radiation treatment, surgery, and getting older.    Common symptoms include       - Feeling heaviness, fullness, pulling, or aching in the vagina. It gets worse by the end of the day or during a bowel movement.    - Seeing or feeling a \"bulge\" or \"something coming out\" of the vagina    - Having a hard time starting to urinate or emptying the bladder completely    - Having frequent urinary tract infections    - Leaking urine when you cough, laugh, or exercise    - Feeling an urgent or frequent need to urinate    - Feeling pain while urinating    - Leaking stool or having a hard time controlling gas    - Being constipated    - Having a hard time making it to the bathroom in time       Your health care provider diagnoses the problem with a physical exam, a pelvic exam, or special tests. Treatments include special pelvic muscle exercises called Kegel exercises. A mechanical support device called a pessary helps some women. Surgery and medicines are other treatments.
