The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Dermoids of cornea. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Opacification of the corneal stroma 90% Visual impairment 90% Abnormality of the pupil 50% Abnormality of the eye - X-linked inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Desmoplastic small round cell tumors (DSRCT), a rare malignant cancer, is a soft tissue sarcoma that usually affects young boys and men and is found most often in the abdomen. Its name means that it is formed by small, round cancer cells surrounded by scarlike tissue. The most common symptoms include abdominal pain, abdominal mass and symptoms of gastrointestinal obstruction. DSRCTs are treated first with chemotherapy, then with surgery to remove the tumor, if possible. Radiation therapy is sometimes given, depending on the tumor. In addition, some people with DSRCT are candidates for a bone marrow transplant.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Mesomelic dysplasia Savarirayan type?

The disorder typically involves difficulties speaking and understanding spoken words. The symptoms cannot be attributed to sensorimotor, intellectual deficits, autism spectrum, or other developmental impairments. Likewise it does not occur as the consequence of an evident brain lesion or as a result of the child's social environment. Familial cases of developmental dyphasia have been described. In these families, the condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283457.630908}
