At least three families with this condition have been identified.', 'Mutations in the REN gene cause REN-related kidney disease. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called renin that is produced in the kidneys. Renin plays an important role in regulating blood pressure and water levels in the body.  Mutations in the REN gene that cause REN-related kidney disease result in the production of an abnormal protein that is toxic to the cells that normally produce renin. These kidney cells gradually die off, which causes progressive kidney disease.', 'This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.', 'These resources address the diagnosis or management of REN-related kidney disease:  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Autosomal Dominant Tubulointerstitial Kidney Disease, REN-Related (ADTKD-REN)  - Genetic Testing Registry: Hyperuricemic nephropathy, familial juvenile, 2  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Hyperkalemia  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Renin   These resources from MedlinePlus offer information about the diagnosis and management of various health conditions:  - Diagnostic Tests  - Drug Therapy  - Surgery and Rehabilitation  - Genetic Counseling   - Palliative Care']}"}, "time": 1746283450.864105}
