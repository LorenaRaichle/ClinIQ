Signs and symptoms also depend on whether the aneurysm has ruptured (burst) or is affecting other parts of the body.\\n                \\nAneurysms can develop and grow for years without causing any signs or symptoms. They often don't cause signs or symptoms until they rupture, grow large enough to press on nearby body parts, or block blood flow.\\n                \\nAbdominal Aortic Aneurysms\\n                \\nMost abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) develop slowly over years. They often don't cause signs or symptoms unless they rupture. If you have an AAA, your doctor may feel a throbbing mass while checking your abdomen.\\n                \\nWhen symptoms are present, they can include:\\n                \\nA throbbing feeling in the abdomen\\n                \\nDeep pain in your back or the side of your abdomen\\n                \\nSteady, gnawing pain in your abdomen that lasts for hours or days\\n                \\nIf an AAA ruptures, symptoms may include sudden, severe pain in your lower abdomen and back; nausea (feeling sick to your stomach) and vomiting; constipation and problems with urination; clammy, sweaty skin; light-headedness; and a rapid heart rate when standing up.\\n                \\nInternal bleeding from a ruptured AAA can send you into shock. Shock is a life-threatening condition in which blood pressure drops so low that the brain, kidneys, and other vital organs can't get enough blood to work well. Shock can be fatal if its not treated right away.\\n                \\nThoracic Aortic Aneurysms\\n                \\nA thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) may not cause symptoms until it dissects or grows large. If you have symptoms, they may include:\\n                \\nPain in your jaw, neck, back, or chest\\n                \\nCoughing and/or hoarseness\\n                \\nShortness of breath and/or trouble breathing or swallowing\\n                \\nA dissection is a split in one or more layers of the artery wall. The split causes bleeding into and along the layers of the artery wall.\\n                \\nIf a TAA ruptures or dissects, you may feel sudden, severe, sharp or stabbing pain starting in your upper back and moving down into your abdomen. You may have pain in your chest and arms, and you can quickly go into shock.\\n                \\nIf you have any symptoms of TAA or aortic dissection, call 911. If left untreated, these conditions may lead to organ damage or death.\", \"If you have an aortic aneurysm but no symptoms, your doctor may find it by chance during a routine physical exam. More often, doctors find aneurysms during tests done for other reasons, such as chest or abdominal pain.\\n                \\nIf you have an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), your doctor may feel a throbbing mass in your abdomen. A rapidly growing aneurysm about to rupture (burst) can be tender and very painful when pressed. If you're overweight or obese, it may be hard for your doctor to feel even a large AAA.\\n                \\nIf you have an AAA, your doctor may hear rushing blood flow instead of the normal whooshing sound when listening to your abdomen with a stethoscope.\\n                \\nSpecialists Involved\\n                \\nYour primary care doctor may refer you to a cardiothoracic or vascular surgeon for diagnosis and treatment of an aortic aneurysm.\\n                \\nA cardiothoracic surgeon does surgery on the heart, lungs, and other organs and structures in the chest, including the aorta. A vascular surgeon does surgery on the aorta and other blood vessels, except those of the heart and brain.\\n                \\nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\\n                \\nTo diagnose and study an aneurysm, your doctor may recommend one or more of the following tests.\\n                \\nUltrasound and Echocardiography\\n                \\nUltrasound and echocardiography (echo) are simple, painless tests that use sound waves to create pictures of the structures inside your body. These tests can show the size of an aortic aneurysm, if one is found.\\n                \\nComputed Tomography Scan\\n                \\nA computed tomography scan, or CT scan, is a painless test that uses x rays to take clear, detailed pictures of your organs.\\n                \\nDuring the test, your doctor will inject dye into a vein in your arm. The dye makes your arteries, including your aorta, visible on the CT scan pictures.\\n                \\nYour doctor may recommend this test if he or she thinks you have an AAA or a thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA). A CT scan can show the size and shape of an aneurysm. This test provides more detailed pictures than an ultrasound or echo.\\n                \\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging\\n                \\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses magnets and radio waves to create pictures of the organs and structures in your body. This test works well for detecting aneurysms and pinpointing their size and exact location.\\n                \\nAngiography\\n                \\nAngiography (an-jee-OG-ra-fee) is a test that uses dye and special x rays to show the insides of your arteries. This test shows the amount of damage and blockage in blood vessels.\\n                \\nAortic angiography shows the inside of your aorta. The test may show the location and size of an aortic aneurysm.\", \"Aortic aneurysms are treated with medicines and surgery. Small aneurysms that are found early and arent causing symptoms may not need treatment. Other aneurysms need to be treated.\\n                \\nThe goals of treatment may include:\\n                \\nPreventing the aneurysm from growing\\n                \\nPreventing or reversing damage to other body structures\\n                \\nPreventing or treating a rupture or dissection\\n                \\nAllowing you to continue doing your normal daily activities\\n                \\nTreatment for an aortic aneurysm is based on its size. Your doctor may recommend routine testing to make sure an aneurysm isn't getting bigger. This method usually is used for aneurysms that are smaller than 5 centimeters (about 2 inches) across.\\n                \\nHow often you need testing (for example, every few months or every year) is based on the size of the aneurysm and how fast it's growing. The larger it is and the faster it's growing, the more often you may need to be checked.\\n                \\nMedicines\\n                \\nIf you have an aortic aneurysm, your doctor may prescribe medicines before surgery or instead of surgery. Medicines are used to lower blood pressure, relax blood vessels, and lower the risk that the aneurysm will rupture (burst). Beta blockers and calcium channel blockers are the medicines most commonly used.\\n                \\nSurgery\\n                \\nYour doctor may recommend surgery if your aneurysm is growing quickly or is at risk of rupture or dissection.\\n                \\nThe two main types of surgery to repair aortic aneurysms are open abdominal or open chest repair and endovascular repair.\\n                \\nOpen Abdominal or Open Chest Repair\\n                \\nThe standard and most common type of surgery for aortic aneurysms is open abdominal or open chest repair. This surgery involves a major incision (cut) in the abdomen or chest.\\n                \\nGeneral anesthesia (AN-es-THE-ze-ah) is used during this procedure. The term anesthesia refers to a loss of feeling and awareness. General anesthesia temporarily puts you to sleep.\\n                \\nDuring the surgery, the aneurysm is removed. Then, the section of aorta is replaced with a graft made of material such as Dacron or Teflon. The surgery takes 3 to 6 hours; youll remain in the hospital for 5 to 8 days.\\n                \\nIf needed, repair of the aortic heart valve also may be done during open abdominal or open chest surgery.\\n                \\nIt often takes a month to recover from open abdominal or open chest surgery and return to full activity. Most patients make a full recovery.\\n                \\nEndovascular Repair\\n                \\nIn endovascular repair, the aneurysm isn't removed. Instead, a graft is inserted into the aorta to strengthen it. Surgeons do this type of surgery using catheters (tubes) inserted into the arteries; it doesn't require surgically opening the chest or abdomen. General anesthesia is used during this procedure.\\n                \\nThe surgeon first inserts a catheter into an artery in the groin (upper thigh) and threads it to the aneurysm. Then, using an x ray to see the artery, the surgeon threads the graft (also called a stent graft) into the aorta to the aneurysm.\\n                \\nThe graft is then expanded inside the aorta and fastened in place to form a stable channel for blood flow. The graft reinforces the weakened section of the aorta. This helps prevent the aneurysm from rupturing.\\n                \\nEndovascular Repair\\n                \\n\\n                \\nThe illustration shows the placement of a stent graft in an aortic aneurysm. In figure A, a catheter is inserted into an artery in the groin (upper thigh). The catheter is threaded to the abdominal aorta, and the stent graft is released from the catheter. In figure B, the stent graft allows blood to flow through the aneurysm.\\n                \\nThe recovery time for endovascular repair is less than the recovery time for open abdominal or open chest repair. However, doctors cant repair all aortic aneurysms with endovascular repair. The location or size of an aneurysm may prevent the use of a stent graft.\", 'The best way to prevent an aortic aneurysm is to avoid the factors that put you at higher risk for one. You cant control all aortic aneurysm risk factors, but lifestyle changes can help you lower some risks.\\n                \\nFor example, if you smoke, try to quit. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index (DCI) Smoking and Your Heart article.\\n                \\nAnother important lifestyle change is following a healthy diet. A healthy diet includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. It also includes lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, and fat-free or low-fat milk or milk products. A healthy diet is low in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium (salt), and added sugar.\\n                \\nFor more information about following a healthy diet, go to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBIs) Aim for a Healthy Weight Web site, \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart,\" and \"Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH.\" All of these resources include general information about healthy eating.\\n                \\nBe as physically active as you can. Talk with your doctor about the amounts and types of physical activity that are safe for you. For more information about physical activity, go to the DCI Physical Activity and Your Heart article and the NHLBIs \"Your Guide to Physical Activity and Your Heart.\"\\n                \\nWork with your doctor to control medical conditions such as high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol. Follow your treatment plans and take all of your medicines as your doctor prescribes.\\n                \\nScreening for Aneurysms\\n                \\nAlthough you may not be able to prevent an aneurysm, early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent rupture and dissection.\\n                \\nAneurysms can develop and grow large before causing any signs or symptoms. Thus, people who are at high risk for aneurysms may benefit from early, routine screening.\\n                \\nYour doctor may recommend routine screening if youre:\\n                \\nA man between the ages of 65 and 75 who has ever smoked\\n                \\nA man or woman between the ages of 65 and 75 who has a family history of aneurysms\\n                \\nIf youre at risk, but not in one of these high-risk groups, ask your doctor whether screening will benefit you.']}"}, "time": 1746283465.3874528}
