The management of individuals with factor V Leiden depends on the clinical circumstances. People with factor V Leiden who have had a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) are usually treated with blood thinners, or anticoagulants. Anticoagulants such as heparin and warfarin are given for varying amounts of time depending on the person's situation. It is not usually recommended that people with factor V Leiden be treated lifelong with anticoagulants if they have had only one DVT or PE, unless there are additional risk factors present. Having had a DVT or PE in the past increases a person's risk for developing another one in the future, but having factor V Leiden does not seem to add to the risk of having a second clot. In general, individuals who have factor V Leiden but have never had a blood clot are not routinely treated with an anticoagulant. Rather, these individuals are counseled about reducing or eliminating other factors that may add to one's risk of developing a clot in the future. In addition, these individuals may require temporary treatment with an anticoagulant during periods of particularly high risk, such as major surgery. Factor V Leiden increases the risk of developing a DVT during pregnancy by about seven-fold. Women with factor V Leiden who are planning pregnancy should discuss this with their obstetrician and/or hematologist. Most women with factor V Leiden have normal pregnancies and only require close follow-up during pregnancy. For those with a history of DVT or PE, treatment with an anticoagulant during a subsequent pregnancy can prevent recurrent problems.\", 'What are the signs and symptoms of Thoraco abdominal enteric duplication? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Thoraco abdominal enteric duplication. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal dermatoglyphics 90% Abnormality of the ribs 90% Abnormality of the tricuspid valve 90% Asymmetric growth 90% Camptodactyly of finger 90% Diastomatomyelia 90% Duodenal stenosis 90% Hepatomegaly 90% Intestinal malrotation 90% Meningocele 90% Respiratory insufficiency 90% Situs inversus totalis 90% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Cervical ribs, Sprengel anomaly, anal atresia, and urethral obstruction?

MMAS is very similar to systemic mastocytosis but without the itchy skin patches known as urticaria pigmentosa. Symptoms may be triggered by a number of factors, including eating, exertion, environmental conditions, emotional stress, or insect stings. It is caused by a very small change (mutation) in the KIT gene which results in a defect of the mast cells. Treatment may include antihistamines and other medications, as needed.']}"}, "time": 1746283455.940916}
