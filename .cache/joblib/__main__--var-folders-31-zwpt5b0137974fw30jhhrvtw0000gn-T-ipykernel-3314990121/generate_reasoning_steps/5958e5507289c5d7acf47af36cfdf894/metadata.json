Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, the more common type, your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood. You can also have prediabetes. This means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. Having prediabetes puts you at a higher risk of getting type 2 diabetes.    Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious problems. It can damage your eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Diabetes can also cause heart disease, stroke and even the need to remove a limb. Pregnant women can also get diabetes, called gestational diabetes.    Blood tests can show if you have diabetes. One type of test, the A1C, can also check on how you are managing your diabetes. Exercise, weight control and sticking to your meal plan can help control your diabetes. You should also monitor your blood glucose level and take medicine if prescribed.     NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Your immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to defend against germs. It helps your body to recognize these \"foreign\" invaders. Then its job is to keep them out, or if it can\\'t, to find and destroy them.    If your immune system cannot do its job, the results can be serious. Disorders of the immune system include       - Allergy and asthma - immune responses to substances that are usually not harmful    - Immune deficiency diseases - disorders in which the immune system is missing one or more of its parts    - Autoimmune diseases - diseases causing your immune system to attack your own body\\'s cells and tissues by mistake       NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases', 'Summary : Islets are cells found in clusters throughout the pancreas. They are made up of several types of cells. One of these is beta cells, which make insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the body use glucose for energy. Islet cell transplantation transfers cells from an organ donor into the body of another person. It is an experimental treatment for type 1 diabetes.    In type 1 diabetes, the beta cells of the pancreas no longer make insulin. A person who has type 1 diabetes must take insulin daily to live. Transplanted islet cells, however, can take over the work of the destroyed cells. The beta cells in these islets will begin to make and release insulin. Researchers hope islet transplantation will help people with type 1 diabetes live without daily insulin injections.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Tuberous sclerosis is a rare genetic disease that causes benign tumors to grow in the brain and other organs. Symptoms vary, depending on where the tumors grow. They could include       - Skin problems, such as light patches and thickened skin    - Seizures    - Behavior problems    - Intellectual disabilities    - Kidney problems       Some people have signs of tuberous sclerosis at birth. In others it can take time for the symptoms to develop. The disease can be mild, or it can cause severe disabilities. In rare cases, tumors in vital organs or other symptoms can be life-threatening.    Tuberous sclerosis has no cure, but treatments can help symptoms. Options include medicines, educational and occupational therapy, surgery, or surgery to treat specific complications.
