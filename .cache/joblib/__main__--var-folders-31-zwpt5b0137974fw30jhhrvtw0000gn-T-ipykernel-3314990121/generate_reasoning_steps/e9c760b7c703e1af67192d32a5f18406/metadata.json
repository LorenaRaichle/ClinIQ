These tests may look at:\\n                \\nHemoglobin and hematocrit. A low hemoglobin or hematocrit level suggests anemia, a complication of vasculitis. Vasculitis can interfere with the body's ability to make enough red blood cells. Vasculitis also can be linked to increased destruction of red blood cells.\\n                \\nAntineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA). These antibodies are present in people who have certain types of vasculitis.\\n                \\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). A high ESR may be a sign of inflammation in the body.\\n                \\nThe amount of C-reactive protein (CRP) in your blood. A high CRP level suggests inflammation.\\n                \\nBiopsy\\n                \\nA biopsy often is the best way for your doctor to make a firm diagnosis of vasculitis. During a biopsy, your doctor will take a small sample of your body tissue to study under a microscope. He or she will take the tissue sample from a blood vessel or an organ.\\n                \\nA pathologist will study the sample for signs of inflammation or tissue damage. A pathologist is a doctor who specializes in identifying diseases by studying cells and tissues under a microscope.\\n                \\nBlood Pressure\\n                \\nPeople who have vasculitis should have their blood pressure checked routinely. Vasculitis that damages the kidneys can cause high blood pressure.\\n                \\nUrinalysis\\n                \\nFor this test, you'll provide a urine sample for analysis. This test detects abnormal levels of protein or blood cells in the urine. Abnormal levels of these substances can be a sign of vasculitis affecting the kidneys.\\n                \\nEKG (Electrocardiogram)\\n                \\nAn EKG is a simple, painless test that records the heart's electrical activity. You might have this test to show whether vasculitis is affecting your heart.\\n                \\nEchocardiography\\n                \\nEchocardiography is a painless test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. The test gives information about the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves are working.\\n                \\nChest X Ray\\n                \\nA chest x ray is a painless test that creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. Abnormal chest x-ray results may show whether vasculitis is affecting your lungs or your large arteries (such as the aorta or the pulmonary arteries).\\n                \\nLung Function Tests\\n                \\nLung function tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood.\\n                \\nLung function tests can help your doctor find out whether airflow into and out of your lungs is restricted or blocked.\\n                \\nAbdominal Ultrasound\\n                \\nAn abdominal ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of the organs and structures in your abdomen. The picture may show whether vasculitis is affecting your abdominal organs.\\n                \\nComputed Tomography Scan\\n                \\nA computed tomography (to-MOG-rah-fee) scan, or CT scan, is a type of x ray that creates more detailed pictures of your internal organs than a standard x ray. The results from this test can show whether you have a type of vasculitis that affects your abdominal organs or blood vessels.\\n                \\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging\\n                \\nA magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test uses radio waves, magnets, and a computer to create detailed pictures of your internal organs.\\n                \\nOther Advanced Imaging Techniques\\n                \\nSeveral new imaging techniques are now being used to help diagnose vasculitis. Duplex ultrasonography combines an image of the structure of the blood vessel with a color image of the blood flow through that vein or artery. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) identifies areas that show higher glucose metabolism leading to problems in the blood vessels.\\n                \\nAngiography\\n                \\nAngiography (an-jee-OG-ra-fee) is a test that uses dye and special x rays to show blood flowing through your blood vessels.\\n                \\nThe dye is injected into your bloodstream. Special x-ray pictures are taken while the dye flows through your blood vessels. The dye helps highlight the vessels on the x-ray pictures.\\n                \\nDoctors use angiography to help find out whether blood vessels are narrowed, swollen, deformed, or blocked.\", \"Treatment for vasculitis will depend on the type of vasculitis you have, which organs are affected, and the severity of the condition.\\n                \\nPeople who have severe vasculitis are treated with prescription medicines. Rarely, surgery may be done. People who have mild vasculitis may find relief with over-the-counter pain medicines, such as acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen.\\n                \\nThe main goal of treating vasculitis is to reduce inflammation in the affected blood vessels. This usually is done by reducing or stopping the immune response that caused the inflammation.\\n                \\nTypes of Treatment\\n                \\nCommon prescription medicines used to treat vasculitis include corticosteroids and cytotoxic medicines.\\n                \\nCorticosteroids help reduce inflammation in your blood vessels. Examples of corticosteroids are prednisone, prednisolone, and methylprednisolone.\\n                \\nDoctors may prescribe cytotoxic medicines if vasculitis is severe or if corticosteroids don't work well. Cytotoxic medicines kill the cells that are causing the inflammation. Examples of these medicines are azathioprine, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide.\\n                \\nYour doctor may prescribe both corticosteroids and cytotoxic medicines.\\n                \\nOther treatments may be used for certain types of vasculitis. For example, the standard treatment for Kawasaki disease is high-dose aspirin and immune globulin. Immune globulin is a medicine thats injected into a vein.\\n                \\nCertain types of vasculitis may require surgery to remove aneurysms that have formed as a result of the condition. (An aneurysm is an abnormal bulge in the wall of a blood vessel.)\", 'You can\\'t prevent vasculitis. However, treatment can help prevent or delay the complications of vasculitis.\\n                \\nPeople who have severe vasculitis are treated with prescription medicines. Rarely, surgery may be done. People who have mild vasculitis may find relief with over-the-counter pain medicines, such as acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen.\\n                \\nFor more information about vasculitis treatments, go to \"How Is Vasculitis Treated?\"', 'Endocarditis (EN-do-kar-DI-tis) is an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves. This lining is called the endocardium (en-do-KAR-de-um). The condition also is called infective endocarditis (IE).\\n                \\nThe term \"endocarditis\" also is used to describe an inflammation of the endocardium due to other conditions. This article only discusses endocarditis related to infection.\\n                \\nIE occurs if bacteria, fungi, or other germs invade your bloodstream and attach to abnormal areas of your heart. The infection can damage your heart and cause serious and sometimes fatal complications.\\n                \\nIE can develop quickly or slowly; it depends on what type of germ is causing it and whether you have an underlying heart problem. When IE develops quickly, it\\'s called acute infective endocarditis. When it develops slowly, it\\'s called subacute infective endocarditis.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nIE mainly affects people who have:\\n                \\nDamaged or artificial (man-made) heart valves\\n                \\nCongenital heart defects (defects present at birth)\\n                \\nImplanted medical devices in the heart or blood vessels\\n                \\nPeople who have normal heart valves also can have IE. However, the condition is much more common in people who have abnormal hearts.\\n                \\nCertain factors make it easier for bacteria to enter your bloodstream. These factors put you at higher risk for IE. For example, poor dental hygiene and unhealthy teeth and gums increase your risk for the infection.\\n                \\nOther risk factors include using intravenous (IV) drugs, having a catheter (tube) or another medical device in your body for long periods, and having a history of IE.\\n                \\nCommon symptoms of IE are fever and other flu-like symptoms. Because the infection can affect people in different ways, the signs and symptoms vary. IE also can cause problems in many other parts of the body besides the heart.\\n                \\nIf you\\'re at high risk for IE, seek medical care if you have signs or symptoms of the infection, especially a fever that persists or unexplained fatigue (tiredness).\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nIE is treated with antibiotics for several weeks. You also may need heart surgery to repair or replace heart valves or remove infected heart tissue.\\n                \\nMost people who are treated with the proper antibiotics recover. But if the infection isn\\'t treated, or if it persists despite treatment (for example, if the bacteria are resistant to antibiotics), it\\'s usually fatal.\\n                \\nIf you have signs or symptoms of IE, see your doctor as soon as you can, especially if you have abnormal heart valves.']}"}, "time": 1746283466.035539}
