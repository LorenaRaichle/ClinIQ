The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Pulmonary arterial hypertension. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Pulmonary hypertension 100% Chest pain 90% Elevated right atrial pressure 90% Increased pulmonary vascular resistance 90% Respiratory insufficiency 90% Right ventricular failure 90% Right ventricular hypertrophy 90% Edema of the lower limbs 50% Hepatomegaly 50% Vertigo 50% Abnormal thrombosis 33% Dyspnea 33% Pulmonary arterial medial hypertrophy 33% Pulmonary artery vasoconstriction 33% Pulmonary aterial intimal fibrosis 33% Abnormality of the tricuspid valve 7.5% Acrocyanosis 7.5% Ascites 7.5% Congestive heart failure 7.5% Hemoptysis 7.5% Recurrent respiratory infections 7.5% Sudden cardiac death 7.5% Arterial intimal fibrosis - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Hypertension - Incomplete penetrance - Telangiectasia - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'How might pulmonary arterial hypertension be treated? People with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) benefit from receiving treatment at specialized centers. The Pulmonary Hypertension Association offers a Find a Doctor tool which may aid you in locating your nearest center. Treatment of serious or life threatening PAH may involve continuous IV epoprostenol. Other treatment options, include treprostinil, iloprost, bosentan, ambrisentan, sildenafil, and tadalafil. Many of these treatments can be administered in various forms, such as by shot, IV, or inhalation. A small number of people with PAH respond well to long term oral calcium channel blockers. Blood thinners, diuretics, and supplemental oxygen may be prescribed as needed. Many drugs can be harmful to people with PAH. The following should be avoided: appetite suppressants, cocaine, amphetamines (and related compounds), low oxygen environments (such as high altitudes), and possibly estrogen compounds (oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy).', 'Mycobacterium malmoense (M. malmoense) is a bacterium naturally found in the environment, such as in wet soil, house dust, water, dairy products, domestic and wild animals, food, and human waste. M. malmoense infections most often occur in adults with lung disease, and manifests as a lung infection. Skin and tissue infections with M. malmoense have also been described. In young children, M. Malmoense may cause an infection of lymphnodes in the neck (i.e., cervical lymphadenitis).', 'What are the signs and symptoms of mycobacterium malmoense infection? Many cases of M. malmoense infection cause no symptoms, and as a result go unrecognized. M. malmoense infections in adults often present as lung infections with or without fever. In children, M. malmoense infections can present as a single sided, non-tender, enlarging, neck mass. The mass may be violet in color and often does not respond to conventional antibiotic therapy. M. malmoense infection can also cause skin lesions or abscesses.']}"}, "time": 1746283461.242168}
