Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is a protein that protects the lungs. The liver makes it. If the AAT proteins aren't the right shape, they get stuck in the liver cells and can't reach the lungs.    Symptoms of AAT deficiency include       - Shortness of breath and wheezing    - Repeated lung infections    - Tiredness    - Rapid heartbeat upon standing    - Vision problems    - Weight loss       Some people have no symptoms and do not develop complications.    Blood tests and genetic tests can tell if you have it. If your lungs are affected, you may also have lung tests. Treatments include medicines, pulmonary rehab, and extra oxygen, if needed. Severe cases may need a lung transplant. Not smoking can prevent or delay lung symptoms.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\", 'Summary : Secondhand smoke is a mixture of the smoke that comes from the burning end of a cigarette, cigar, or pipe, and the smoke breathed out by the smoker. It contains more than 7,000 chemicals. Hundreds of those chemicals are toxic and about 70 can cause cancer.    Health effects of secondhand smoke include       - Ear infections in children    - More frequent and severe asthma attacks in children    - Heart disease and lung cancer in adults who have never smoked       There is no safe amount of secondhand smoke. Even low levels of it can be harmful. The only way to fully protect nonsmokers from secondhand smoke is not to allow smoking indoors.    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Sinusitis means your sinuses are inflamed. The cause can be an infection or another problem. Your sinuses are hollow air spaces within the bones surrounding the nose. They produce mucus, which drains into the nose. If your nose is swollen, this can block the sinuses and cause pain.    There are several types of sinusitis, including       - Acute, which lasts up to 4 weeks    - Subacute, which lasts 4 to 12 weeks    - Chronic, which lasts more than 12 weeks and can continue for months or even years    - Recurrent, with several attacks within a year       Acute sinusitis often starts as a cold, which then turns into a bacterial infection. Allergies, nasal problems, and certain diseases can also cause acute and chronic sinusitis.    Symptoms of sinusitis can include fever, weakness, fatigue, cough, and congestion. There may also be mucus drainage in the back of the throat, called postnasal drip. Your health care professional diagnoses sinusitis based on your symptoms and an examination of your nose and face. You may also need imaging tests. Treatments include antibiotics, decongestants, and pain relievers. Using heat pads on the inflamed area, saline nasal sprays, and vaporizers can also help.    NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases', \"Summary : It's important to recognize and treat mental illnesses in children early on. Once mental illness develops, it becomes a regular part of your child's behavior and is more difficult to treat.    But it's not always easy to know when your child has a serious problem. Everyday stresses can cause changes in your child's behavior. For example, getting a new brother or sister or going to a new school may cause a child to temporarily act out. Warning signs that it might be a more serious problem include       - Problems in more than one setting (at school, at home, with peers)    - Changes in appetite or sleep    - Social withdrawal or fear of things he or she did not used to be not afraid of    - Returning to behaviors more common in younger children, such as bedwetting    - Signs of being upset, such as sadness or tearfulness    - Signs of self-destructive behavior, such as head-banging or suddenly getting hurt often    - Repeated thoughts of death       To diagnose mental health problems, the doctor or mental health specialist looks at your child's signs and symptoms, medical history, and family history. Treatments include medicines and talk therapy.    NIH: National Institute of Mental Health\"]}"}, "time": 1746283467.6050649}
