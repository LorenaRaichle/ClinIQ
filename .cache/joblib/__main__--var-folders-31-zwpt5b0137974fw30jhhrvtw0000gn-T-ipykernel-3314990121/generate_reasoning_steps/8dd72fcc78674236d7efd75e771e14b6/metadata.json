The diagnosis of Imerslund-Grasbeck syndrome (IGS) is made after a series of tests are performed. Cobalamin deficiency is typically detected first, followed by showing that cobalamin is poorly absorbed (the main cause of cobalamin deficiency). Other known causes of vitamin B12 malabsorption must then be ruled out. Lastly, it must be shown that after correcting the deficiency, the only nutrient to be poorly absorbed is vitamin B12. The diagnosis can also be confirmed by having genetic testing of the genes that are known to cause the condition. While the presence of proteinuria is strongly suggestive of IGS, not all affected individuals have proteinuria.', 'Celiac artery compression syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by chronic, recurrent abdominal pain related to compression of the celiac artery (which supplies blood to the upper abdominal organs) by the median arcuate ligament (a muscular fibrous band of the diaphragm). It usually presents with symptoms of abdominal pain, weight loss, and an abdominal bruit (abnormal sound of a blood vessel when blocked or narrowed). The cause is not fully understood; however, it is suspected that there could be a combination of vascular (blood supply) and neurogenic (neurological) components involved. Diagnosis is usually confirmed with imaging such as CT angiography, MRI, ultrasound, and arteriography.Surgery is currently the only treatment option and involves releasing the ligament.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of celiac artery compression syndrome?  Classically, individuals with celiac artery compression syndrome present with a triad of abdominal pain after eating, weight loss (usually >20 pounds), and abdominal bruit (abnormal sound of a blood vessel when blocked or narrowed).  One review found that abdominal pain is the most common symptom, found to be present in approximately 80% of individuals, while weight loss was found in approximately 48% and abdominal bruit was appreciated in approximately 35%. Other symptoms include: nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and delayed gastric emptying.', 'What causes celiac artery compression syndrome? The cause of celiac artery syndrome is disputed. While it was initially thought to be caused by a restriction of blood supply secondary to compression of the celiac artery (supplies blood to the upper abdominal organs) by the median arcuate ligament (a muscular fibrous band of the diaphragm), other factors have been proposed. It has been suggested that nerve dysfunction might additionally be involved, which could explain some of the associated symptoms such as pain and delayed gastric emptying.']}"}, "time": 1746283457.365741}
