Plasminogen deficiency, type 1 is caused by a mutation in a gene encoding plasminogen, an enzyme whose function is to dissolve fibrin clots. Fibrin clots form scabs at a wound site.', 'Is plasminogen deficiency, type 1 inherited? If so, in what manner? Plasminogen deficiency, type 1 is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, which means that an individual must inherit two disease-causing mutated copies of the plasminogen gene in order to have the condition and exhibit symptoms.', 'How might type 1 plasminogen deficiency be treated? The treatment options available for type 1 plasminogen deficiency are few. However, some researchers have shown that the ligneous lesions can be reversed by plasminogen infusion, with changes occurring within 3 days and restored to normal after 2 weeks of treatment. Recurrence has been prevented by daily injections with plasminogen sufficient to achieve plasma concentrations to approximately 40% of the normal amount of plasminogen. Treatment with topical plasminogen has also been successful and resulted in dramatic improvement and complete resolution of the membranes. In some women, treatment with oral contraceptives have resulted in an increase in the levels of plasminogen and some resolution of the pseudomembrane.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Nasopharyngeal carcinoma? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Nasopharyngeal carcinoma. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Neoplasm - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.']}"}, "time": 1746283460.789097}
