Even though most infants and toddlers have received all recommended vaccines by age 2, many under-immunized children remain, leaving the potential for outbreaks of disease. Many adolescents and adults are under-immunized as well, missing opportunities to protect themselves against diseases such as Hepatitis B, influenza, and pneumococcal disease. CDC works closely with public health agencies and private partners to improve and sustain immunization coverage and to monitor the safety of vaccines so that this public health success story can be maintained and expanded in the century to come.  \\n  \\n Vaccine Shortages & Delays \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n   \\nThe latest national information about vaccine supplies and guidance for healthcare providers who are facing vaccine shortages or delays \\n     \\n    \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n Potential New Vaccines \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n   \\nResources for finding information on potential vaccines, research and development status, licensure status, etc. \\n       \\n    \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n Vaccines: The Basics \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n   \\nWithout vaccines, epidemics of many preventable diseases could return, resulting in increased \u2013 and unnecessary \u2013 illness, disability, and death. \\n          \\n    \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n FAQ about Vaccines & Diseases they Prevent \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n          \\n    \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n                \\n \\n                \\n \\n \\n \\n                \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\nImages and logos on this website which are trademarked/copyrighted or used with permission of the trademark/copyright or logo holder are not in the public domain.

No person-to-person transmission has been described. \\n \\nLarge animals such as goats, cows, and sheep may become infected with KFD but play a limited role in the transmission of the disease. These animals provide the blood meals for ticks and it is possible for infected animals with viremia to infect other ticks, but transmission of KFDV to humans from these larger animals is extremely rare. Furthermore, there is no evidence of disease transmission via the unpasteurized milk of any of these animals.', 'After an incubation period of 3-8 days, the symptoms of KFD begin suddenly with chills, fever, and headache. Severe muscle pain with vomiting, gastrointestinal symptoms and bleeding problems may occur 3-4 days after initial symptom onset. Patients may experience abnormally low blood pressure, and low platelet, red blood cell, and white blood cell counts. \\n                \\nAfter 1-2 weeks of symptoms, some patients recover without complication. However, the illness is biphasic for a subset of patients (10-20%) who experience a second wave of symptoms at the beginning of the third week. These symptoms include fever and signs of neurological manifestations, such as severe headache, mental disturbances, tremors, and vision deficits. \\n                \\nThe estimated case-fatality rate is from 3 to 5% for KFD.', 'KFD has historically been limited to the western and central districts of Karnataka State, India. However, in November 2012, samples from humans and monkeys tested positive for KFDV in the southernmost district of the State which neighbors Tamil Nadu State and Kerala State, indicating the possibility of wider distribution of KFDV. Additionally, a virus very similar to KFD virus (Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus) has been described in Saudi Arabia. \\n                \\nPeople with recreational or occupational exposure to rural or outdoor settings (e.g., hunters, herders, forest workers, farmers) within Karnataka State are potentially at risk for infection by contact with infected ticks. Seasonality is another important risk factor as more cases are reported during the dry season, from November through June.']}"}, "time": 1746283483.9174001}
