Autoimmune disorders occur if the body\\'s immune system makes antibodies that attack and damage tissues or cells.\\n                \\nAntibodies are a type of protein. They usually help defend the body against infections. In APS, however, the body makes antibodies that mistakenly attack phospholipidsa type of fat.\\n                \\nPhospholipids are found in all living cells and cell membranes, including blood cells and the lining of blood vessels.\\n                \\nWhen antibodies attack phospholipids, cells are damaged. This damage causes blood clots to form in the body\\'s arteries and veins. (These are the vessels that carry blood to your heart and body.)\\n                \\nUsually, blood clotting is a normal bodily process. Blood clots help seal small cuts or breaks on blood vessel walls. This prevents you from losing too much blood. In APS, however, too much blood clotting can block blood flow and damage the body\\'s organs.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nSome people have APS antibodies, but don\\'t ever have signs or symptoms of the disorder. Having APS antibodies doesn\\'t mean that you have APS. To be diagnosed with APS, you must have APS antibodies and a history of health problems related to the disorder.\\n                \\nAPS can lead to many health problems, such as stroke, heart attack, kidney damage, deep vein thrombosis (throm-BO-sis), and pulmonary embolism (PULL-mun-ary EM-bo-lizm).\\n                \\nAPS also can cause pregnancy-related problems, such as multiple miscarriages, a miscarriage late in pregnancy, or a premature birth due to eclampsia (ek-LAMP-se-ah). (Eclampsia, which follows preeclampsia, is a serious condition that causes seizures in pregnant women.)\\n                \\nVery rarely, some people who have APS develop many blood clots within weeks or months. This condition is called catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS).\\n                \\nPeople who have APS also are at higher risk for thrombocytopenia (THROM-bo-si-to-PE-ne-ah). This is a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal number of blood cell fragments called platelets (PLATE-lets). Antibodies destroy the platelets, or theyre used up during the clotting process. Mild to serious bleeding can occur with thrombocytopenia.\\n                \\nAPS can be fatal. Death may occur as a result of large blood clots or blood clots in the heart, lungs, or brain.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nAPS can affect people of any age. However, it\\'s more common in women and people who have other autoimmune or rheumatic (ru-MAT-ik) disorders, such as lupus. (\"Rheumatic\" refers to disorders that affect the joints, bones, or muscles.)\\n                \\nAPS has no cure, but medicines can help prevent its complications. Medicines are used to stop blood clots from forming. They also are used to keep existing clots from getting larger. Treatment for APS is long term.\\n                \\nIf you have APS and another autoimmune disorder, it\\'s important to control that condition as well. When the other condition is controlled, APS may cause fewer problems.', \"Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) occurs if the body's immune system makes antibodies (proteins) that attack phospholipids.\\n                \\nPhospholipids are a type of fat found in all living cells and cell membranes, including blood cells and the lining of blood vessels. What causes the immune system to make antibodies against phospholipids isn't known.\\n                \\nAPS causes unwanted blood clots to form in the body's arteries and veins. Usually, blood clotting is a normal bodily process. It helps seal small cuts or breaks on blood vessel walls. This prevents you from losing too much blood. In APS, however, too much blood clotting can block blood flow and damage the body's organs.\\n                \\nResearchers don't know why APS antibodies cause blood clots to form. Some believe that the antibodies damage or affect the inner lining of the blood vessels, which causes blood clots to form. Others believe that the immune system makes antibodies in response to blood clots damaging the blood vessels.\", 'Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) can affect people of any age. The disorder is more common in women than men, but it affects both sexes.\\n                \\nAPS also is more common in people who have other autoimmune or rheumatic disorders, such as lupus. (\"Rheumatic\" refers to disorders that affect the joints, bones, or muscles.)\\n                \\nAbout 10 percent of all people who have lupus also have APS. About half of all people who have APS also have another autoimmune or rheumatic disorder.\\n                \\nSome people have APS antibodies, but don\\'t ever have signs or symptoms of the disorder. The mere presence of APS antibodies doesn\\'t mean that you have APS. To be diagnosed with APS, you must have APS antibodies and a history of health problems related to the disorder.\\n                \\nHowever, people who have APS antibodies but no signs or symptoms are at risk of developing APS. Health problems, other than autoimmune disorders, that can trigger blood clots include:\\n                \\nSmoking\\n                \\nProlonged bed rest\\n                \\nPregnancy and the postpartum period\\n                \\nBirth control pills and hormone therapy\\n                \\nCancer and kidney disease', \"The signs and symptoms of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) are related to abnormal blood clotting. The outcome of a blood clot depends on its size and location.\\n                \\nBlood clots can form in, or travel to, the arteries or veins in the brain, heart, kidneys, lungs, and limbs. Clots can reduce or block blood flow. This can damage the body's organs and may cause death.\\n                \\nMajor Signs and Symptoms\\n                \\nMajor signs and symptoms of blood clots include:\\n                \\nChest pain and shortness of breath\\n                \\nPain, redness, warmth, and swelling in the limbs\\n                \\nOngoing headaches\\n                \\nSpeech changes\\n                \\nUpper body discomfort in the arms, back, neck, and jaw\\n                \\nNausea (feeling sick to your stomach)\\n                \\nBlood clots can lead to stroke, heart attack, kidney damage, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism.\\n                \\nPregnant women who have APS can have successful pregnancies. However, they're at higher risk for miscarriages, stillbirths, and other pregnancy-related problems, such as preeclampsia (pre-e-KLAMP-se-ah).\\n                \\nPreeclampsia is high blood pressure that occurs during pregnancy. This condition may progress to eclampsia. Eclampsia is a serious condition that causes seizures in pregnant women.\\n                \\nSome people who have APS may develop thrombocytopenia. This is a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal number of blood cell fragments called platelets.\\n                \\nMild to serious bleeding causes the main signs and symptoms of thrombocytopenia. Bleeding can occur inside the body (internal bleeding) or underneath or from the skin (external bleeding).\\n                \\nOther Signs and Symptoms\\n                \\nOther signs and symptoms of APS include chronic (ongoing) headaches, memory loss, and heart valve problems. Some people who have APS also get a lacy-looking red rash on their wrists and knees.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283465.510968}
