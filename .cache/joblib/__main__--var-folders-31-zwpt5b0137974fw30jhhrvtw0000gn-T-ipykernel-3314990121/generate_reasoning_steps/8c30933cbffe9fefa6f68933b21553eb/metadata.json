Stargardt disease is most commonly inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that to be affected, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell. Affected people inherit one mutated copy of the gene from each parent, who is referred to as a carrier. Carriers of an autosomal recessive condition typically do not have any signs or symptoms (they are unaffected). When 2 carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a: 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected 50% (1 in 2) chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent 25% chance to be unaffected and not be a carrier A person with autosomal recessive Stargardt disease will always pass one mutated copy of the gene to each of his/her children. In other words, each of his/her children will at least be a carrier.  A child of an affected person can be affected if the other parent is also affected or is a carrier. In rare cases, Stargardt disease may be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that having a mutation in only one copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause features of the condition. An affected person typically inherits the mutated gene from an affected parent. When a person with a mutation that causes an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit that mutation.', 'Is genetic testing available for Stargardt disease? Yes. Genetic testing may help distinguish the type of Stargardt disease a person has, and provide information about the mode of inheritance and risks to other family members. The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests available for Stargardt disease. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about genetic testing for this condition should speak with their ophthalmologist or a genetics professional.', 'How might Stargardt disease be treated? At present there is no cure for Stargardt disease, and there is very little that can be done to slow its progression. Wearing sunglasses to protect the eyes from UVa, UVb and bright light may be of some benefit. Animal studies have shown that taking excessive amounts of vitamin A and beta carotene could promote the additional accumulation of lipofuscin, as well as a toxic vitamin A derivative called A2E; it is typically recommended that these be avoided by individuals with Stargardt disease. There are possible treatments for Stargardt disease that are being tested, including a gene therapy treatment, which has been given orphan drug status by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA, similar to the FDA). You can read more about this treatment by clicking here. There are also clinical trials involving embryonic stem cell treatments.', \"Children's interstitial and diffuse lung disease (chILD) is not a single condition, but a group of rare lung diseases found in infants, children and adolescents that can range from mild to severe.  All types of chILD decrease a child's ability to supply oxygen to their body.  These diseases make it difficult for the lungs to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide and can cause fluid and other materials to collect in the lungs.  Early diagnosis and treatment is important for any type of chILD.  See the Children's Interstitial Lung Disease Foundation to see a list of different ILDs and to find more information about diagnosis, treatment and help finding a specialist.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283458.0256581}
