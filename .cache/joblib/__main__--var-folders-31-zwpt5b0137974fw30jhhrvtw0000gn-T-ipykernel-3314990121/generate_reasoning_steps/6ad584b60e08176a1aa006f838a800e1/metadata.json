The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Salcedo syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Glomerulopathy 90% Hematuria 90% Hypertension 90% Proteinuria 90% Renal insufficiency 90% Short stature 90% Abnormality of the skeletal system - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Nephropathy - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Autoimmune gastrointestinal dysmotility (AGID) is a rare form of autoimmune autonomic neuropathy that can occur either due to an idiopathic cause or a paraneoplastic cause. Idiopathic forms of AGID are a manifestation of autoimmune autonomic neuropathy that affects the digestive nervous system. The signs and symptoms of AGID may include achalasia,gastroparesis, hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, intestinal pseudo-obstruction, megacolon and anal spasm. Treatment options for AGID includes symptom relief, treatment of any underlying neoplasm if necessary, immunotherapy and supportive treatment. Nutrition and hydration therapy as well as management of abdominal pain are important supportive treatment measures.', 'Tranebjaerg Svejgaard syndrome is a rare condition that is characterized by intellectual disability, seizures and psoriasis. It has been reported in four male cousins. The underlying genetic cause of the condition is currently unknown; however, it is thought to be inherited in an X-linked manner. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person and may include medications to control seizures.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Tranebjaerg Svejgaard syndrome?
