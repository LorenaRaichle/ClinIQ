But it also presents both physical and emotional challenges.        -  Get as much rest as possible. You may find that all you can do is eat, sleep, and care for your baby. And that is perfectly okay. You will have spotting or bleeding, like a menstrual period, off and on for up to six weeks.     - You might also have swelling in your legs and feet, feel constipated, have menstrual-like cramping. Even if you are not breastfeeding, you can have milk leaking from your nipples, and your breasts might feel full, tender, or uncomfortable.     - Follow your doctor\\'s instructions on how much activity, like climbing stairs or walking, you can do for the next few weeks.     - Doctors usually recommend that you abstain from sexual intercourse for four to six weeks after birth.        In addition to physical changes, you may feel sad or have the \"baby blues.\" If you are extremely sad or are unable to care for yourself or your baby, you might have a serious condition called postpartum depression.    Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women\\'s Health', \"Summary : During your teens you go through puberty and become sexually mature. If you're a girl, you develop breasts and begin to get your period. If you're a boy, your penis and testicles become larger. If you have sex, you could get pregnant or get someone pregnant. Whether you choose to have sex or not, it is a good idea to know about safe sex and how sex affects your health. Besides pregnancy, having sex puts you at risk of getting a sexually transmitted disease, such as herpes or genital warts, or HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.    The only way to be completely safe is not to have sex. If you choose to have sex, however, latex condoms are the best protection against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Condoms are also a form of birth control to help prevent pregnancy.\", \"Ultraviolet (UV) rays are an invisible form of radiation. They can pass through your skin and damage your skin cells. Sunburns are a sign of skin damage. Suntans aren't healthy, either. They appear after the sun's rays have already killed some cells and damaged others. UV rays can cause skin damage during any season or at any temperature. They can also cause eye problems, wrinkles, skin spots, and skin cancer.    To protect yourself        -  Stay out of the sun when it is strongest (between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.)    -  Use sunscreen with an SPF of 15 or higher     -  Wear protective clothing     -  Wear wraparound sunglasses that provide 100 percent UV ray protection    -  Avoid sunlamps and tanning beds        Check your skin regularly for changes in the size, shape, color, or feel of birthmarks, moles, and spots. Such changes are a sign of skin cancer.     Food and Drug Administration\", \"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a type of movement disorder. It happens when nerve cells in the brain don't produce enough of a brain chemical called dopamine. Sometimes it is genetic, but most cases do not seem to run in families. Exposure to chemicals in the environment might play a role.    Symptoms begin gradually, often on one side of the body. Later they affect both sides. They include       - Trembling of hands, arms, legs, jaw and face     - Stiffness of the arms, legs and trunk     - Slowness of movement     - Poor balance and coordination        As symptoms get worse, people with the disease may have trouble walking, talking, or doing simple tasks. They may also have problems such as depression, sleep problems, or trouble chewing, swallowing, or speaking.    There is no lab test for PD, so it can be difficult to diagnose. Doctors use a medical history and a neurological examination to diagnose it.    PD usually begins around age 60, but it can start earlier. It is more common in men than in women. There is no cure for PD. A variety of medicines sometimes help symptoms dramatically. Surgery and deep brain stimulation (DBS) can help severe cases. With DBS, electrodes are surgically implanted in the brain. They send electrical pulses to stimulate the parts of the brain that control movement.
