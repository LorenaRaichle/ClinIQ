Most cases of isolated congenital anosmia (not associated with additional symptoms) occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. Rarely, more than one family member may be affected. In these families, the condition appears to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with reduced penetrance. Congenital anosmia can also by associated with specific genetic disorders such as Kallmann syndrome and congenital insensitivity to pain. In these cases, the inheritance varies based on the associated condition. For example, Kallmann syndrome can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive manner depending on the underlying genetic cause (it can be caused by mutations in several different genes). Congenital insensitivity to pain follows an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.', 'How is congenital anosmia diagnosed? Isolated congenital anosmia (not associated with other symptoms) is a diagnosis of exclusion. This means that the diagnosis is made in people with suspicious signs and symptoms once other conditions that cause similar features have been ruled out. When an affected person has no recollection of ever being able to smell, the following tests may be ordered to support a diagnosis of congenital anosmia: A thorough physical examination and medical history to look for other conditions that may interfere with the sense of smell Smell tests, particularly those that determine the smallest amount of odor that someone can detect Brain Imaging (such as CT scan and MRI scan) as some people with congenital anosmia have malformations in the portion of the brian that processes smells Nasal endoscopy to look for abnormalities of the nasal cavity which may interfere with sense of smell Olfactory nerve testing to evaluate disruptions in the pathway that carries information from the nose to the brain', 'How might congenital anosmia be treated? Unfortunately, there is currently no known cure or treatment for congenital anosmia.', 'Bobble-head doll syndrome (BHDS) is a rare neurological condition that is typically first seen in childhood. The signs and symptoms of BHDS include characteristic up and down head movements that increase during walking and excitement and decrease during concentration. Although the specific cause of this condition is unknown, BHDS is often seen with cysts in the third ventricle of the brain that also cause hydrocephalus (water on the brain). Treatment for BHDS may involve surgical removal of the cyst causing the condition or using a shunt to drain excess water on the brain.']}"}, "time": 1746283454.6850328}
