CMT1, most cases of CMT2, and most intermediate forms are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. This pattern of inheritance means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person has one affected parent.  CMT4, a few CMT2 subtypes, and some intermediate forms are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.  CMTX is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. A condition is considered X-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome. The inheritance is dominant if one copy of the altered gene is sufficient to cause the condition. In most cases, affected males, who have the alteration on their only copy of the X chromosome, experience more severe symptoms of the disorder than females, who have two X chromosomes. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons. All daughters of affected men will have one altered X chromosome, but they may only have mild symptoms of the disorder.  Some cases of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease result from a new mutation and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.', 'These resources address the diagnosis or management of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease:  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Charcot-Marie-Tooth Hereditary Neuropathy Overview  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Charcot-Marie-Tooth Neuropathy Type 1  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Charcot-Marie-Tooth Neuropathy Type 2  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Charcot-Marie-Tooth Neuropathy Type 2A  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Charcot-Marie-Tooth Neuropathy Type 2E/1F  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Charcot-Marie-Tooth Neuropathy Type 4  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Charcot-Marie-Tooth Neuropathy Type 4A  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Charcot-Marie-Tooth Neuropathy Type 4C  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Charcot-Marie-Tooth Neuropathy X Type 1  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Charcot-Marie-Tooth Neuropathy X Type 5  - Gene Review: Gene Review: DNM2-Related Intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth Neuropathy  - Gene Review: Gene Review: GARS-Associated Axonal Neuropathy  - Gene Review: Gene Review: TRPV4-Associated Disorders  - Genetic Testing Registry: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease  - Genetic Testing Registry: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease dominant intermediate 3  - Genetic Testing Registry: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1B  - Genetic Testing Registry: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2B  - Genetic Testing Registry: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2B1  - Genetic Testing Registry: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2B2  - Genetic Testing Registry: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2C  - Genetic Testing Registry: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D  - Genetic Testing Registry: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2E  - Genetic Testing Registry: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2F  - Genetic Testing Registry: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2I  - Genetic Testing Registry: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2J  - Genetic Testing Registry: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2K  - Genetic Testing Registry: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2P  - Genetic Testing Registry: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, X-linked recessive, type 5  - Genetic Testing Registry: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, axonal, type 2O  - Genetic Testing Registry: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, axonal, with vocal cord paresis, autosomal recessive  - Genetic Testing Registry: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, dominant intermediate C  - Genetic Testing Registry: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, dominant intermediate E  - Genetic Testing Registry: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, recessive intermediate A  - Genetic Testing Registry: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 1C  - Genetic Testing Registry: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 2A1  - Genetic Testing Registry: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 2A2  - Genetic Testing Registry: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 2L  - Genetic Testing Registry: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 2N  - Genetic Testing Registry: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 4A  - Genetic Testing Registry: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 4B1  - Genetic Testing Registry: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 4B2  - Genetic Testing Registry: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 4C  - Genetic Testing Registry: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 4D  - Genetic Testing Registry: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 4H  - Genetic Testing Registry: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 4J  - Genetic Testing Registry: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type I  - Genetic Testing Registry: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type IA  - Genetic Testing Registry: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type ID  - Genetic Testing Registry: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type IE  - Genetic Testing Registry: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type IF  - Genetic Testing Registry: Congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy  - Genetic Testing Registry: DNM2-related intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy  - Genetic Testing Registry: Dejerine-Sottas disease  - Genetic Testing Registry: Roussy-Lvy syndrome  - Genetic Testing Registry: X-linked hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Hammer Toe  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: High Arch   These resources from MedlinePlus offer information about the diagnosis and management of various health conditions:  - Diagnostic Tests  - Drug Therapy  - Surgery and Rehabilitation  - Genetic Counseling   - Palliative Care', 'Maffucci syndrome is a disorder that primarily affects the bones and skin. It is characterized by multiple enchondromas, which are noncancerous (benign) growths of cartilage that develop within the bones. These growths most commonly occur in the limb bones, especially in the bones of the hands and feet; however, they may also occur in the skull, ribs, and bones of the spine (vertebrae). Enchondromas may result in severe bone deformities, shortening of the limbs, and fractures.  The signs and symptoms of Maffucci syndrome may be detectable at birth, although they generally do not become apparent until around the age of 5. Enchondromas develop near the ends of bones, where normal growth occurs, and they frequently stop forming after affected individuals stop growing in early adulthood. As a result of the bone deformities associated with Maffucci syndrome, people with this disorder generally have short stature and underdeveloped muscles.  Maffucci syndrome is distinguished from a similar disorder that involves enchondromas (Ollier disease) by the presence of red or purplish growths in the skin consisting of tangles of abnormal blood vessels (hemangiomas). In addition to hemangiomas, individuals with Maffucci syndrome occasionally also have lymphangiomas, which are masses made up of the thin tubes that carry lymph fluid (lymphatic vessels). These growths may appear anywhere on the body.  Although the enchondromas associated with Maffucci syndrome start out as benign, they may become cancerous (malignant). In particular, affected individuals may develop bone cancers called chondrosarcomas, especially in the skull. People with Maffucci syndrome also have an increased risk of other cancers, such as ovarian or liver cancer.  People with Maffucci syndrome usually have a normal lifespan, and intelligence is unaffected. The extent of their physical impairment depends on their individual skeletal deformities, but in most cases they have no major limitations in their activities.', 'Maffucci syndrome is very rare. Since it was first described in 1881, fewer than 200 cases have been reported worldwide.']}"}, "time": 1746283448.0860648}
