Humans can contract CHHF through contact with an infected rodent. Contact can be direct or through inhalation of aerosolized Chapare virus from the urine or feces of infected rodents. \\n \\nAlthough arenaviruses have been isolated from insects, neither they nor any other intermediary host appear to spread CHHF. \\n \\nPerson-to-person transmission of arenaviruses through aerosolization, although possible, is rare. From the only observed cluster of cases of CHHF, there was no evidence of person-to-person transmission. \\n \\nTransmission, if it can occur with CHHF, is most likely the result of direct contact with an infected person.', 'The symptoms of CHHF, as reported in the only described patient, resemble those of other South American hemorrhagic fevers, such as Argentine HF or Bolivian HF. The incubation period is unknown, but for Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF) is 6 to 16 days. \\n   \\nThe CHHF clinical course included: \\n    \\n    - fever \\n    - headache \\n    - articulation and muscle pain \\n    - vomiting \\n    \\n   \\nThese symptoms were followed by deterioration with multiple hemorrhagic signs. The only described CHHF patient died 14 days after onset of symptoms. \\n   \\nSince Arenaviruses may enter the fetus through infection of the mother, and anecdotal evidence suggests that infected pregnant women may suffer miscarriages, it is reasonable to assume that both infection of the fetus and miscarriage may be associated with CHHF infection in the mother.', 'CHHF occurs in the Cochabamba region of Bolivia. \\nField workers \\n                \\nField workers are at greatest risk because of increased human contact with the reservoir rodent population. Sexual partners of field workers may be at greater risk as well. Laboratory infections have been frequently described with Arenaviruses and Chapare virus can certainly be transmitted to laboratory workers during manipulation of the virus especially during experimental infections of rodents.']}"}, "time": 1746283483.953067}
