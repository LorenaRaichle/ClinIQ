The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Premature ovarian failure, familial. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of metabolism/homeostasis - Increased circulating gonadotropin level - Menstrual irregularities - Premature ovarian failure - X-linked inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', \"Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a rare form of adenocarcinoma, which is cancer that begins in gladular tissues. ACC most commonly arises in the head and neck, in various parts of the major and minor salivary glands including the palate, nasopharynx, lining of the mouth, voice box (larynx) or windpipe (trachea). It can also occur in the breast, uterus, or other locations in the body. Early symptoms depend on the tumor's location and may include lumps under the lining of the mouth or facial skin; numbness in the mouth or face; difficulty swallowing; hoarseness; pain; or paralysis of a facial nerve. ACC often has long periods with no growth followed by growth spurts; however, it can be aggressive in some people. ACC spreads along nerves or through the bloodstream, and only spreads to the lymph nodes in about 5-10% of cases. The cause of ACC is currently unknown. Treatment depends on many factors and may include surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy.\", 'What causes adenoid cystic carcinoma? The underlying cause of adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is not yet known, and no strong genetic or environmental risk factors specific to ACC have been identified. Researchers believe that a combination of various genetic and environmental factors probably interact to ultimately cause a person to develop specific types of cancers. There is ongoing research to learn more about the many factors that contribute to the development of cancer. Cancer is at least partly due to acquired (not inherited) damage or changes to the DNA in certain cells. For example, various studies have shown that chromosomal abnormalities and genetic deletions are present in samples of ACC. However, these genetic abnormalities are present only in the cancer cells, not in the cells with the genetic material that is passed on to offspring (the egg and sperm cells).', 'Is adenoid cystic carcinoma inherited? While the underlying cause of adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is not known, no strong genetic risk factors have been identified. To our knowledge, only one case of apparent familial ACC has been reported worldwide. In this case, a father and daughter were both affected with ACC of the sublingual salivary gland. While ACC appears to generally be sporadic (occurring in people with no family history of ACC), there has been speculation about a possible linkage between salivary gland cancers in general and inherited BRCA gene mutations. However, this potential link needs further investigation. There has also been one report of a case of ACC of the salivary gland occurring in a person with basal cell nevus syndrome, a hereditary syndrome known to predispose affected people to a very wide range of tumors.']}"}, "time": 1746283454.6326668}
