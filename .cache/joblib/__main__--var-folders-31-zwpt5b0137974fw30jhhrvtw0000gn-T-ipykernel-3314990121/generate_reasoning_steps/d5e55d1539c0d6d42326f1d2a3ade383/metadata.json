Sometimes it involves direct attacks such as hitting, name calling, teasing or taunting. Sometimes it is indirect, such as spreading rumors or trying to make others reject someone.     Often people dismiss bullying among kids as a normal part of growing up. But bullying is harmful. It can lead children and teenagers to feel tense and afraid. It may lead them to avoid school. In severe cases, teens who are bullied may feel they need to take drastic measures or react violently. Others even consider suicide. For some, the effects of bullying last a lifetime.     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Summary : Food provides the energy and nutrients you need to be healthy. Nutrients include proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, minerals, and water.     Healthy eating is not hard. The key is to       -  Eat a variety of foods, including vegetables, fruits, and whole-grain products    -  Eat lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, and low-fat dairy products     -  Drink lots of water    -  Limit salt, sugar, alcohol, saturated fat, and trans fat in your diet       Saturated fats are usually fats that come from animals. Look for trans fat on the labels of processed foods, margarines, and shortenings.    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', \"Summary : Your newborn infant has screening tests before leaving the hospital. There may be different tests depending on the state where you live. They include       - Tests on a few drops of blood from pricking the baby's heel. The tests look for inherited disorders. All states test for at least 30 of these conditions.    - A hearing test that measures the baby's response to sound    - A skin test that measures the level of oxygen in the blood. This can tell if the baby has a congenital heart defect.       These tests look for serious medical conditions. If not treated, some of these conditions can cause lifelong health problems. Others can cause early death. With early diagnosis, treatment can begin right away, before serious problems can occur or become permanent.    If a screening shows that your baby might have a condition, the health care provider or the state health department will call you. It is important to follow up quickly. Further testing can verify whether your baby has the condition. If so, treatment should start right away.
