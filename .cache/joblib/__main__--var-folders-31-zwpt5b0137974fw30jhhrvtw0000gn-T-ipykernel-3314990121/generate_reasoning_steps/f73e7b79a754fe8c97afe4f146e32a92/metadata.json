A blood test called a lipoprotein panel can measure your cholesterol levels. Before the test, youll need to fast (not eat or drink anything but water) for 9 to 12 hours.\\n                \\nThe lipoprotein panel will give your doctor information about your:\\n                \\nTotal cholesterol. Total cholesterol is a measure of the total amount of cholesterol in your blood, including low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.\\n                \\nLDL cholesterol. LDL, or bad, cholesterol is the main source of cholesterol buildup and blockages in the arteries.\\n                \\nHDL cholesterol. HDL, or good, cholesterol helps remove cholesterol from your arteries.\\n                \\nTriglycerides (tri-GLIH-seh-rides). Triglycerides are a type of fat found in your blood. Some studies suggest that a high level of triglycerides in the blood may raise the risk of coronary heart disease, especially in women.\\n                \\nIf its not possible to have a lipoprotein panel, knowing your total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol can give you a general idea about your cholesterol levels.\\n                \\nTesting for total and HDL cholesterol does not require fasting. If your total cholesterol is 200 mg/dL or more, or if your HDL cholesterol is less than 40 mg/dL, your doctor will likely recommend that you have a lipoprotein panel. (Cholesterol is measured as milligrams (mg) of cholesterol per deciliter (dL) of blood.)\\n                \\nThe tables below show total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol levels and their corresponding categories.

The score, given as a percentage, refers to your chance of having a heart attack in the next 10years.\\n                \\nBased on your medical history, number of risk factors, and risk score, figure out your risk of getting heart disease or having a heart attack using the table below.\\n                \\n* Some people in this category are at very high risk because theyve just had a heart attack or they have diabetes and heart disease, severe risk factors, or metabolic syndrome. If youre at very high risk, your doctor may set your LDL goal even lower, to less than 70 mg/dL. Your doctor also may set your LDL goal at this lower level if you have heart disease alone.\\n                \\nAfter following the above steps, you should have an idea about your risk for heart disease and heart attack. The two main ways to lower your cholesterol (and, thus, your heart disease risk) include:\\n                \\nTherapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC). TLC is a three-part program that includes a healthy diet, weight management, and physical activity. TLC is for anyone whose LDL cholesterol level is above goal.\\n                \\nMedicines. If cholesterol-lowering medicines are needed, theyre used with the TLC program to help lower your LDL cholesterol level.\\n                \\nYour doctor will set your LDL goal. The higher your risk for heart disease, the lower he or she will set your LDL goal. Using the following guide, you and your doctor can create a plan for treating your high blood cholesterol.\\n                \\nCategory I, high risk, your LDL goal is less than 100 mg/dL.*\\n                \\n* Your LDL goal may be set even lower, to less than 70 mg/dL, if youre at very high risk or if you have heart disease. If you have this lower goal and your LDL is 70 mg/dL or higher, youll need to begin the TLC diet and take medicines as prescribed.\\n                \\nCategory II, moderately high risk, your LDL goal is less than 130 mg/dL\\n                \\nCategory III, moderate risk, your LDL goal is less than 130 mg/dL.\\n                \\nCategory IV, low to moderate risk, your LDL goal is less than 160 mg/dL.\\n                \\n\\n                \\nLowering Cholesterol Using Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes\\n                \\n\\n                \\nTLC is a set of lifestyle changes that can help you lower your LDL cholesterol. The main parts of the TLC program are a healthy diet, weight management, and physical activity.\\n                \\nThe TLC Diet\\n                \\nWith the TLC diet, less than 7 percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. This kind of fat is found in some meats, dairy products, chocolate, baked goods, and deep-fried and processed foods.\\n                \\nNo more than 25 to 35 percent of your daily calories should come from all fats, including saturated, trans, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats.\\n                \\nYou also should have less than 200 mg a day of cholesterol. The amounts of cholesterol and the types of fat in prepared foods can be found on the foods\\' Nutrition Facts labels.\\n                \\nFoods high in soluble fiber also are part of the TLC diet. They help prevent the digestive tract from absorbing cholesterol. These foods include:\\n                \\nWhole-grain cereals such as oatmeal and oat bran\\n                \\nFruits such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes\\n                \\nLegumes such as kidney beans, lentils, chick peas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans\\n                \\nA diet rich in fruits and vegetables can increase important cholesterol-lowering compounds in your diet. These compounds, called plant stanols or sterols, work like soluble fiber.\\n                \\nA healthy diet also includes some types of fish, such as salmon, tuna (canned or fresh), and mackerel. These fish are a good source of omega-3 fatty acids. These acids may help protect the heart from blood clots and inflammation and reduce the risk of heart attack. Try to have about two fish meals every week.\\n                \\nYou also should try to limit the amount of sodium (salt) that you eat. This means choosing low-salt and \"no added salt\" foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. The Nutrition Facts label on food packaging shows the amount of sodium in the item.\\n                \\nTry to limit drinks with alcohol. Too much alcohol will raise your blood pressure and triglyceride level. (Triglycerides are a type of fat found in the blood.) Alcohol also adds extra calories, which will cause weight gain.\\n                \\nMen should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is a glass of wine, beer, or a small amount of hard liquor.\\n                \\nFor more information about TLC, go to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBIs) \"Your Guide to Lowering Your Cholesterol With TLC.\"\\n                \\nWeight Management\\n                \\nIf youre overweight or obese, losing weight can help lower LDL cholesterol. Maintaining a healthy weight is especially important if you have a condition called metabolic syndrome.\\n                \\nMetabolic syndrome is the name for a group of risk factors that raise your risk for heart disease and other health problems, such as diabetes and stroke.\\n                \\nThe five metabolic risk factors are a large waistline (abdominal obesity), a high triglyceride level, a low HDL cholesterol level, high blood pressure, and high blood sugar. Metabolic syndrome is diagnosed if you have at least three of these metabolic risk factors.\\n                \\nPhysical Activity\\n                \\nRoutine physical activity can lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and raise your HDL cholesterol level.\\n                \\nPeople gain health benefits from as little as 60 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week. The more active you are, the more you will benefit.\\n                \\nFor more information about physical activity, go to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\\' \"2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans,\" the Health Topics Physical Activity and Your Heart article, and the NHLBI\\'s \"Your Guide to Physical Activity and Your Heart.\"\\n                \\nCholesterol-Lowering Medicines\\n                \\nIn addition to lifestyle changes, your doctor may prescribe medicines to help lower your cholesterol. Even with medicines, you should continue the TLC program.\\n                \\nMedicines can help control high blood cholesterol, but they dont cure it. Thus, you must continue taking your medicine to keep your cholesterol level in the recommended range.\\n                \\nThe five major types of cholesterol-lowering medicines are statins, bile acid sequestrants (seh-KWES-trants), nicotinic (nick-o-TIN-ick) acid, fibrates, and ezetimibe.\\n                \\nStatins work well at lowering LDL cholesterol. These medicines are safe for most people. Rare side effects include muscle and liver problems.\\n                \\nBile acid sequestrants also help lower LDL cholesterol. These medicines usually arent prescribed as the only medicine to lower cholesterol. Sometimes theyre prescribed with statins.\\n                \\nNicotinic acid lowers LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and raises HDL cholesterol. You should only use this type of medicine with a doctors supervision.\\n                \\nFibrates lower triglycerides, and they may raise HDL cholesterol. When used with statins, fibrates may increase the risk of muscle problems.\\n                \\nEzetimibe lowers LDL cholesterol. This medicine works by blocking the intestine from absorbing cholesterol.\\n                \\nWhile youre being treated for high blood cholesterol, youll need ongoing care. Your doctor will want to make sure your cholesterol levels are controlled. He or she also will want to check for other health problems.\\n                \\nIf needed, your doctor may prescribe medicines for other health problems. Take all medicines exactly as your doctor prescribes. The combination of medicines may lower your risk for heart disease and heart attack.\\n                \\nWhile trying to manage your cholesterol, take steps to manage other heart disease risk factors too. For example, if you have high blood pressure, work with your doctor to lower it.\\n                \\nIf you smoke, quit. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. If youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. Your doctor can help you create a reasonable weight-loss plan.', \"Espaol\\n                \\nA heart attack happens when the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked and the heart cant get oxygen.

These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart.\\n                \\nWhen plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis. The buildup of plaque occurs over many years.\\n                \\nEventually, an area of plaque can rupture (break open) inside of an artery. This causes a blood clot to form on the plaque's surface. If the clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block blood flow through a coronary artery.\\n                \\nIf the blockage isn't treated quickly, the portion of heart muscle fed by the artery begins to die. Healthy heart tissue is replaced with scar tissue. This heart damage may not be obvious, or it may cause severe or long-lasting problems.\\n                \\nHeart With Muscle Damage and a Blocked Artery\\n                \\n\\n                \\nA less common cause of heart attack is a severe spasm (tightening) of a coronary artery.

The symptoms of a heart attack can vary from person to person. Some people can have few symptoms and are surprised to learn they've had a heart attack. If you've already had a heart attack, your symptoms may not be the same for another one.\\n                \\nQuick Action Can Save Your Life: Call 911\\n                \\nIf you think you or someone else may be having heart attack symptoms or a heart attack, don't ignore it or feel embarrassed to call for help.
