Your infant's doctor may notice signs or symptoms during a routine checkup. Some parents also notice cyanosis or poor feeding and bring the baby to the doctor. (Cyanosis is a bluish tint to the skin, lips, and fingernails.)\\n                \\nSpecialists Involved\\n                \\nIf your child has tetralogy of Fallot, a pediatric cardiologist and pediatric cardiac surgeon may be involved in his or her care.\\n                \\nA pediatric cardiologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating heart problems in children. Pediatric cardiac surgeons repair children's heart defects using surgery.\\n                \\nPhysical Exam\\n                \\nDuring a physical exam, the doctor may:\\n                \\nListen to your baby's heart and lungs with a stethoscope.\\n                \\nLook for signs of a heart defect, such as a bluish tint to the skin, lips, or fingernails and rapid breathing.\\n                \\nLook at your baby's general appearance. Some children who have tetralogy of Fallot also have DiGeorge syndrome. This syndrome causes characteristic facial traits, such as wide-set eyes.\\n                \\nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\\n                \\nYour child's doctor may recommend several tests to diagnose tetralogy of Fallot. These tests can provide information about the four heart defects that occur in tetralogy of Fallot and how serious they are.\\n                \\nEchocardiography\\n                \\nEchocardiography (echo) is a painless test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of the heart. During the test, the sound waves (called ultrasound) bounce off the structures of the heart. A computer converts the sound waves into pictures on a screen.\\n                \\nEcho allows the doctor to clearly see any problem with the way the heart is formed or the way it's working.\\n                \\nEcho is an important test for diagnosing tetralogy of Fallot because it shows the four heart defects and how the heart is responding to them. This test helps the cardiologist decide when to repair the defects and what type of surgery to use.\\n                \\nEcho also is used to check a child's condition over time, after the defects have been repaired.\\n                \\nEKG (Electrocardiogram)\\n                \\nAn EKG is a simple, painless test that records the heart's electrical activity. The test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through the heart.\\n                \\nThis test can help the doctor find out whether your child's right ventricle is enlarged (ventricular hypertrophy).\\n                \\nChest X Ray\\n                \\nA chest x ray is a painless test that creates pictures of the structures in the chest, such as the heart and lungs. This test can show whether the heart is enlarged or whether the lungs have extra blood flow or extra fluid, a sign of heart failure.\\n                \\nPulse Oximetry\\n                \\nFor this test, a small sensor is attached to a finger or toe (like an adhesive bandage). The sensor gives an estimate of how much oxygen is in the blood.\\n                \\nCardiac Catheterization\\n                \\nDuring cardiac catheterization (KATH-eh-ter-ih-ZA-shun), a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a vein in the arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck. The tube is threaded to the heart.\\n                \\nSpecial dye is injected through the catheter into a blood vessel or one of the heart's chambers. The dye allows the doctor to see the flow of blood through the heart and blood vessels on an x-ray image.\\n                \\nThe doctor also can use cardiac catheterization to measure the pressure and oxygen level inside the heart chambers and blood vessels. This can help the doctor figure out whether blood is mixing between the two sides of the heart.\", 'Tetralogy of Fallot is repaired with open-heart surgery, either soon after birth or later in infancy. The goal of surgery is to repair the four defects of tetralogy of Fallot so the heart can work as normally as possible. Repairing the defects can greatly improve a child\\'s health and quality of life.\\n                \\nThe pediatric cardiologist and cardiac surgeon will decide the best time to do the surgery. They will base their decision on your baby\\'s health and weight and the severity of the defects and symptoms.\\n                \\nSome teenagers or adults who had tetralogy of Fallot repaired in childhood need additional surgery to correct heart problems that develop over time. For more information, go to \"Living With Tetralogy of Fallot.\"\\n                \\nTypes of Surgery\\n                \\nComplete Intracardiac Repair\\n                \\nSurgery to repair tetralogy of Fallot improves blood flow to the lungs. Surgery also ensures that oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood flow to the right places.\\n                \\nThe surgeon will:\\n                \\nWiden the narrowed pulmonary blood vessels. The pulmonary valve is widened or replaced. Also, the passage from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery is enlarged. These procedures improve blood flow to the lungs. This allows the blood to get enough oxygen to meet the body\\'s needs.\\n                \\nRepair the ventricular septal defect (VSD). A patch is used to cover the hole in the septum. This patch stops oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood from mixing between the ventricles.\\n                \\nFixing these two defects resolves problems caused by the other two defects. When the right ventricle no longer has to work so hard to pump blood to the lungs, it will return to a normal thickness. Fixing the VSD means that only oxygen-rich blood will flow out of the left ventricle into the aorta.\\n                \\nThe incision (cut) that the surgeon makes to reach the heart usually heals in about 6weeks. The surgeon or a hospital staff member will explain when it\\'s okay to give your baby a bath, pick him or her up under the arms, and take your baby for regular shots (immunizations).\\n                \\nTemporary or Palliative Surgery\\n                \\nIt was common in the past to do temporary surgery during infancy for tetralogy of Fallot. This surgery improved blood flow to the lungs. A complete repair of the four defects was done later in childhood.\\n                \\nNow, tetralogy of Fallot usually is fully repaired in infancy. However, some babies are too weak or too small to have the full repair. They must have temporary surgery first. This surgery improves oxygen levels in the blood. The surgery also gives the baby time to grow and get strong enough for the full repair.\\n                \\nFor temporary surgery, the surgeon places a tube between a large artery branching off the aorta and the pulmonary artery. The tube is called a shunt. One end of the shunt is sewn to the artery branching off the aorta. The other end is sewn to the pulmonary artery.\\n                \\nThe shunt creates an additional pathway for blood to travel to the lungs to get oxygen. The surgeon removes the shunt when the baby\\'s heart defects are fixed during the full repair.\\n                \\nAfter temporary surgery, your baby may need medicines to keep the shunt open while waiting for the full repair. These medicines are stopped after the surgeon removes the shunt.', 'Thalassemias (thal-a-SE-me-ahs) are inherited blood disorders. \"Inherited\" means that the disorder is passed from parents to children through genes.\\n                \\nThalassemias cause the body to make fewer healthy red blood cells and less hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin) than normal. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in red blood cells. It carries oxygen to all parts of the body. Hemoglobin also carries carbon dioxide (a waste gas) from the body to the lungs, where it\\'s exhaled.\\n                \\nPeople who have thalassemias can have mild or severe anemia (uh-NEE-me-uh). Anemia is caused by a lower than normal number of red blood cells or not enough hemoglobin in the red blood cells.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nNormal hemoglobin, also called hemoglobin A, has four protein chainstwo alpha globin and two beta globin. The two major types of thalassemia, alpha and beta, are named after defects in these protein chains.\\n                \\nFour genes (two from each parent) are needed to make enough alpha globin protein chains. Alpha thalassemia trait occurs if one or two of the four genes are missing. If more than two genes are missing, moderate to severe anemia occurs.\\n                \\nThe most severe form of alpha thalassemia is called alpha thalassemia major or hydrops fetalis. Babies who have this disorder usually die before or shortly after birth.\\n                \\nTwo genes (one from each parent) are needed to make enough beta globin protein chains. Beta thalassemia occurs if one or both genes are altered.\\n                \\nThe severity of beta thalassemia depends on how much one or both genes are affected. If both genes are affected, the result is moderate to severe anemia. The severe form of beta thalassemia is known as thalassemia major or Cooley\\'s anemia.\\n                \\nThalassemias affect males and females. The disorders occur most often among people of Italian, Greek, Middle Eastern, Southern Asian, and African descent. Severe forms usually are diagnosed in early childhood and are lifelong conditions.\\n                \\nDoctors diagnose thalassemias using blood tests. The disorders are treated with blood transfusions, medicines, and other procedures.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nTreatments for thalassemias have improved over the years. People who have moderate or severe thalassemias are now living longer and have better quality of life.\\n                \\nHowever, complications from thalassemias and their treatments are frequent. People who have moderate or severe thalassemias must closely follow their treatment plans. They need to take care of themselves to remain as healthy as possible.', 'Your body makes three types of blood cells: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets (PLATE-lets). Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, an iron-rich protein that carries oxygen from your lungs to all parts of your body. Hemoglobin also carries carbon dioxide (a waste gas) from your body to your lungs, where it\\'s exhaled.\\n                \\nHemoglobin has two kinds of protein chains: alpha globin and beta globin. If your body doesn\\'t make enough of these protein chains or they\\'re abnormal, red blood cells won\\'t form correctly or carry enough oxygen. Your body won\\'t work well if your red blood cells don\\'t make enough healthy hemoglobin.\\n                \\nGenes control how the body makes hemoglobin protein chains. When these genes are missing or altered, thalassemias occur.\\n                \\nThalassemias are inherited disordersthat is, they\\'re passed from parents to children through genes. People who inherit faulty hemoglobin genes from one parent but normal genes from the other are called carriers. Carriers often have no signs of illness other than mild anemia. However, they can pass the faulty genes on to their children.\\n                \\nPeople who have moderate to severe forms of thalassemia have inherited faulty genes from both parents.\\n                \\nAlpha Thalassemias\\n                \\nYou need four genes (two from each parent) to make enough alpha globin protein chains. If one or more of the genes is missing, you\\'ll have alpha thalassemia trait or disease. This means that your body doesn\\'t make enough alpha globin protein.\\n                \\nIf you\\'re only missing one gene, you\\'re a \"silent\" carrier. This means you won\\'t have any signs of illness.\\n                \\nIf you\\'re missing two genes, you have alpha thalassemia trait (also called alpha thalassemia minor). You may have mild anemia.\\n                \\nIf you\\'re missing three genes, you likely have hemoglobin H disease (which a blood test can detect). This form of thalassemia causes moderate to severe anemia.\\n                \\nVery rarely, a baby is missing all four genes. This condition is called alpha thalassemia major or hydrops fetalis. Babies who have hydrops fetalis usually die before or shortly after birth.\\n                \\nExample of an Inheritance Pattern for Alpha Thalassemia\\n                \\n\\n                \\nBeta Thalassemias\\n                \\nYou need two genes (one from each parent) to make enough beta globin protein chains. If one or both of these genes are altered, you\\'ll have beta thalassemia. This means that your body wont make enough beta globin protein.\\n                \\nIf you have one altered gene, you\\'re a carrier. This condition is called beta thalassemia trait or beta thalassemia minor. It causes mild anemia.\\n                \\nIf both genes are altered, you\\'ll have beta thalassemia intermedia or beta thalassemia major (also called Cooley\\'s anemia). The intermedia form of the disorder causes moderate anemia. The major form causes severe anemia.\\n                \\nExample of an Inheritance Pattern for Beta Thalassemia']}"}, "time": 1746283466.442733}
