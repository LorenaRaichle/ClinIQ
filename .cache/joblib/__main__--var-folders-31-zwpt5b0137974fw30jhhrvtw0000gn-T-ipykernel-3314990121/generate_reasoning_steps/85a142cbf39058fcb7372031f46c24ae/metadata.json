The deletion occurs near the end of the long arm (or q arm) at a location designated as q13.3. The signs and symptoms of this condition vary widely from person to person. Common symptoms include low muscle tone (hypotonia), intellectual disability, delayed or absent speech, abnormal growth, tendency to overheat, large hands, and abnormal toenails. Affected individuals may have characteristic behaviors, such as mouthing or chewing on non-food items, decreased perception of pain, and autistic-like behaviors. The loss of a particular gene on chromosome 22, called the SHANK3 gene, is likely responsible for many of the signs and symptoms of 22q13.3 deletion syndrome. Additional genes within the deleted region probably contribute to the variable features of the syndrome.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of 22q13.3 deletion syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for 22q13.3 deletion syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Ellis-Van Creveld syndrome is an inherited condition that affects bone growth. Affected people generally have short stature; short arms and legs (especially the forearm and lower leg); and a narrow chest with short ribs. Other signs and symptoms may include polydactyly; missing and/or malformed nails; dental abnormalities; and congenital heart defects. More than half of people affected by Ellis-van Creveld syndrome have changes (mutations) in the EVC or EVC2 genes; the cause of the remaining cases is unknown. The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Ellis-Van Creveld syndrome?
