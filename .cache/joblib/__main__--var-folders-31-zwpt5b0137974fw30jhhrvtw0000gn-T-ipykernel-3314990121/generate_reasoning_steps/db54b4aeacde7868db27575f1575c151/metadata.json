Yes. GeneTests lists the names of laboratories that are performing clincial genetic testing for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2F. To view the contact information for these laboratories, click here. Please note that most of the laboratories listed through GeneTests do not accept direct contact from patients and their families; therefore, if you are interested in learning more, you will need to work with a health care provider or a genetics professional.', \"How might Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2F be treated? Treatment for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 mainly focuses on the specific symptoms present. Affected individuals are often managed by a team of various specialists that includes neurologists, physiatrists, orthopedic surgeons, and physical and occupational therapists. Depending on the individual's signs and symptoms, the following may be indicated: Special shoes, including those with good ankle support Ankle/foot orthoses (AFO) to correct foot drop and aid with walking Orthopedic surgery to correct severe pes cavus Forearm crutches or canes for stability (fewer than 5% of affected individuals need wheelchairs) Treatment of sleep apnea or restless legs Treatment of pain and depression as needed\", 'What are the signs and symptoms of Hypoparathyroidism-retardation-dysmorphism syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Hypoparathyroidism-retardation-dysmorphism syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Cognitive impairment 90% Convex nasal ridge 90% Deeply set eye 90% Delayed skeletal maturation 90% Depressed nasal bridge 90% External ear malformation 90% Frontal bossing 90% High forehead 90% Hyperphosphatemia 90% Hypocalcemia 90% Hypoparathyroidism 90% Intrauterine growth retardation 90% Long philtrum 90% Low-set, posteriorly rotated ears 90% Microcephaly 90% Seizures 90% Short foot 90% Short palm 90% Short stature 90% Thin vermilion border 90% Abnormality of dental enamel 50% Recurrent respiratory infections 50% Aplasia/Hypoplasia affecting the eye 7.5% Astigmatism 7.5% Cellular immunodeficiency 7.5% Cryptorchidism 7.5% Hypoplasia of penis 7.5% Increased bone mineral density 7.5% Intestinal obstruction 7.5% Myopathy 7.5% Opacification of the corneal stroma 7.5% Spinal canal stenosis 7.5% Ventriculomegaly 7.5% Autosomal recessive inheritance - Bifid uvula - Congenital hypoparathyroidism - Hypocalcemic seizures - Intellectual disability - Low-set ears - Micropenis - Patchy osteosclerosis - Posteriorly rotated ears - Postnatal growth retardation - Prominent forehead - Recurrent bacterial infections - Severe intrauterine growth retardation - Small hand - Tetany - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Autosomal dominant deafness-onychodystrophy syndrome?
