The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Intellectual disability-developmental delay-contractures syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of movement 90% Clinodactyly of the 5th finger 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Limitation of joint mobility 90% Neurological speech impairment 90% Ophthalmoparesis 90% Skeletal muscle atrophy 90% Kyphosis 7.5% Ptosis 7.5% Scoliosis 7.5% Strabismus 7.5% Oculomotor apraxia 5% Apnea - Apraxia - Areflexia - Broad alveolar ridges - Camptodactyly - Cerebral atrophy - Congenital foot contractures - Congenital onset - Decreased fetal movement - Delayed myelination - Delayed speech and language development - Distal amyotrophy - Drooling - Dystonia - Facial palsy - Feeding difficulties - High anterior hairline - High palate - Hip dislocation - Hyperlordosis - Intellectual disability, mild - Long philtrum - Low-set ears - Muscular hypotonia - Narrow chest - Neonatal respiratory distress - Proximal placement of thumb - Retrognathia - Seizures - Short neck - Short stature - Smooth philtrum - Spasticity - Talipes equinovarus - Upslanted palpebral fissure - U-Shaped upper lip vermilion - X-linked recessive inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'How is intellectual disability-developmental delay-contractures syndrome inherited? Intellectual disability-developmental delay-contractures syndrome syndrome is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner and is caused by mutations in the ZC4H2 gene. A condition is considered X-linked if the gene with the mutation that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation must be present in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. As such, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. In X-linked recessive inheritance, a female with one mutated copy of the gene in each cell is called a carrier. She can pass on the altered gene, but usually does not experience signs and symptoms of the disorder. Rarely, female carriers of a ZC4H2 gene mutation have been reported to exhibit mild symptoms.', 'Eosinophilic enteropathy is a condition that causes a type of white blood cell called an eosinophil to build up in the gastrointestinal system and in the blood. Eosinophils play a role in the bodys immune response by releasing toxins. Eosinophils are associated with allergic-type reactions, but their specific function is largely unknown.When eosinophils build up in the gastrointestinal tract, this begins to affect the body by causing polyps, tissue break down, inflammation, and ulcers. Eosinophilic enteropathy can occur in children or adults and is characterized by intolerance to some foods. Eosinophilic enteropathy can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, and is often named by the part affected: colon (colitis), esophagus (esophagitis), stomach (gastritis), or both the stomach and small intestine (gastroenteritis).', 'What are the signs and symptoms of eosinophilic enteropathy? The symptoms of eosinophilic gastroenteritis vary depending on where the eosinophils build up in the gastrointestinal system and which layers of the intestinal wall are involved. Symptoms often include pain, skin rash, acid reflux, anemia, diarrhea, stomach cramps, bleeding, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, blood loss in stools, and choking. Symptoms can occur at any age, although they usually develop between ages 20 and 50 years. The symptoms of eosinophilic enteropathy overlap with other gastrointestinal disorders, such as ulcerative colitis, which makes diagnosis difficult. It is common for individuals with this disorder to have symptoms for many years before an accurate diagnosis is made.']}"}, "time": 1746283456.2225568}
