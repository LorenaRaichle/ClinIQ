Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), kyphoscoliosis type is caused by changes (mutations) in the PLOD1 gene. This gene encodes an enzyme that helps process molecules which allow collagen to form stable interactions with one another. Collagen is a protein that provides structure and strength to connective tissues throughout the body. Mutations in the PLOD1 gene lead to reduced levels of functional enzyme which disrupt networks of collagen throughout the body. This weakens the connective tissues and leads to the characteristic signs and symptoms associated with EDS, kyphoscoliosis type.', 'Is Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, kyphoscoliotic type inherited? Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, kyphoscoliosis type is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that to be affected, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell. The parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier.', 'How is Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, kyphoscoliosis type diagnosed? A diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), kyphoscoliosis type is typically based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms. The following tests may then be recommended to confirm the diagnosis: Urine tests and/or a skin biopsy to detect deficiencies in certain enzymes that are important for collagen formation Genetic testing for a change (mutation) in the PLOD1 gene', \"How might Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, kyphoscoliosis type be treated? The treatment of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), kyphoscoliosis type is focused on preventing serious complications and relieving associated signs and symptoms. For example, physical therapy may be recommended in children with hypotonia and delayed motor development. This treatment can also help improve joint stability. Assistive devices such as braces may be necessary depending on the severity of joint instability. Depending on the severity of the kyphoscoliosis (kyphosis and scoliosis), surgery may be necessary. Because EDS, kyphoscoliosis type is associated with fragile skin with abnormal wound healing, affected people, especially children, may need to wear protective bandages or pads over exposed areas, such as the knees, shins, and forehead. Regular follow-up may be recommended to check for development or progression of abnormalities of the eyes, cardiovascular system, and other parts of the body.
