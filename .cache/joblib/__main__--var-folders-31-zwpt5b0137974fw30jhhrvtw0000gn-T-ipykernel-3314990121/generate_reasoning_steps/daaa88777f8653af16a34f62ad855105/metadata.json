In between them are soft disks filled with a jelly-like substance. These disks cushion the vertebrae and keep them in place. As you age, the disks break down or degenerate. As they do, they lose their cushioning ability. This can lead to pain if the back is stressed.    A herniated disk is a disk that ruptures. This allows the jelly-like center of the disk to leak, irritating the nearby nerves. This can cause sciatica or back pain.    Your doctor will diagnose a herniated disk with a physical exam and, sometimes, imaging tests. With treatment, most people recover. Treatments include rest, pain and anti-inflammatory medicines, physical therapy, and sometimes surgery.    NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Each time your heart beats, it pumps blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is highest when your heart beats, pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest, between beats, your blood pressure falls. This is called diastolic pressure.     Your blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually the systolic number comes before or above the diastolic number. A reading of       - 119/79 or lower is normal blood pressure    - 140/90 or higher is high blood pressure    - Between 120 and 139 for the top number, or between 80 and 89 for the bottom number is called prehypertension. Prehypertension means you may end up with high blood pressure, unless you take steps to prevent it.       High blood pressure usually has no symptoms, but it can cause serious problems such as stroke, heart failure, heart attack and kidney failure.    You can control high blood pressure through healthy lifestyle habits such as exercise and the DASH diet and taking medicines, if needed.     NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', \"Edema means swelling caused by fluid in your body's tissues. It usually occurs in the feet, ankles and legs, but it can involve your entire body.    Causes of edema include       - Eating too much salt    - Sunburn    - Heart failure    - Kidney disease    - Liver problems from cirrhosis    - Pregnancy    - Problems with lymph nodes, especially after mastectomy    - Some medicines    - Standing or walking a lot when the weather is warm       To keep swelling down, your health care provider may recommend keeping your legs raised when sitting, wearing support stockings, limiting how much salt you eat, or taking a medicine called a diuretic - also called a water pill.\", 'Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic skin disease. It can occur in one or multiple areas of your body. HS usually develops in your armpits, groin, and anal area. It causes long-term skin inflammation and can be painful.     Symptoms include        - Blackheads and red, tender bumps, called abscesses. The abscesses get bigger, break open, and leak pus    - Tunnels that form under the skin between abscesses    - Scarring       No one knows what causes HS. It is more common in women, African Americans, and people who have had acne. It usually starts after the teenage years. Treatments include antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medicines, and sometimes surgery. Losing weight or wearing looser clothing may help some patients avoid skin irritation.']}"}, "time": 1746283466.980683}
