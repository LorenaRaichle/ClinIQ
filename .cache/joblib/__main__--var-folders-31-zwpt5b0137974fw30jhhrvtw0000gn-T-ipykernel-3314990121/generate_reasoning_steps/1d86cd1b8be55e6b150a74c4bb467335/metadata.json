Chronic DIC develops more slowly (over weeks or months). It lasts longer and usually isn't recognized as quickly as acute DIC.\\n                \\nWith acute DIC, blood clotting in the blood vessels usually occurs first, followed by bleeding. However, bleeding may be the first obvious sign. Serious bleeding can occur very quickly after developing acute DIC. Thus, emergency treatment in a hospital is needed.\\n                \\nBlood clotting also occurs with chronic DIC, but it usually doesn't lead to bleeding. Sometimes chronic DIC has no signs or symptoms.\\n                \\nSigns and Symptoms of Excessive Blood Clotting\\n                \\nIn DIC, blood clots form throughout the body's small blood vessels. These blood clots can reduce or block blood flow through the blood vessels. This can cause the following signs and symptoms:\\n                \\nChest pain and shortness of breath if blood clots form in the blood vessels in your lungs and heart.\\n                \\nPain, redness, warmth, and swelling in the lower leg if blood clots form in the deep veins of your leg.\\n                \\nHeadaches, speech changes, paralysis (an inability to move), dizziness, and trouble speaking and understanding if blood clots form in the blood vessels in your brain. These signs and symptoms may indicate a stroke.\\n                \\nHeart attack and lung and kidney problems if blood clots lodge in your heart, lungs, or kidneys. These organs may even begin to fail.\\n                \\nSigns and Symptoms of Bleeding\\n                \\nIn DIC, the increased clotting activity uses up the platelets and clotting factors in the blood. As a result, serious bleeding can occur. DIC can cause internal and external bleeding.\\n                \\nInternal Bleeding\\n                \\nInternal bleeding can occur in your body's organs, such as the kidneys, intestines, and brain. This bleeding can be life threatening. Signs and symptoms of internal bleeding include:\\n                \\nBlood in your urine from bleeding in your kidneys or bladder.\\n                \\nBlood in your stools from bleeding in your intestines or stomach. Blood in your stools can appear red or as a dark, tarry color. (Taking iron supplements also can cause dark, tarry stools.)\\n                \\nHeadaches, double vision, seizures, and other symptoms from bleeding in your brain.\\n                \\nExternal Bleeding\\n                \\nExternal bleeding can occur underneath or from the skin, such as at the site of cuts or an intravenous (IV) needle. External bleeding also can occur from the mucosa. (The mucosa is the tissue that lines some organs and body cavities, such as your nose and mouth.)\\n                \\nExternal bleeding may cause purpura (PURR-purr-ah) or petechiae (peh-TEE-key-ay). Purpura are purple, brown, and red bruises. This bruising may happen easily and often. Petechiae are small red or purple dots on your skin.\\n                \\nPurpura and Petechiae\\n                \\n\\n                \\nOther signs of external bleeding include:\\n                \\nProlonged bleeding, even from minor cuts.\\n                \\nBleeding or oozing from your gums or nose, especially nosebleeds or bleeding from brushing your teeth.\\n                \\nHeavy or extended menstrual bleeding in women.\", 'Your doctor will diagnose disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. Your doctor also will look for the cause of DIC.\\n                \\nAcute DIC requires emergency treatment. The condition can be life threatening if it\\'s not treated right away. If you have signs or symptoms of severe bleeding or blood clots, call 911 right away.\\n                \\nMedical History and Physical Exam\\n                \\nYour doctor will ask whether you have or have had any diseases or conditions that can trigger DIC. For more information about these diseases and conditions, go to \"What Causes Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation?\"\\n                \\nYour doctor will ask about signs and symptoms of blood clots and bleeding. He or she also will do a physical exam to look for signs and symptoms of blood clots and internal and external bleeding. For example, your doctor may look for bleeding from your gums.\\n                \\nDiagnostic Tests\\n                \\nTo diagnose DIC, your doctor may recommend blood tests to look at your blood cells and the clotting process. For these tests, a small amount of blood is drawn from a blood vessel, usually in your arm.\\n                \\nComplete Blood Count and Blood Smear\\n                \\nA complete blood count (CBC) measures the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood.\\n                \\nPlatelets are blood cell fragments that help with blood clotting. Abnormal platelet numbers may be a sign of a bleeding disorder (not enough clotting) or a thrombotic disorder (too much clotting).\\n                \\nA blood smear is a test that may reveal whether your red blood cells are damaged.\\n                \\nTests for Clotting Factors and Clotting Time\\n                \\nThe following tests examine the proteins active in the blood clotting process and how long it takes them to form a blood clot.\\n                \\nPT and PTT tests. These tests measure how long it takes blood clots to form.\\n                \\nSerum fibrinogen. Fibrinogen is a protein that helps the blood clot. This test measures how much fibrinogen is in your blood.\\n                \\nFibrin degradation. After blood clots dissolve, substances called fibrin degradation products are left behind in the blood. This test measures the amount of these substances in the blood.', 'Treatment for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) depends on its severity and cause. The main goals of treating DIC are to control bleeding and clotting problems and treat the underlying cause.\\n                \\nAcute Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation\\n                \\nPeople who have acute DIC may have severe bleeding that requires emergency treatment in a hospital. Treatment may include blood transfusions, medicines, and oxygen therapy. (Oxygen is given through nasal prongs, a mask, or a breathing tube.)\\n                \\nA blood transfusion is a safe, common procedure. You receive blood through an intravenous (IV) line in one of your blood vessels. Blood transfusions are done to replace blood loss due to an injury, surgery, or illness.\\n                \\nBlood is made up of various parts, including red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and plasma. Some blood transfusions involve whole blood (blood with all of its parts). More often though, only some parts of blood are transfused.\\n                \\nIf you have DIC, you may be given platelets and clotting factors, red blood cells, and plasma (the liquid part of blood).\\n                \\nChronic Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation\\n                \\nPeople who have chronic DIC are more likely to have blood clotting problems than bleeding. If you have chronic DIC, your doctor may treat you with medicines called anticoagulants, or blood thinners.\\n                \\nBlood thinners help prevent blood clots from forming. They also keep existing blood clots from getting larger.', 'A cough is a natural reflex that protects your lungs. Coughing helps clear your airways of lung irritants, such as smoke and mucus (a slimy substance). This helps prevent infections. A cough also can be a symptom of a medical problem.\\n                \\nProlonged coughing can cause unpleasant side effects, such as chest pain, exhaustion, light-headedness, and loss of bladder control. Coughing also can interfere with sleep, socializing, and work.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nCoughing occurs when the nerve endings in your airways become irritated. The airways are tubes that carry air into and out of your lungs. Certain substances (such as smoke and pollen), medical conditions, and medicines can irritate these nerve endings.\\n                \\nA cough can be acute, subacute, or chronic, depending on how long it lasts.\\n                \\nAn acute cough lasts less than 3 weeks. Common causes of an acute cough are a common cold or other upper respiratory (RES-pi-rah-tor-e) infections. Examples of other upper respiratory infections include the flu, pneumonia (nu-MO-ne-ah), and whooping cough.\\n                \\nA subacute cough lasts 3 to 8 weeks. This type of cough remains even after a cold or other respiratory infection is over.\\n                \\nA chronic cough lasts more than 8 weeks. Common causes of a chronic cough are upper airway cough syndrome (UACS); asthma; and gastroesophageal (GAS-tro-eh-so-fa-JE-al) reflux disease, or GERD.\\n                \\n\"UACS\" is a term used to describe conditions that inflame the upper airways and cause a cough. Examples include sinus infections and allergies. These conditions can cause mucus to run down your throat from the back of your nose. This is called postnasal drip.\\n                \\nAsthma is a long-term lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways. GERD occurs if acid from your stomach backs up into your throat.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nThe best way to treat a cough is to treat its cause. For example, asthma is treated with medicines that open the airways.\\n                \\nYour doctor may recommend cough medicine if the cause of your cough is unknown and the cough causes a lot of discomfort. Cough medicines may harm children. If your child has a cough, talk with his or her doctor about how to treat it.']}"}, "time": 1746283466.468543}
