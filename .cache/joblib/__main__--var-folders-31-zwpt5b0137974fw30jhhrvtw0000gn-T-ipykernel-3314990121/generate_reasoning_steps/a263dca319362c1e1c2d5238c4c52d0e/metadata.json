It most often affects people of Northern European descent. The other types of hemochromatosis are considered rare and have been studied in only a small number of families worldwide.', 'Mutations in the HAMP, HFE, HFE2, SLC40A1, and TFR2 genes cause hereditary hemochromatosis. Type 1 hemochromatosis results from mutations in the HFE gene, and type 2 hemochromatosis results from mutations in either the HFE2 or HAMP gene. Mutations in the TFR2 gene cause type 3 hemochromatosis, and mutations in the SLC40A1 gene cause type 4 hemochromatosis.  The proteins produced from these genes play important roles in regulating the absorption, transport, and storage of iron. Mutations in any of these genes impair the control of iron absorption during digestion and alter the distribution of iron to other parts of the body. As a result, iron accumulates in tissues and organs, which can disrupt their normal functions.', 'Types 1, 2, and 3 hemochromatosis are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene but do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.  Type 4 hemochromatosis is distinguished by its autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. With this type of inheritance, one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition.', 'These resources address the diagnosis or management of hereditary hemochromatosis:  - Gene Review: Gene Review: HFE-Associated Hereditary Hemochromatosis  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Juvenile Hereditary Hemochromatosis  - Gene Review: Gene Review: TFR2-Related Hereditary Hemochromatosis  - GeneFacts: Hereditary Hemochromatosis: Diagnosis  - GeneFacts: Hereditary Hemochromatosis: Management  - Genetic Testing Registry: Hemochromatosis type 1  - Genetic Testing Registry: Hemochromatosis type 2A  - Genetic Testing Registry: Hemochromatosis type 3  - Genetic Testing Registry: Hemochromatosis type 4  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Hemochromatosis   These resources from MedlinePlus offer information about the diagnosis and management of various health conditions:  - Diagnostic Tests  - Drug Therapy  - Surgery and Rehabilitation  - Genetic Counseling   - Palliative Care']}"}, "time": 1746283449.929811}
