But if you have problems with your bite or the spacing of your teeth, you may need orthodontic care. Orthodontia is the branch of dentistry that deals with abnormalities of the teeth and jaw.    Orthodontic care involves the use of devices, such as braces, to       -  Straighten teeth    -  Correct problems with bite    -  Close gaps between teeth    -  Align lips and teeth properly        Most people who receive orthodontic care are kids, but adults get braces, too. In young children, orthodontic treatment may guide proper jaw growth. This can help permanent teeth to come in properly. Straight permanent teeth can help prevent tooth problems later on.', \"The ovaries are part of the female reproductive system. They produce a woman's eggs and female hormones. Each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond.    Cancer of the ovary is not common, but it causes more deaths than other female reproductive cancers. The sooner ovarian cancer is found and treated, the better your chance for recovery. But ovarian cancer is hard to detect early. Women with ovarian cancer may have no symptoms or just mild symptoms until the disease is in an advanced stage. Then it is hard to treat. Symptoms may include       - A heavy feeling in the pelvis    - Pain in the lower abdomen    -  Bleeding from the vagina    -  Weight gain or loss    -  Abnormal periods    -  Unexplained back pain that gets worse    -  Gas, nausea, vomiting, or loss of appetite       To diagnose ovarian cancer, doctors do one or more tests. They include a physical exam, a pelvic exam, lab tests, ultrasound, or a biopsy. Treatment is usually surgery followed by chemotherapy.    NIH: National Cancer Institute\", \"Bone marrow is the spongy tissue inside some of your bones, such as your hip and thigh bones. It contains stem cells. The stem cells can develop into the red blood cells that carry oxygen through your body, the white blood cells that fight infections, and the platelets that help with blood clotting.    With bone marrow disease, there are problems with the stem cells or how they develop:       - In leukemia, a cancer of the blood, the bone marrow makes abnormal white blood cells    - In aplastic anemia, the bone marrow doesn't make red blood cells    - In myeloproliferative disorders, the bone marrow makes too many white blood cells    - Other diseases, such as lymphoma, can spread into the bone marrow and affect the production of blood cells       Causes of bone marrow diseases include genetics and environmental factors. Tests for bone marrow diseases include blood and bone marrow tests. Treatments depend on the disorder and how severe it is. They might involve medicines, blood transfusions or a bone marrow transplant.\", 'Summary : Occupational health problems occur at work or because of the kind of work you do.
