The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Sturge-Weber syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Seizures 90% Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 50% Cerebral ischemia 50% Cognitive impairment 50% Glaucoma 50% Hyperreflexia 50% Optic atrophy 50% Abnormality of the retinal vasculature 7.5% Arnold-Chiari malformation 7.5% Autism 7.5% Cerebral calcification 7.5% Cerebral cortical atrophy 7.5% Choroideremia 7.5% Conjunctival telangiectasia 7.5% Corneal dystrophy 7.5% Feeding difficulties in infancy 7.5% Gingival overgrowth 7.5% Hearing abnormality 7.5% Heterochromia iridis 7.5% Hydrocephalus 7.5% Iris coloboma 7.5% Macrocephaly 7.5% Neurological speech impairment 7.5% Retinal detachment 7.5% Visual impairment 7.5% Arachnoid hemangiomatosis - Buphthalmos - Choroidal hemangioma - Facial hemangioma - Intellectual disability - Sporadic - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are some of the benefits and risks of laser treatment for port-wine stains associated with Sturge-Weber syndrome? Pulsed dye laser (PDL) remains the treatment of choice for the majority of children with a port-wine stain (PWS). Laser treatment of port-wine stains may produce good cosmetic results, with a low incidence of adverse skin changes and other side effects. A major benefit of laser treatment for a PWS is that it can help to minimize psychological problems associated with the social consequences of having a PWS. It has been shown that large facial port-wine stains are associated with an increase in mood and social problems in children older than 10 years of age.Most experts agree that there is little risk associated with the use of PDL in a child with Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS), provided that anticonvulsant therapy is maintained and that adequate care is taken. The level of pain associated with laser treatment varies. Management of anesthesia should be carefully planned to minimize the potential for secondary effects. Few children with SWS achieve complete clearance of their PWS with laser treatment; PDL does have limitations when large areas or dermatomal patterns are involved.', 'Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 2 (PFIC2) is a rare condition that affects the liver. People with this condition generally develop signs and symptoms during infancy, which may include severe itching, jaundice, failure to thrive, portal hypertension (high blood pressure in the vein that provides blood to the liver) and hepatosplenomegaly (enlarged liver and spleen). PFIC2 generally progresses to liver failure in the first few years of life. Affected people also have an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (a form of liver cancer). PFIC2 is caused by change (mutations) in the ABCB11 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment may include ursodeoxycholic acid therapy to prevent liver damage, surgery and/or liver transplantation.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 2?
