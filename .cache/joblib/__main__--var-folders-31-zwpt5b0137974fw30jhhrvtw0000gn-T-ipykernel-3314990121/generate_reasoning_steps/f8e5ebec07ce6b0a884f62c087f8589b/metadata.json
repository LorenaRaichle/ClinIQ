The goals of treatment include:\\n                \\nLowering the risk of blood clots forming\\n                \\nPreventing atherosclerosis-related diseases\\n                \\nReducing risk factors in an effort to slow or stop the buildup of plaque\\n                \\nRelieving symptoms\\n                \\nWidening or bypassing plaque-clogged arteries\\n                \\nHeart-Healthy Lifestyle Changes\\n                \\nYour doctor may recommend heart-healthy lifestyle changes if you have atherosclerosis. Heart-healthy lifestyle changes include heart-healthy eating, maintaining a healthy weight, managing stress, physical activity and quitting smoking.\\n                \\nHeart-Healthy Eating\\n                \\nYour doctor may recommend heart-healthy eating, which should include:\\n                \\nFat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk\\n                \\nFish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week\\n                \\nFruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes\\n                \\nLegumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans\\n                \\nVegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots\\n                \\nWhole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas\\n                \\nWhen following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating:\\n                \\nA lot of red meat\\n                \\nPalm and coconut oils\\n                \\nSugary foods and beverages\\n                \\nTwo nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise:\\n                \\nSaturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals\\n                \\nTrans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats and meats.\\n                \\nSaturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5 percent to 6 percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples:\\n                \\n1,200 calories a day\\n                \\n8 grams of saturated fat a day\\n                \\n1,500 calories a day\\n                \\n10 grams of saturated fat a day\\n                \\n1,800 calories a day\\n                \\n12 grams of saturated fat a day\\n                \\n2,000 calories a day\\n                \\n13 grams of saturated fat a day\\n                \\n2,500 calories a day\\n                \\n17 grams of saturated fat a day\\n                \\nNot all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterol levels. Some sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are:\\n                \\nAvocados\\n                \\nCorn, sunflower, and soybean oils\\n                \\nNuts and seeds, such as walnuts\\n                \\nOlive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils\\n                \\nPeanut butter\\n                \\nSalmon and trout\\n                \\nTofu\\n                \\nSodium\\n                \\nYou should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.\\n                \\nDietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension\\n                \\nYour doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt.\\n                \\nThe DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH.\\n                \\nAlcohol\\n                \\nTry to limit alcohol intake. Too much alcohol will raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain.\\n                \\nMen should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is:\\n                \\n12 ounces of beer\\n                \\n5 ounces of wine\\n                \\n1 ounces of liquor\\n                \\nMaintaining a Healthy Weight\\n                \\nMaintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for coronary heart disease. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active.\\n                \\nKnowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI:\\n                \\nBelow 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.\\n                \\nBetween 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range.\\n                \\nBetween 25.0 and 29.9 is considered overweight.\\n                \\nA BMI of 30.0 or higher is considered obese.\\n                \\nA general goal to aim for is a BMI of less than 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal.\\n                \\nMeasuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type2 diabetes. This risk may be high with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk. For more information about losing weight or maintaining your weight, visit Aim for a Healthy Weight.\\n                \\nIf youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol.\\n                \\nManaging Stress\\n                \\nLearning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as:\\n                \\nA stress management program\\n                \\nMeditation\\n                \\nPhysical activity\\n                \\nRelaxation therapy\\n                \\nTalking things out with friends or family\\n                \\nPhysical Activity\\n                \\nRegular physical activity can lower many atherosclerosis risk factors, including LDL or bad cholesterol, high blood pressure, and excess weight. Physical activity also can lower your risk for diabetes and raise your HDL or good cholesterol, which helps prevent atherosclerosis.\\n                \\nEveryone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2 hours and 30 minutes per week or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1 hour and 15 minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10minutes at a time spread throughout the week.\\n                \\nTalk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you. Read more about physical activity at:\\n                \\nPhysical Activity and Your Heart\\n                \\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans\\n                \\nQuitting Smoking\\n                \\nIf you smoke or use tobacco, quit. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels and raise your risk for atherosclerosis. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.\\n                \\nFor more information about how to quit smoking, visit Smoking and Your Heart.\\n                \\nMedicines\\n                \\nSometimes lifestyle changes alone arent enough to control your cholesterol levels. For example, you also may need statin medications to control or lower your cholesterol. By lowering your blood cholesterol level, you can decrease your chance of having a heart attack or stroke. Doctors usually prescribe statins for people who have:\\n                \\nCoronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, or had a prior stroke\\n                \\nDiabetes\\n                \\nHigh LDL cholesterol levels\\n                \\nDoctors may discuss beginning statin treatment with people who have an elevated risk for developing heart disease or having a stroke. Your doctor also may prescribe other medications to:\\n                \\nLower your blood pressure\\n                \\nLower your blood sugar levels\\n                \\nPrevent blood clots, which can lead to heart attack and stroke\\n                \\nPrevent inflammation\\n                \\nTake all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to. You should still follow a heart healthy lifestyle, even if you take medicines to treat your atherosclerosis.\\n                \\nMedical Procedures and Surgery\\n                \\nIf you have severe atherosclerosis, your doctor may recommend a medical procedure or surgery.\\n                \\nPercutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), also known as coronary angioplasty, is a procedure thats used to open blocked or narrowed coronary (heart) arteries. PCI can improve blood flow to the heart and relieve chest pain. Sometimes a small mesh tube called a stent is placed in the artery to keep it open after the procedure.\\n                \\nCoronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a type of surgery. In CABG, arteries or veins from other areas in your body are used to bypass or go around your narrowed coronary arteries. CABG can improve blood flow to your heart, relieve chest pain, and possibly prevent a heart attack.\\n                \\nBypass grafting also can be used for leg arteries. For this surgery, a healthy blood vessel is used to bypass a narrowed or blocked artery in one of the legs. The healthy blood vessel redirects blood around the blocked artery, improving blood flow to the leg.\\n                \\nCarotid endarterectomy is a type of surgery to remove plaque buildup from the carotid arteries in the neck. This procedure restores blood flow to the brain, which can help prevent a stroke.', 'Taking action to control your risk factors can help prevent or delay atherosclerosis and its related diseases. Your risk for atherosclerosis increases with the number of risk factors youhave.\\n                \\nOne step you can take is to adopt a healthy lifestyle, which can include:\\n                \\nHeart-Healthy Eating. Adopt heart-healthy eating habits, which include eating different fruits and vegetables (including beans and peas), whole grains, lean meats, poultry without skin, seafood, and fat-free or low-fat milk and dairy products. A heart-healthy diet is low in sodium, added sugar, solid fats, and refined grains. Following a heart-healthy diet is an important part of a healthy lifestyle.\\n                \\nPhysical Activity. Be as physically active as you can. Physical activity can improve your fitness level and your health. Ask your doctor what types and amounts of activity are safe for you. Read more about Physical Activity and Your Heart.\\n                \\nQuit Smoking. If you smoke, quit. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels and raise your risk for atherosclerosis. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. Read more about Smoking and Your Heart.\\n                \\nWeight Control. If youre overweight or obese, work with your doctor to create a reasonable weight-loss plan. Controlling your weight helps you control risk factors foratherosclerosis.\\n                \\nOther steps that can prevent or delay atherosclerosis include knowing your family history of atherosclerosis. If you or someone in your family has an atherosclerosis-related disease, be sure to tell your doctor.\\n                \\nIf lifestyle changes arent enough, your doctor may prescribe medicines to control your atherosclerosis risk factors. Take all of your medicines as your doctor advises.', \"Espaol\\n                \\nAngina (an-JI-nuh or AN-juh-nuh) is chest pain or discomfort that occurs if an area of your heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood.\\n                \\nAngina may feel like pressure or squeezing in your chest. The pain also can occur in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. Angina pain may even feel like indigestion.\\n                \\nAngina isn't a disease; it's a symptom of an underlying heart problem. Angina usually is a symptom of coronary heart disease (CHD).\\n                \\nCHD is the most common type of heart disease in adults. It occurs if a waxy substance called plaque (plak) builds up on the inner walls of your coronary arteries. These arteries carry oxygen-rich blood to your heart.\\n                \\nPlaque Buildup in an Artery\\n                \\n\\n                \\nPlaque narrows and stiffens the coronary arteries. This reduces the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle, causing chest pain. Plaque buildup also makes it more likely that blood clots will form in your arteries. Blood clots can partially or completely block blood flow, which can cause a heart attack.\\n                \\nAngina also can be a symptom of coronary microvascular disease (MVD). This is heart disease that affects the hearts smallest coronary arteries. In coronary MVD, plaque doesn't create blockages in the arteries like it does in CHD.\\n                \\nStudies have shown that coronary MVD is more likely to affect women than men. Coronary MVD also is called cardiac syndrome X and nonobstructive CHD.\\n                \\nTypes of Angina\\n                \\nThe major types of angina are stable, unstable, variant (Prinzmetal's), and microvascular. Knowing how the types differ is important. This is because they have different symptoms and require different treatments.\\n                \\nStable Angina\\n                \\nStable angina is the most common type of angina. It occurs when the heart is working harder than usual. Stable angina has a regular pattern. (Pattern refers to how often the angina occurs, how severe it is, and what factors trigger it.)\\n                \\nIf you have stable angina, you can learn its pattern and predict when the pain will occur. The pain usually goes away a few minutes after you rest or take your angina medicine.\\n                \\nStable angina isn't a heart attack, but it suggests that a heart attack is more likely to happen in the future.\\n                \\nUnstable Angina\\n                \\nUnstable angina doesn't follow a pattern. It may occur more often and be more severe than stable angina. Unstable angina also can occur with or without physical exertion, and rest or medicine may not relieve the pain.\\n                \\nUnstable angina is very dangerous and requires emergency treatment. This type of angina is a sign that a heart attack may happen soon.\\n                \\nVariant (Prinzmetal's) Angina\\n                \\nVariant angina is rare. A spasm in a coronary artery causes this type of angina. Variant angina usually occurs while you're at rest, and the pain can be severe. It usually happens between midnight and early morning. Medicine can relieve this type of angina.\\n                \\nMicrovascular Angina\\n                \\nMicrovascular angina can be more severe and last longer than other types of angina. Medicine may not relieve this type of angina.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nExperts believe that nearly 7 million people in the United States suffer from angina. The condition occurs equally among men and women.\\n                \\nAngina can be a sign of CHD, even if initial tests don't point to the disease. However, not all chest pain or discomfort is a sign of CHD.\\n                \\nOther conditions also can cause chest pain, such as:\\n                \\nPulmonary embolism (a blockage in a lung artery)\\n                \\nA lung infection\\n                \\nAortic dissection (tearing of a major artery)\\n                \\nAortic stenosis (narrowing of the hearts aortic valve)\\n                \\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (KAR-de-o-mi-OP-ah-thee; heart muscle disease)\\n                \\nPericarditis (inflammation in the tissues that surround the heart)\\n                \\nA panic attack\\n                \\nAll chest pain should be checked by a doctor.\", 'Underlying Causes\\n                \\nAngina usually is a symptom of coronary heart disease (CHD). This means that the underlying causes of angina generally are the same as the underlying causes of CHD.\\n                \\nResearch suggests that CHD starts when certain factors damage the inner layers of the coronary arteries. These factors include:\\n                \\nSmoking\\n                \\nHigh amounts of certain fats and cholesterol in the blood\\n                \\nHigh blood pressure\\n                \\nHigh amounts of sugar in the blood due to insulin resistance or diabetes\\n                \\nPlaque may begin to build up where the arteries are damaged. When plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis (ath-er-o-skler-O-sis).\\n                \\nPlaque narrows or blocks the arteries, reducing blood flow to the heart muscle. Some plaque is hard and stable and causes the arteries to become narrow and stiff. This can greatly reduce blood flow to the heart and cause angina.\\n                \\nOther plaque is soft and more likely to rupture (break open) and cause blood clots. Blood clots can partially or totally block the coronary arteries and cause angina or a heart attack.\\n                \\nImmediate Causes\\n                \\nMany factors can trigger angina pain, depending on the type of angina you have.\\n                \\nStable Angina\\n                \\nPhysical exertion is the most common trigger of stable angina. Severely narrowed arteries may allow enough blood to reach the heart when the demand for oxygen is low, such as when you\\'re sitting.\\n                \\nHowever, with physical exertionlike walking up a hill or climbing stairsthe heart works harder and needs more oxygen.\\n                \\nOther triggers of stable angina include:\\n                \\nEmotional stress\\n                \\nExposure to very hot or cold temperatures\\n                \\nHeavy meals\\n                \\nSmoking\\n                \\nUnstable Angina\\n                \\nBlood clots that partially or totally block an artery cause unstable angina.\\n                \\nIf plaque in an artery ruptures, blood clots may form. This creates a blockage. A clot may grow large enough to completely block the artery and cause a heart attack. For more information, go to the animation in \"What Causes a Heart Attack?\"\\n                \\nBlood clots may form, partially dissolve, and later form again. Angina can occur each time a clot blocks an artery.\\n                \\nVariant Angina\\n                \\nA spasm in a coronary artery causes variant angina. The spasm causes the walls of the artery to tighten and narrow. Blood flow to the heart slows or stops. Variant angina can occur in people who have CHD and in those who dont.\\n                \\nThe coronary arteries can spasm as a result of:\\n                \\nExposure to cold\\n                \\nEmotional stress\\n                \\nMedicines that tighten or narrow blood vessels\\n                \\nSmoking\\n                \\nCocaine use\\n                \\nMicrovascular Angina\\n                \\nThis type of angina may be a symptom of coronary microvascular disease (MVD). Coronary MVD is heart disease that affects the hearts smallest coronary arteries.\\n                \\nReduced blood flow in the small coronary arteries may cause microvascular angina. Plaque in the arteries, artery spasms, or damaged or diseased artery walls can reduce blood flow through the small coronary arteries.']}"}, "time": 1746283465.448261}
