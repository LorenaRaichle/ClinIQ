Do you wake up feeling tired or feel very sleepy during the day, even if you have had enough sleep? You might have a sleep disorder. The most common kinds are       - Insomnia - a hard time falling or staying asleep    - Sleep apnea - breathing interruptions during sleep    -  Restless legs syndrome - a tingling or prickly sensation in the legs     - Narcolepsy - daytime \"sleep attacks\"       Nightmares, night terrors, sleepwalking, sleep talking, head banging, wetting the bed and grinding your teeth are kinds of sleep problems called parasomnias. There are treatments for most sleep disorders. Sometimes just having regular sleep habits can help.', \"Snoring is the sound you make when your breathing is blocked while you are asleep. The sound is caused by tissues at the top of your airway that strike each other and vibrate. Snoring is common, especially among older people and people who are overweight.    When severe, snoring can cause frequent awakenings at night and daytime sleepiness. It can disrupt your bed partner's sleep. Snoring can also be a sign of a serious sleep disorder called sleep apnea. You should see your health care provider if you are often tired during the day, don't feel that you sleep well, or wake up gasping.    To reduce snoring       - Lose weight if you are overweight. It may help, but thin people can snore, too.    - Cut down or avoid alcohol and other sedatives at bedtime    - Don't sleep flat on your back       NIH: National Institute on Aging\", 'Summary : Your skin changes as you age. You might notice wrinkles, age spots and dryness. Your skin also becomes thinner and loses fat, making it less plump and smooth. It might take longer to heal, too.     Sunlight is a major cause of skin aging. You can protect yourself by staying out of the sun when it is strongest, using sunscreen with an SPF of 15 or higher, wearing protective clothing, and avoiding sunlamps and tanning beds. Cigarette smoking also contributes to wrinkles. The wrinkling increases with the amount of cigarettes and number of years a person has smoked.    Many products claim to revitalize aging skin or reduce wrinkles, but the Food and Drug Administration has approved only a few for sun-damaged or aging skin. Various treatments soothe dry skin and reduce the appearance of age spots.    NIH: National Institute on Aging', 'Wild animals usually avoid people. They might attack, however, if they feel threatened, are sick, or are protecting their young or territory. Attacks by pets are more common. Animal bites rarely are life-threatening, but if they become infected, you can develop serious medical problems.     To prevent animal bites and complications from bites       -  Never pet, handle, or feed unknown animals     -  Leave snakes alone    -  Watch your children closely around animals    -  Vaccinate your cats, ferrets, and dogs against rabies    -  Spay or neuter your dog to make it less aggressive    -  Get a tetanus booster if you have not had one recently    -  Wear boots and long pants when you are in areas with venomous snakes       If an animal bites you, clean the wound with soap and water as soon as possible. Get medical attention if necessary.    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention']}"}, "time": 1746283466.858046}
