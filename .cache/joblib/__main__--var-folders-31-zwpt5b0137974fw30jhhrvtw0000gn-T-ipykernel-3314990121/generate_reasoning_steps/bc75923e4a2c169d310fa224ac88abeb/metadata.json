More than 60 million people in the U.S. have the parasite. Most of them don't get sick. But the parasite causes serious problems for some people. These include people with weak immune systems and babies whose mothers become infected for the first time during pregnancy. Problems can include damage to the brain, eyes, and other organs.    You can get toxoplasmosis from        -  Waste from an infected cat    -  Eating contaminated meat that is raw or not well cooked     -  Using utensils or cutting boards after they've had contact with contaminated raw meat     -  Drinking infected water     -  Receiving an infected organ transplant or blood transfusion       Most people with toxoplasmosis don't need treatment. There are drugs to treat it for pregnant women and people with weak immune systems.     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\", 'Trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted disease caused by a parasite. You get it through sexual intercourse with an infected partner. Many people do not have any symptoms. If you do get symptoms, they usually happen within 5 to 28 days after being infected.    Symptoms in women include       - Yellow-green or gray discharge from the vagina    - Discomfort during sex    - Vaginal odor    - Painful urination    - Itching in or near the vagina       Most men do not have symptoms. If they do, they may have a whitish discharge from the penis and painful or difficult urination and ejaculation.    Lab tests can tell if you have the infection. Treatment is with antibiotics. If you are infected, you and your partner must be treated. Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading trichomoniasis.    NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases', 'Summary : Antidepressants are medicines that treat depression. Your doctor can prescribe them for you. They work to balance some of the natural chemicals in our brains. It may take several weeks for them to help. There are several types of antidepressants. You and your doctor may have to try a few before finding what works best for you.    Antidepressants may cause mild side effects that usually do not last long. These may include headache, nausea, sleep problems, restlessness, and sexual problems. Tell your doctor if you have any side effects. You should also let your doctor know if you take any other medicines, vitamins, or herbal supplements.    It is important to keep taking your medicines, even if you feel better. Do not stop taking your medicines without talking to your doctor. You often need to stop antidepressants gradually.    NIH: National Institute of Mental Health', \"Your pleura is a large, thin sheet of tissue that wraps around the outside of your lungs and lines the inside of your chest cavity. Between the layers of the pleura is a very thin space. Normally it's filled with a small amount of fluid. The fluid helps the two layers of the pleura glide smoothly past each other as your lungs breathe air in and out.    Disorders of the pleura include       - Pleurisy - inflammation of the pleura that causes sharp pain with breathing    - Pleural effusion - excess fluid in the pleural space    - Pneumothorax - buildup of air or gas in the pleural space    - Hemothorax - buildup of blood in the pleural space       Many different conditions can cause pleural problems. Viral infection is the most common cause of pleurisy. The most common cause of pleural effusion is congestive heart failure. Lung diseases, like COPD, tuberculosis, and acute lung injury, cause pneumothorax. Injury to the chest is the most common cause of hemothorax. Treatment focuses on removing fluid, air, or blood from the pleural space, relieving symptoms, and treating the underlying condition.
