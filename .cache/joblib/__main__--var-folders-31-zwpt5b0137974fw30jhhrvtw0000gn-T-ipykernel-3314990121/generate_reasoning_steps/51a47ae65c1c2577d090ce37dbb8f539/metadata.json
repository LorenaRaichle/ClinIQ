Salivary gland cancer is diagnosed in 2-3 individuals per 100,000 people each year, and 30-35% of these are mucoepidermoid carcinomas.   Mucoepidermoid carcinoma develops when a cell randomly acquires changes (mutations) in genes that regulate how the cell divides such that it begins to grow quickly, forming a cluster of cells (a mass or lump).  The earliest signs of a mucoepidermoid carcinoma may include a lump in the face, neck, or mouth; numbness, weakness, or pain in part of the face; or difficulty swallowing.  Treatment often begins with surgery to remove the entire tumor.  In some cases, radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy may be used after surgery to ensure that no cancer cells remain in the body.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Anal sphincter dysplasia? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Anal sphincter dysplasia. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal dominant inheritance - Chronic constipation - Encopresis - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Familial glucocorticoid deficiency? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Familial glucocorticoid deficiency. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Accelerated skeletal maturation - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Coma - Decreased circulating cortisol level - Failure to thrive - Hyperpigmentation of the skin - Increased circulating ACTH level - Recurrent hypoglycemia - Recurrent infections - Seizures - Tall stature - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition.

Consequently, people affected by the condition have high levels of arginine in the blood and may also experience episodes of hyperammonemia (an accumulation of ammonia in the blood). Although most affected people appear healthy at birth, features of arginase deficiency generally develop between ages one and three years. Signs and symptoms may include growth deficiency, spasticity (abnormal tensing of the muscles), developmental delay, loss of developmental milestones, intellectual disability, seizures, and microcephaly. Arginase deficiency is caused by changes (mutations) in the ARG1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Management is generally focused on lowering arginine levels and preventing hyperammonemia. This may be accomplished through restriction of dietary protein and use of certain medications (called nitrogen-scavenging drugs) under the supervision of a medical team with experience treating metabolic conditions.']}"}, "time": 1746283458.871808}
