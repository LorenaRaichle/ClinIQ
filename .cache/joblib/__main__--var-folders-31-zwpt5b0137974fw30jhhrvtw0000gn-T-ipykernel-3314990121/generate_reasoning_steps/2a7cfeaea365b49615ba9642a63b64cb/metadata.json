Diagnosis of multiple familial trichoepithelioma is made based upon the clinical symptoms in the patient, the patients family history, and the appearance of the trichoepithelioma cells under a microscope (histology). Multiple familial trichoepithelioma must be distinguished from basal cell carcinoma (cancerous tumor) and other rare genetic syndromes such as Cowden syndrome.', 'How might multiple familial trichoepithelioma be treated? Several therapies have been used to treat multiple trichoepitheliomas, with variable results.  A single trichoepithelioma may be treated with surgery.  Cryosurgery or laser surgery may be used to remove multiple trichoepitheliomas.  Imiquimod cream has also been used as a treatment for trichoepitheliomas, with some improvement in symptoms.  Other treatments have included dermabrasion, photodynamic therapy, and other medications.  However, in most cases, multiple trichoepitheliomas eventually regrow following treatment.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Maturity-onset diabetes of the young, type 8? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Maturity-onset diabetes of the young, type 8. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abdominal pain - Abnormality of exocrine pancreas physiology - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Maturity-onset diabetes of the young - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Ascher syndrome is a rare condition characterized by a combination of episodic edemea or swelling of the eyelids (blepharochalasia), double lip, and nontoxic thyroid enlargement (goiter). The underlying cause of this condition is unknown. Most cases are sporadic, but familial cases suggestive of autosomal dominant inheritance have also been reported. The condition is often undiagnosed due to its rarity. Treatment may include surgical excision of the double lip and/or surgery for eyelid edema.']}"}, "time": 1746283459.752637}
