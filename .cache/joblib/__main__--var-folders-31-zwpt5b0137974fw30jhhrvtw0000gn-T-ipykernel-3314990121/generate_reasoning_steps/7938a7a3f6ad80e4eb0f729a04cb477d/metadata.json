The condition is named after these excess B cells which look 'hairy' under a microscope. As the number of leukemia cells increases, fewer healthy white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets are produced. The underlying cause of this condition is unknown. While there is no cure, treatment can lead to remission which can last for years.\", 'Spastic paraplegia 11 is a form of hereditary spastic paraplegia. People with spastic paraplegia 11 experience progressive muscle stiffness and eventual paralysis of the lower limbs, as well as a range of other neurologic symptoms. The tissue connecting the left and right halves of the brain (corpus callosum) is abnormally thin in individuals with this condition. Spastic paraplegia 11 is caused by mutations in the SPG11 gene and is passed through families in an autosomal recessive fashion.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Spastic paraplegia 11? Signs and symptoms of spastic paraplegia 11, include: Spasticity (progressive muscle stiffness) Paraplegia (eventual paralysis of the lower limbs)   Numbness, tingling, or pain in the arms and legs Disturbance in the nerves used for muscle movement Intellectual disability Exaggerated reflexes of the lower limbs  Speech difficulties  Reduced bladder control  Muscle wasting  Less common features, include: Difficulty swallowing  High-arched feet  Scoliosis  Involuntary movements of the eyes Age at time of symptom onset varies from infancy to early adulthood, with onset in infancy to adolescence being most common. Learning disability may begin in childhood. Most people experience a decline in intellectual ability and an increase in muscle weakness and nerve abnormalities over time. As the condition progresses, some people require wheelchair assistance (often 10 to 20 years after symptom onset). The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Spastic paraplegia 11. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Keratoderma palmoplantar spastic paralysis?
