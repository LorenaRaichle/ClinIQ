There is no cure for DRPLA; treatment is generally symptomatic and supportive. Management of signs and symptoms may include:  Treatment of seizures with anti-epileptic drugs Treatment of psychiatric problems with appropriate psychotropic medications Adaptation of environment and care to the level of dementia Adaptation of educational programs for affected children.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Dykes Markes Harper syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Dykes Markes Harper syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Developmental regression 90% Gait disturbance 90% Hepatomegaly 90% Ichthyosis 90% Incoordination 90% Neurological speech impairment 90% Splenomegaly 90% Ataxia - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Dysarthria - Hepatosplenomegaly - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Periventricular heterotopia is a condition in which the nerve cells (neurons) do not migrate properly during the early development of the fetal brain from about the 6th week to the 24th week of pregnancy. Affected people typically develop recurrent seizures (epilepsy) beginning in mid-adolescence. Intelligence is generally normal; however, some affected people may have mild intellectual disability, including difficulty with reading and/or spelling. Less common signs and symptoms include microcephaly, developmental delay, recurrent infections, and blood vessel abnormalities. Some cases are caused by changes (mutations) in the FLNA gene and are inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. Others are caused by mutations in the ARFGEF2 gene and are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Rarely, periventricular heterotopia is associated with duplication of genetic material on chromosome 5. Treatment is generally focused on managing recurrent seizures with medications.']}"}, "time": 1746283456.82971}
