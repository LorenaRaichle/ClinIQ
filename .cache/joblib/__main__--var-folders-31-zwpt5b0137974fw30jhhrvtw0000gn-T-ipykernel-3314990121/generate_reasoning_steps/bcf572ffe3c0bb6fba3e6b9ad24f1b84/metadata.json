This tumor causes pancreatic cells to produce high levels of a hormone called vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). The signs and symptoms of a VIPoma include abdominal pain, flushing or redness of the face, nausea, watery diarrhea, weight loss, dehydration, and low blood potassium (hypokalemia). VIPomas are usually diagnosed in adults around age 50. The cause of VIPoma is unknown. Treatment may include intravenous (IV) fluids to correct dehydration, medications such as octreotide to help control diarrhea, and surgery to remove the tumor.', 'How might VIPoma be treated? Treatment for VIPoma may include intravenous (IV) fluids to correct dehydration, medications such as octreotide to help control diarrhea, and surgery to remove the tumor. If the tumor has spread (metastasized) to the liver or other tissues, treatment may involve chemotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, or hepatic artery embolization.', 'Leprechaunism is a congenital (present from birth) condition characterized by extreme insulin resistance, pre- and postnatal growth delays, characteristic facial features, skin abnormalities, muscular hypotrophy (reduced muscle mass) and enlarged external genitalia in both males and females. The condition is caused by mutations in the insulin receptor gene (INSR) gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Leprechaunism? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Leprechaunism. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal facial shape 90% Abnormality of the nasal alae 90% Abnormality of the palate 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Decreased body weight 90% Hearing abnormality 90% Hyperinsulinemia 90% Hypertelorism 90% Hypoglycemia 90% Intrauterine growth retardation 90% Long penis 90% Low-set, posteriorly rotated ears 90% Macrotia 90% Proptosis 90% Recurrent respiratory infections 90% Short stature 90% Skeletal muscle atrophy 90% Thick lower lip vermilion 90% Thickened nuchal skin fold 90% Type II diabetes mellitus 90% Abnormality of the liver 50% Delayed skeletal maturation 50% Depressed nasal bridge 50% Feeding difficulties in infancy 50% Female pseudohermaphroditism 50% Gynecomastia 50% Hypertrichosis 50% Lipoatrophy 50% Umbilical hernia 50% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the abdominal wall musculature 7.5% Cryptorchidism 7.5% Microcephaly 7.5% Abdominal distention - Abnormality of the abdominal wall - Acanthosis nigricans - Adipose tissue loss - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Cholestasis - Clitoromegaly - Elfin facies - Fasting hypoglycemia - Gingival overgrowth - Hepatic fibrosis - Hyperglycemia - Hyperkeratosis - Hypermelanotic macule - Large hands - Long foot - Low-set ears - Nail dysplasia - Ovarian cyst - Pancreatic islet-cell hyperplasia - Postnatal growth retardation - Postprandial hyperglycemia - Precocious puberty - Prominent nipples - Recurrent infections - Severe failure to thrive - Small face - Wide mouth - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.']}"}, "time": 1746283457.736214}
