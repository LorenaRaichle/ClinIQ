Treatment for lichen planus pigmentosus is generally symptomatic and may include: Topical (applied to the skin) corticosteroids Topical calcineurin inhibitors (medications that are typically used to treat eczema) Skin lightening agents Laser therapy', 'Cap myopathy is a disorder that primarily affects skeletal muscles, the muscles that the body uses for movement. People with cap myopathy have muscle weakness (myopathy) and poor muscle tone (hypotonia) throughout the body, but they are most severely affected in the muscles of the face, neck, and limbs. The muscle weakness, which begins at birth or during childhood, can worsen over time. The name cap myopathy comes from characteristic abnormal cap-like structures that can be seen in muscle cells when muscle tissue is viewed under a microscope. The severity of cap myopathy is related to the percentage of muscle cells that have these caps. Individuals in whom 70 to 75 percent of muscle cells have caps typically have severe breathing problems and may not survive childhood, while those in whom 10 to 30 percent of muscle cells have caps have milder symptoms and can live into adulthood. Cap myopathy can be caused by mutations in the in the ACTA1, TPM2, or TPM3 genes. This condition follows an autosomal dominant manner of inheritance, however, most cases are not inherited; they result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.', 'Stargardt disease is a genetic eye disorder that causes progressive vision loss. It affects the macula, an area of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision. Vision loss is due to abnormal accumulation of a fatty yellow pigment (lipofuscin) in the cells within the macula. People with Stargardt disease also have problems with night vision, and some have problems with color vision. The signs and symptoms of Stargardt disease typically appear in late childhood to early adulthood and worsen over time. It is most commonly caused by mutations in the ABCA4 gene and inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Rarely it may be caused by mutations in other genes and inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. There is currently no treatment, but various services and devices can help affected people carry out daily activities and maintain their independence.', \"What are the signs and symptoms of Stargardt disease? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Stargardt disease. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Bull's eye maculopathy 15/15 Autosomal recessive inheritance - Macular degeneration - Retinitis pigmentosa inversa - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283458.0190852}
