A correct diagnosis is important because people who have P.A.D. are at higher risk for coronary heart disease (CHD), heart attack, stroke, and transient ischemic attack (\"mini-stroke\"). If you have P.A.D., your doctor also may want to check for signs of these diseases and conditions.\\n                \\nSpecialists Involved\\n                \\nPrimary care doctors, such as internists and family doctors, may treat people who have mild P.A.D. For more advanced P.A.D., a vascular specialist may be involved. This is a doctor who specializes in treating blood vessel diseases and conditions.\\n                \\nA cardiologist also may be involved in treating people who have P.A.D. Cardiologists treat heart problems, such as CHD and heart attack, which often affect people who have P.A.D.\\n                \\nMedical and Family Histories\\n                \\nYour doctor may ask:\\n                \\nWhether you have any risk factors for P.A.D. For example, he or she may ask whether you smoke or have diabetes.\\n                \\nAbout your symptoms, including any symptoms that occur when walking, exercising, sitting, standing, or climbing.\\n                \\nAbout your diet.\\n                \\nAbout any medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines.\\n                \\nWhether anyone in your family has a history of heart or blood vessel diseases.\\n                \\nPhysical Exam\\n                \\nDuring the physical exam, your doctor will look for signs of P.A.D. He or she may check the blood flow in your legs or feet to see whether you have weak or absent pulses.\\n                \\nYour doctor also may check the pulses in your leg arteries for an abnormal whooshing sound called a bruit. He or she can hear this sound with a stethoscope. A bruit may be a warning sign of a narrowed or blocked artery.\\n                \\nYour doctor may compare blood pressure between your limbs to see whether the pressure is lower in the affected limb. He or she also may check for poor wound healing or any changes in your hair, skin, or nails that may be signs of P.A.D.\\n                \\nDiagnostic Tests\\n                \\nAnkle-Brachial Index\\n                \\nA simple test called an ankle-brachial index (ABI) often is used to diagnose P.A.D. The ABI compares blood pressure in your ankle to blood pressure in your arm. This test shows how well blood is flowing in your limbs.\\n                \\nABI can show whether P.A.D. is affecting your limbs, but it won\\'t show which blood vessels are narrowed or blocked.\\n                \\nA normal ABI result is 1.0 or greater (with a range of 0.90 to 1.30). The test takes about 10 to 15 minutes to measure both arms and both ankles. This test may be done yearly to see whether P.A.D. is getting worse.\\n                \\nAnkle-Brachial Index\\n                \\n\\n                \\nDoppler Ultrasound\\n                \\nA Doppler ultrasound looks at blood flow in the major arteries and veins in the limbs. During this test, a handheld device is placed on your body and passed back and forth over the affected area. A computer converts sound waves into a picture of blood flow in the arteries and veins.\\n                \\nThe results of this test can show whether a blood vessel is blocked. The results also can help show the severity of P.A.D.\\n                \\nTreadmill Test\\n                \\nA treadmill test can show the severity of symptoms and the level of exercise that brings them on. You\\'ll walk on a treadmill for this test. This shows whether you have any problems during normal walking.\\n                \\nYou may have an ABI test before and after the treadmill test. This will help compare blood flow in your arms and legs before and after exercise.\\n                \\nMagnetic Resonance Angiogram\\n                \\nA magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) uses magnetic and radio wave energy to take pictures of your blood vessels. This test is a type of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\\n                \\nAn MRA can show the location and severity of a blocked blood vessel. If you have a pacemaker, man-made joint, stent, surgical clips, mechanical heart valve, or other metallic devices in your body, you might not be able to have an MRA. Ask your doctor whether an MRA is an option for you.\\n                \\nArteriogram\\n                \\nAn arteriogram provides a \"road map\" of the arteries. Doctors use this test to find the exact location of a blocked artery.\\n                \\nFor this test, dye is injected through a needle or catheter (tube) into one of your arteries. This may make you feel mildly flushed. After the dye is injected, an x ray is taken. The xray can show the location, type, and extent of the blockage in the artery.\\n                \\nSome doctors use a newer method of arteriogram that uses tiny ultrasound cameras. These cameras take pictures of the insides of the blood vessels. This method is called intravascular ultrasound.\\n                \\nBlood Tests\\n                \\nYour doctor may recommend blood tests to check for P.A.D. risk factors. For example, blood tests can help diagnose conditions such as diabetes and high blood cholesterol.', 'Treatments for peripheral artery disease (P.A.D.) include lifestyle changes, medicines, and surgery or procedures.\\n                \\nThe overall goals of treating P.A.D. include reducing risk of heart attack and stroke; reducing symptoms of claudication; improving mobility and overall quality of life; and preventing complications. Treatment is based on your signs and symptoms, risk factors, and the results of physical exams and tests.\\n                \\n\\n                \\nTreatment may slow or stop the progression of the disease and reduce the risk of complications. Without treatment, P.A.D. may progress, resulting in serious tissue damage in the form of sores or gangrene (tissue death) due to inadequate blood flow. In extreme cases of P.A.D., also referred to as critical limb ischemia (CLI), removal (amputation) of part of the leg or foot may be necessary.\\n                \\n\\n                \\n\\n                \\nLifestyle Changes\\n                \\nTreatment often includes making long-lasting lifestyle changes, such as:\\n                \\nPhysical activity\\n                \\nQuitting smoking\\n                \\nHeart-healthy eating\\n                \\n\\n                \\nPhysical Activity\\n                \\nRoutine physical activity can improve P.A.D. symptoms and lower many risk factors for atherosclerosis, including LDL (bad) cholesterol, high blood pressure, and excess weight. Exercise can improve the distances you can comfortably walk.\\n                \\nTalk with your doctor about taking part in a supervised exercise program. If a supervised program is not an option, ask your doctor to help you develop an exercise plan. Most exercise programs begin slowly, which includes simple walking alternating with rest. Over time, most people build up the amount of time they can walk before developing pain. The more active you are, the more you will benefit.\\n                \\n\\n                \\n\\n                \\nQuitting Smoking\\n                \\nIf you smoke, quit. Smoking raises your risk for P.A.D. Smoking also raises your risk for other diseases, such as coronary heart disease and heart attack, and worsens other coronary heart disease risk factors. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhandsmoke.\\n                \\nIf you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.\\n                \\n\\n                \\nRead more about quitting smoking at Smoking and Your Heart.\\n                \\n\\n                \\n\\n                \\nHeart-Healthy Eating\\n                \\nYour doctor may recommend heart-healthy eating to treat atherosclerosis, the most common cause of P.A.D. Following heart-healthy eating can help control blood pressure and cholesterol levels, which can lead to atherosclerosis.\\n                \\n\\n                \\nMedicines\\n                \\nYour doctor may prescribe medicines to:\\n                \\nPrevent blood clots from forming due to low blood flow with anticlotting medicines, such as aspirin.\\n                \\nTreat unhealthy cholesterol levels with statins. Statins control or lower blood cholesterol. By lowering your blood cholesterol level, you can decrease your chance of developing complications from P.A.D.\\n                \\nTreat high blood pressure with one of many high blood pressure medicines.\\n                \\nHelp ease leg pain that occurs when you walk or climb stairs.\\n                \\nReduce the symptoms of intermittent claudication, measured by increased walking distance with certain platelet-aggregation inhibitors.\\n                \\n\\n                \\nSurgery or Procedures\\n                \\nBypass Grafting\\n                \\nYour doctor may recommend bypass grafting surgery if blood flow in your limb is blocked or nearly blocked. For this surgery, your doctor uses a blood vessel from another part of your body or a synthetic tube to make a graft.\\n                \\nThis graft bypasses (that is, goes around) the blocked part of the artery. The bypass allows blood to flow around the blockage. This surgery doesnt cure P.A.D., but it may increase blood flow to the affected limb.\\n                \\n\\n                \\nAngioplasty and Stent Placement\\n                \\nYour doctor may recommend angioplasty to restore blood flow through a narrowed or blockedartery.\\n                \\nDuring this procedure, a catheter (thin tube) with a balloon at the tip is inserted into a blocked artery. The balloon is then inflated, which pushes plaque outward against the artery wall. This widens the artery and restores blood flow.\\n                \\n\\n                \\nA stent (a small mesh tube) may be placed in the artery during angioplasty. A stent helps keep the artery open after angioplasty is done. Some stents are coated with medicine to help prevent blockages in the artery.\\n                \\n\\n                \\nAtherectomy\\n                \\nAtherectomy is a procedure that removes plaque buildup from an artery. During the procedure, a catheter is used to insert a small cutting device into the blocked artery. The device is used to shave or cut off plaque.\\n                \\nThe bits of plaque are removed from the body through the catheter or washed away in the bloodstream (if theyre small enough).\\n                \\n\\n                \\nDoctors also can perform atherectomy using a special laser that dissolves the blockage.\\n                \\n\\n                \\nOther Types of Treatment\\n                \\nResearchers are studying cell and gene therapies to treat P.A.D. However, these treatments arent yet available outside of clinical trials. Read more about clinicaltrials.', 'Taking action to control your risk factors can help prevent or delay peripheral artery disease (P.A.D.) and its complications. Know your family history of health problems related to P.A.D. If you or someone in your family has the disease, be sure to tell your doctor. Controlling risk factors includes the following.\\n                \\nBe physically active.\\n                \\nBe screened for P.A.D. A simple office test, called an ankle-brachial index or ABI, can help determine whether you have P.A.D.\\n                \\nFollow heart-healthy eating.\\n                \\nIf you smoke, quit. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quitsmoking.\\n                \\nIf youre overweight or obese, work with your doctor to create a reasonable weight-loss plan.\\n                \\nThe lifestyle changes described above can reduce your risk of developing P.A.D. These changes also can help prevent and control conditions that can be associated with P.A.D., such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, andstroke.', 'Rh incompatibility is a condition that occurs during pregnancy if a woman has Rh-negative blood and her baby has Rh-positive blood.\\n                \\n\"Rh-negative\" and \"Rh-positive\" refer to whether your blood has Rh factor. Rh factor is a protein on red blood cells. If you have Rh factor, you\\'re Rh-positive. If you don\\'t have it, you\\'re Rh-negative. Rh factor is inherited (passed from parents to children through the genes). Most people are Rh-positive.\\n                \\nWhether you have Rh factor doesn\\'t affect your general health. However, it can cause problems during pregnancy.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nWhen you\\'re pregnant, blood from your baby can cross into your bloodstream, especially during delivery. If you\\'re Rh-negative and your baby is Rh-positive, your body will react to the baby\\'s blood as a foreign substance.\\n                \\nYour body will create antibodies (proteins) against the baby\\'s Rh-positive blood. These antibodies usually don\\'t cause problems during a first pregnancy. This is because the baby often is born before many of the antibodies develop.\\n                \\nHowever, the antibodies stay in your body once they have formed. Thus, Rh incompatibility is more likely to cause problems in second or later pregnancies (if the baby is Rh-positive).\\n                \\nThe Rh antibodies can cross the placenta and attack the baby\\'s red blood cells. This can lead to hemolytic anemia (HEE-moh-lit-ick uh-NEE-me-uh) in the baby.\\n                \\nHemolytic anemia is a condition in which red blood cells are destroyed faster than the body can replace them. Red blood cells carry oxygen to all parts of the body.\\n                \\nWithout enough red blood cells, your baby won\\'t get enough oxygen. This can lead to serious problems. Severe hemolytic anemia may even be fatal to the child.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nWith prompt and proper prenatal care and screening, you can prevent the problems of Rh incompatibility. Screening tests allow your doctor to find out early in your pregnancy whether you\\'re at risk for the condition.\\n                \\nIf you\\'re at risk, your doctor will carefully check on you and your baby throughout your pregnancy and prescribe treatment as needed.\\n                \\nInjections of a medicine called Rh immune globulin can keep your body from making Rhantibodies. This medicine helps prevent the problems of Rh incompatibility. If you\\'re Rh-negative, you\\'ll need this medicine every time you have a baby with Rh-positive blood.\\n                \\nOther events also can expose you to Rh-positive blood, which could affect a pregnancy. Examples include a miscarriage or blood transfusion. If you\\'re treated with Rh immune globulin right after these events, you may be able to avoid Rh incompatibility during your next pregnancy.']}"}, "time": 1746283465.702442}
