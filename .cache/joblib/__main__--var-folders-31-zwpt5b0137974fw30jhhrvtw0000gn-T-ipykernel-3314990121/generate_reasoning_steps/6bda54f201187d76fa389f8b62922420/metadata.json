Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'How is Sotos syndrome inherited? Sotos syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that having a mutation in only one of the 2 copies of the responsible gene (the NSD1 gene) is enough to cause signs and symptoms of the condition. 95% of people with Sotos syndrome do not inherit the condition from a parent. In these cases, the condition is the result of a new (de novo) mutation that occurred for the first time in the affected person. Only about 5% of people with Sotos syndrome have an affected parent and inherit the condition from that parent. If a parent of an affected person with an identified NSD1 mutation does not have any features of Sotos syndrome, that parent is very unlikely to have a mutation in the gene. This can be confirmed with genetic testing if the mutation has been identified in the child. If a person with Sotos syndrome has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit the mutation. However, the specific features and severity can vary from one generation to the next, so it is not possible to predict how a child will be affected.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Spondylometaphyseal dysplasia Algerian type?

Signs and symptoms in newborns may include a lack of energy, unwillingness to eat, seizures, unusual body movements, and poorly controlled breathing or body temperature. Complications may include coma, developmental delay, and learning disability. Some individuals have a less severe form of the deficiency, and have milder symptoms that may not appear until later in life. Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency is caused by mutations in the CPS1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion.']}"}, "time": 1746283457.5521789}
