People can become infected with a hantavirus through contact with hantavirus-infected rodents or their saliva, urine and/or droppings. Early symptoms universally include fatigue, fever and muscle aches (especially in the thighs, hips, and/or back), and sometimes include headaches, dizziness, chills, and abdominal problems such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and pain. Later symptoms of the syndrome occur 4 to 10 days after initial onset and include coughing and shortness of breath. HPS can be fatal; approximately 38% of individuals with HPS do not survive. There is no cure or specific treatment for HPS, but early diagnosis and treatment in intensive care may increase the chance of recovery.', 'Primary hyperoxaluria type 2  is a rare condition characterized by the overproduction of a substance called oxalate (also called oxalic acid). In the kidneys, the excess oxalate combines with calcium to form calcium oxalate, a hard compound that is the main component of kidney stones. Deposits of calcium oxalate can lead to kidney damage, kidney failure, and injury to other organs. Primary hyperoxaluria type 2 is caused by the shortage (deficiency) of an enzyme called glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR) that normally prevents the buildup of oxalate. This enzyme shortage is caused by mutations in the GRHPR gene. Primary hyperoxaluria type 2 is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Primary hyperoxaluria type 2? Primary hyperoxaluria type 2 is characterized by recurrent nephrolithiasis (deposition of calcium oxalate in the kidney and urinary tract), nephrocalcinosis (deposition of calcium oxalate in the kidney tissue), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). After ESRD, oxalosis (widespread tissue deposition of calcium oxalate) usually develops. Presenting symptoms are typically those associated with the presence of kidney stones, including hematuria, renal colic (a type of abdominal pain caused by kidney stones), or obstruction of the urinary tract. The symptoms of primary hyperoxaluria type 2 are typically less severe than primary hyperoxaluria type 1 and may be limited to kidney stone formation. Symptom onset may occur in childhood or adolescence. End stage renal disease is rarely observed in childhood. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Primary hyperoxaluria type 2. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Renal insufficiency 5% Aminoaciduria - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis - Hematuria - Hyperoxaluria - Nephrocalcinosis - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What causes primary hyperoxaluria type 2? Researchers have identified more than a dozen GRHPR mutations that cause this condition. These mutations either introduce signals that disrupt production of the glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase enzyme or alter its structure. As a result, enzyme activity is absent or dramatically reduced. Glyoxylate builds up because of the enzyme shortage, and is converted to a compound called oxalate instead of glycolate. Oxalate, in turn, combines with calcium to form calcium oxalate, which the body cannot readily eliminate. Deposits of calcium oxalate can lead to the characteristic features of primary hyperoxaluria type 2.']}"}, "time": 1746283459.2894442}
