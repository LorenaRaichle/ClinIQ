Many of the signs and symptoms are similar to those of other diseases.\\n                \\nSigns and symptoms of hemochromatosis usually don't occur until middle age. Women are more likely to have general symptoms first, such as fatigue (tiredness). In men, complications such as diabetes or cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) often are the first signs of the disease.\\n                \\nSigns and symptoms also vary based on the severity of the disease. Common signs and symptoms of hemochromatosis include joint pain, fatigue, general weakness, weight loss, and stomach pain.\\n                \\nNot everyone who has hemochromatosis has signs or symptoms of the disease. Estimates of how many people develop signs and symptoms vary greatly. Some estimates suggest that as many as half of all people who have the disease don't have signs or symptoms.\\n                \\nHemochromatosis Complications\\n                \\nIf hemochromatosis isn't found and treated early, iron builds up in your body and can lead to:\\n                \\nLiver disease, including an enlarged liver, liver failure, liver cancer, or cirrhosis (scarring of the liver)\\n                \\nHeart problems, including arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) and heart failure\\n                \\nDiabetes, especially in people who have a family history of diabetes\\n                \\nJoint damage and pain, including arthritis\\n                \\nReproductive organ failure, such as erectile dysfunction (impotence), shrinkage of the testicles, and loss of sex drive in men, and absence of the menstrual cycle and early menopause in women\\n                \\nChanges in skin color that make the skin look gray or bronze\\n                \\nUnderactive pituitary and thyroid glands\\n                \\nDamage to the adrenal glands\", \"Your doctor will diagnose hemochromatosis based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and the results from tests and procedures.\\n                \\nThe disease sometimes is detected while checking for other diseases or conditions, such as arthritis, liver disease, diabetes, heart disease, or erectile dysfunction (impotence).\\n                \\nSpecialists Involved\\n                \\nFamily doctors and internal medicine specialists may diagnose and treat hemochromatosis. Other doctors also may be involved in diagnosing and treating the disease, including:\\n                \\nHematologists (blood disease specialists)\\n                \\nCardiologists (heart specialists)\\n                \\nEndocrinologists (gland system specialists)\\n                \\nHepatologists (liver specialists)\\n                \\nGastroenterologists (digestive tract specialists)\\n                \\nRheumatologists (specialists in diseases of the joints and tissues)\\n                \\nMedical and Family Histories\\n                \\nTo learn about your medical and family histories, your doctor may ask:\\n                \\nAbout your signs and symptoms, including when they started and their severity.\\n                \\nWhether you take iron (pills or injections) with or without vitamin C supplements (vitamin C helps your body absorb iron from food). If so, your doctor may ask how much iron you take. This information can help him or her diagnose secondary hemochromatosis.\\n                \\nWhether other members of your family have hemochromatosis.\\n                \\nWhether other members of your family have a history of medical problems or diseases related to hemochromatosis.\\n                \\nPhysical Exam\\n                \\nYour doctor will do a physical exam to check for signs and symptoms of hemochromatosis. He or she will listen to your heart for irregular heartbeats and check for arthritis, abnormal skin color, and an enlarged liver.\\n                \\nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\\n                \\nYour doctor may recommend one or more tests or procedures to diagnose hemochromatosis.\\n                \\nBlood Tests\\n                \\nIn hemochromatosis, the amount of iron in your body may be too high, even though the level of iron in your blood is normal. Certain blood tests can help your doctor find out how much iron is in your body. \\n                \\nDuring these tests, a sample of blood is taken from your body. It's usually drawn from a vein in your arm using a needle. The procedure usually is quick and easy, although it may cause some short-term discomfort.\\n                \\nThe blood tests you have may include transferrin saturation (TS), serum ferritin level, and liver function tests.\\n                \\nTransferrin is a protein that carries iron in the blood. The TS test shows how much iron the transferrin is carrying. This helps your doctor find out how much iron is in your body.\\n                \\nYour doctor may test your serum ferritin level if your TS level is high. A serum ferritin level test shows how much iron is stored in your body's organs. A buildup of iron may suggest hemochromatosis.\\n                \\nYou may have liver function tests to check for damage to your liver. Liver damage may be a sign of hemochromatosis. If you have hemochromatosis, liver function tests may show the severity of the disease.\\n                \\nBlood tests alone can't diagnose hemochromatosis. Thus, your doctor may recommend other tests as well.\\n                \\nLiver Biopsy\\n                \\nDuring a liver biopsy, your doctor numbs an area near your liver and then removes a small sample of liver tissue using a needle. The tissue is then looked at under a microscope.\\n                \\nA liver biopsy can show how much iron is in your liver. This procedure also can help your doctor diagnose liver damage (for example, scarring and cancer). Liver biopsies are less common now than in the past.\\n                \\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging\\n                \\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a safe test that uses radio waves, magnets, and a computer to create pictures of your organs. An MRI may be done to show the amount of iron in your liver.\\n                \\nSuperconducting Quantum Interference Device\\n                \\nA superconducting quantum interference device (SQuID) is a machine that uses very sensitive magnets to measure the amount of iron in your liver. This machine is available at only a few medical centers.\\n                \\nGenetic Testing\\n                \\nGenetic testing can show whether you have a faulty HFE gene or genes. However, even if you do have two faulty HFE genes, the genetic test can't predict whether you'll develop signs and symptoms of hemochromatosis.\\n                \\nAlso, genetic testing may not detect other, less common faulty genes that also can cause hemochromatosis.\\n                \\nThere are two ways to do genetic testing. Cells can be collected from inside your mouth using a cotton swab, or a sample of blood can be drawn from a vein in your arm.\\n                \\nPeople who have hemochromatosis (or a family history of it) and are planning to have children may want to consider genetic testing and counseling. Testing will help show whether one or both parents have faulty HFE genes. A genetic counselor also can help figure out the likelihood of the parents passing the faulty genes on to their children.\", \"Treatments for hemochromatosis include therapeutic phlebotomy (fleh-BOT-o-me), iron chelation (ke-LAY-shun) therapy, dietary changes, and treatment for complications.\\n                \\nThe goals of treating hemochromatosis include:\\n                \\nReducing the amount of iron in your body to normal levels\\n                \\nPreventing or delaying organ damage from iron overload\\n                \\nTreating complications of the disease\\n                \\nMaintaining a normal amount of iron in your body for the rest of your life\\n                \\nTherapeutic Phlebotomy\\n                \\nTherapeutic phlebotomy is a procedure that removes blood (and iron) from your body. A needle is inserted into a vein, and your blood flows through an airtight tube into a sterile container or bag.\\n                \\nThe process is similar to donating blood; it can be done at blood donation centers, hospital donation centers, or a doctor's office.\\n                \\nIn the first stage of treatment, about 1 pint of blood is removed once or twice a week. After your iron levels return to normal, you may continue phlebotomy treatments. However, you may need them less oftentypically every 24 months.\\n                \\nAs long as treatment continues, which often is for the rest of your life, you'll need frequent blood tests to check your iron levels.\\n                \\nIron Chelation Therapy\\n                \\nIron chelation therapy uses medicine to remove excess iron from your body. This treatment is a good option for people who can't have routine blood removal.\\n                \\nThe medicine used in iron chelation therapy is either injected or taken orally (by mouth). Injected iron chelation therapy is done at a doctor's office. Oral iron chelation therapy can be done at home.\\n                \\nDietary Changes\\n                \\nYour doctor may suggest that you change your diet if you have hemochromatosis. You may be advised to:\\n                \\nAvoid taking iron, including iron pills, iron injections, or multivitamins that contain iron.\\n                \\nLimit your intake of vitamin C. Vitamin C helps your body absorb iron from food. Talk with your doctor about how much vitamin C is safe for you.\\n                \\nAvoid uncooked fish and shellfish. Some fish and shellfish contain bacteria that can cause infections in people who have chronic diseases, such as hemochromatosis.\\n                \\nLimit alcohol intake. Drinking alcohol increases the risk of liver disease. It also can make existing liver disease worse.\\n                \\nTreatment for Complications\\n                \\nYour doctor may prescribe other treatments as needed for complications such as liver disease, heart problems, or diabetes.\", 'You can\\'t prevent primary, or inherited, hemochromatosis. However, not everyone who inherits hemochromatosis genes develops symptoms or complications of the disease. In those who do, treatments can keep the disease from getting worse.\\n                \\nTreatments include therapeutic phlebotomy, iron chelation therapy, dietary changes, and other treatments. For more information, go to \"How Is Hemochromatosis Treated?\"\\n                \\nPeople who have hemochromatosis (or a family history of it) and are planning to have children may want to consider genetic testing and counseling. Testing will help show whether one or both parents have faulty HFE genes. A genetic counselor also can help figure out the likelihood of the parents passing the faulty genes on to their children.']}"}, "time": 1746283465.8954399}
