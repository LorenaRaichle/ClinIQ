During the exam, your doctor will listen to your heart with a stethoscope.\\n                \\nStretched valve flaps can make a clicking sound as they shut. If the mitral valve is leaking blood back into the left atrium, your doctor may heart a heart murmur or whooshing sound.\\n                \\nHowever, these abnormal heart sounds may come and go. Your doctor may not hear them at the time of an exam, even if you have MVP. Thus, you also may have tests and procedures to diagnose MVP.\\n                \\nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\\n                \\nEchocardiography\\n                \\nEchocardiography (echo) is the most useful test for diagnosing MVP. This painless test uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart.\\n                \\nEcho shows the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves are working. The test also can show areas of heart muscle that aren't contracting normally because of poor blood flow or injury to the heart muscle.\\n                \\nEcho can show prolapse of the mitral valve flaps and backflow of blood through the leaky valve.\\n                \\nThere are several types of echo, including stress echo. Stress echo is done before and after a stress test. During a stress test, you exercise or take medicine (given by your doctor) to make your heart work hard and beat fast.\\n                \\nYou may have stress echo to find out whether you have decreased blood flow to your heart (a sign of coronary heart disease).\\n                \\nEcho also can be done by placing a tiny probe in your esophagus to get a closer look at the mitral valve. The esophagus is the passage leading from your mouth to your stomach.\\n                \\nThe probe uses sound waves to create pictures of your heart. This form of echo is called transesophageal (tranz-ih-sof-uh-JEE-ul) echocardiography, or TEE.\\n                \\nDoppler Ultrasound\\n                \\nA Doppler ultrasound is part of an echo test. A Doppler ultrasound shows the speed and direction of blood flow through the mitral valve.\\n                \\nOther Tests\\n                \\nOther tests that can help diagnose MVP include:\\n                \\nA chest x ray. This test is used to look for fluid in your lungs or to show whether your heart is enlarged.\\n                \\nAn EKG (electrocardiogram). An EKG is a simple test that records your heart's electrical activity. An EKG can show how fast your heart is beating and whether its rhythm is steady or irregular. This test also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through your heart.\", \"Most people who have mitral valve prolapse (MVP) dont need treatment because they dont have symptoms and complications.\\n                \\nEven people who do have symptoms may not need treatment. The presence of symptoms doesnt always mean that the backflow of blood through the valve is significant.\\n                \\nPeople who have MVP and troublesome mitral valve backflow may be treated with medicines, surgery, or both.\\n                \\nThe goals of treating MVP include:\\n                \\nCorrecting the underlying mitral valve problem, if necessary\\n                \\nPreventinginfective endocarditis,arrhythmias, and other complications\\n                \\nRelieving symptoms\\n                \\nMedicines\\n                \\nMedicines called beta blockers may be used to treatpalpitationsand chest discomfort in people who have little or no mitral valve backflow.\\n                \\nIf you have significant backflow and symptoms, your doctor may prescribe:\\n                \\nBlood-thinning medicines to reduce the risk of blood clots forming if you haveatrial fibrillation.\\n                \\nDigoxin to strengthen your heartbeat.\\n                \\nDiuretics (fluidpills) to remove excess sodium and fluid in your body and lungs.\\n                \\nMedicines such as flecainide and procainamide to regulate your heart rhythms.\\n                \\nVasodilators to widen your blood vessels and reduce your hearts workload. Examples of vasodilators are isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine.\\n                \\nTake all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to.\\n                \\nSurgery\\n                \\nSurgery is done only if the mitral valve is very abnormal and blood is flowing back into the atrium. The main goal of surgery is to improve symptoms and reduce the risk ofheart failure.\\n                \\nThe timing of the surgery is important. If its done too early and your leaking valve is working fairly well, you may be put at needless risk from surgery. If its done too late, you may have heart damage that can't be fixed.\\n                \\nSurgical Approaches\\n                \\nTraditionally, heart surgeons repair or replace a mitral valve by making an incision (cut) in the breastbone and exposing the heart.\\n                \\nA small but growing number of surgeons are using another approach that involves one or more small cuts through the side of the chest wall. This results in less cutting, reduced blood loss, and a shorter hospital stay. However, not all hospitals offer this method.\\n                \\nValve Repair and Valve Replacement\\n                \\nIn mitral valve surgery, the valve is repaired or replaced. Valve repair is preferred when possible. Repair is less likely than replacement to weaken the heart. Repair also lowers the risk of infection and decreases the need for lifelong use of blood-thinning medicines.\\n                \\nIf repair isnt an option, the valve can be replaced. Mechanical and biological valves are used as replacement valves.\\n                \\nMechanical valves are man-made and can last a lifetime. People who have mechanical valves must take blood-thinning medicines for the rest of their lives.\\n                \\nBiological valves are taken from cows or pigs or made from human tissue. Many people who have biological valves dont need to take blood-thinning medicines for the rest of their lives. The major drawback of biological valves is that they weaken over time and often last only about 10 years.\\n                \\nAfter surgery, youll likely stay in the hospitals intensive care unit for 2 to 3 days. Overall, most people who have mitral valve surgery spend about 1 to 2 weeks in the hospital. Complete recovery takes a few weeks to several months, depending on your health before surgery.\\n                \\nIf youve had valve repair or replacement, you may need antibiotics before dental work and surgery. These procedures can allow bacteria to enter your bloodstream. Antibiotics can help prevent infective endocarditis, a serious heart valve infection. Discuss with your doctor whether you need to take antibiotics before such procedures.\\n                \\nTranscatheter Valve Therapy\\n                \\nInterventional cardiologists may be able to repair leaky mitral valves by implanting a device using a catheter (tube) inserted through a large blood vessel. This approach is less invasive and can prevent a person from havingopen-heart surgery. At present, the device is only approved for people with severe mitral regurgitation who cannot undergo surgery.\", \"You can't prevent mitral valve prolapse (MVP). Most people who have the condition are born with it.\\n                \\nComplications from MVP, such as arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) and infective endocarditis (IE), are rare. IE is an infection of the inner lining of your heart chambers and valves.\\n                \\nPeople at high risk for IE may be given antibiotics before some types of surgery and dental work. Antibiotics can help prevent IE. Your doctor will tell you whether you need this type of treatment.\\n                \\nPeople at high risk for IE may include those who've had valve repair or replacement or who have some types of underlying heart disease.\", \"Coronary microvascular disease (MVD) is heart disease that affects the tiny coronary (heart) arteries. In coronary MVD, the walls of the heart's tiny arteries are damaged or diseased.\\n                \\nCoronary MVD is different from traditional coronary heart disease (CHD), also called coronary artery disease. In CHD, a waxy substance called plaque (plak) builds up in the large coronary arteries.\\n                \\nPlaque narrows the heart's large arteries and reduces the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle. The buildup of plaque also makes it more likely that blood clots will form in your arteries. Blood clots can mostly or completely block blood flow through a coronary artery.\\n                \\nIn coronary MVD, however, the heart's tiny arteries are affected. Plaque doesn't create blockages in these vessels as it does in the heart's large arteries.\\n                \\nCoronary Microvascular Disease\\n                \\n\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nBoth men and women who have coronary microvascular disease often have diabetes or high blood pressure. Some people who have coronary microvascular disease may have inherited heart muscle diseases.\\n                \\nDiagnosing coronary microvascular disease has been a challenge for doctors. Standard tests used to diagnose coronary heart disease arent designed to detect coronary microvascular disease. More research is needed to find the best diagnostic tests and treatments for thedisease.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nMost of what is known about coronary MVD comes from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Wise study (Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation).\\n                \\nThe WISE study started in 1996. The goal of the study was to learn more about how heart disease develops in women.\\n                \\nCurrently, research is ongoing to learn more about the role of hormones in heart disease and to find better ways to diagnose coronary MVD.\\n                \\nStudies also are under way to learn more about the causes of coronary MVD, how to treat the disease, and the expected health outcomes for people with coronary MVD.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283466.396825}
