The localized type is the most common form of the condition.', 'The four major types of epidermolysis bullosa simplex can result from mutations in either the KRT5 or KRT14 gene. These genes provide instructions for making proteins called keratin 5 and keratin 14. These tough, fibrous proteins work together to provide strength and resiliency to the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis). Mutations in either the KRT5 or KRT14 gene prevent the keratin proteins from assembling into strong networks, causing cells in the epidermis to become fragile and easily damaged. As a result, the skin is less resistant to friction and minor trauma and blisters easily. In rare cases, no KRT5 or KRT14 gene mutations are identified in people with one of the four major types of epidermolysis bullosa simplex.  Mutations in another gene, PLEC, have been associated with the rare Ogna type of epidermolysis bullosa simplex. The PLEC gene provides instructions for making a protein called plectin, which helps attach the epidermis to underlying layers of skin. Researchers are working to determine how PLEC gene mutations lead to the major features of the condition.', 'Epidermolysis bullosa simplex is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Some affected people inherit the mutation from one affected parent. Other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.  In rare cases, epidermolysis bullosa simplex is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Autosomal recessive inheritance means the condition results when two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder typically each carry one copy of the altered gene, but do not show signs and symptoms of the disorder.', \"These resources address the diagnosis or management of epidermolysis bullosa simplex:  - Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa Research Association (DebRA) of America: Wound Care  - Epidermolysis Bullosa Center, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex  - Genetic Testing Registry: Epidermolysis bullosa simplex  - Genetic Testing Registry: Epidermolysis bullosa simplex with mottled pigmentation  - Genetic Testing Registry: Epidermolysis bullosa simplex, Cockayne-Touraine type  - Genetic Testing Registry: Epidermolysis bullosa simplex, Koebner type  - Genetic Testing Registry: Epidermolysis bullosa simplex, Ogna type  - Genetic Testing Registry: Epidermolysis bullosa simplex, autosomal recessive  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Epidermolysis Bullosa   These resources from MedlinePlus offer information about the diagnosis and management of various health conditions:  - Diagnostic Tests  - Drug Therapy  - Surgery and Rehabilitation  - Genetic Counseling   - Palliative Care\"]}"}, "time": 1746283450.75824}
