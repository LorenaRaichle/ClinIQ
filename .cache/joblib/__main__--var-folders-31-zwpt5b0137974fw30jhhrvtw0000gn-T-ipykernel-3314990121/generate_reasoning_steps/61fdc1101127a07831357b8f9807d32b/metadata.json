The doctors may give you medicines that make you feel more comfortable.  - All dialysis and transplant centers have a dietitian. The dietitian helps people with kidney failure learn about healthy food choices.', \"You and your doctor will work together to choose a treatment that's best for you.

Each cluster is called a glomerulus, which comes from the Greek word meaning filter. The plural form of the word is glomeruli. There are approximately 1 million glomeruli, or filters, in each kidney. The glomerulus is attached to the opening of a small fluid-collecting tube called a tubule. Blood is filtered in the glomerulus, and extra fluid and wastes pass into the tubule and become urine. Eventually, the urine drains from the kidneys into the bladder through larger tubes called ureters.\\n                \\nEach glomerulus-and-tubule unit is called a nephron.
