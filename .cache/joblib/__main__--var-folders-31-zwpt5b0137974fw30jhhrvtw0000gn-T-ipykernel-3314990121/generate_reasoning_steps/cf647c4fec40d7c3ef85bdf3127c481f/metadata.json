The FLCN gene provides instructions for making a protein called folliculin. In the lungs, folliculin is found in the connective tissue cells that allow the lungs to contract and expand when breathing. Folliculin is also produced in cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli). Researchers have not determined the protein's function, but they believe it may help control the growth and division of cells. Folliculin may play a role in repairing and re-forming lung tissue following damage. Researchers have not determined how FLCN gene mutations lead to the formation of blebs and increase the risk of primary spontaneous pneumothorax. One theory is that the altered folliculin protein may trigger inflammation within the lung tissue that could alter and damage the tissue, causing blebs.  Primary spontaneous pneumothorax most often occurs in people without an identified gene mutation. The cause of the condition in these individuals is often unknown. Tall young men are at increased risk of developing primary spontaneous pneumothorax; researchers suggest that rapid growth of the chest during growth spurts may increase the likelihood of forming blebs. Smoking can also contribute to the development of primary spontaneous pneumothorax.\", 'When this condition is caused by mutations in the FLCN gene, it is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, a person inherits the FLCN gene mutation from an affected parent. People who have an FLCN gene mutation associated with primary spontaneous pneumothorax all appear to develop blebs, but it is estimated that only 40 percent of those individuals go on to have a primary spontaneous pneumothorax.', 'These resources address the diagnosis or management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax:  - Genetic Testing Registry: Pneumothorax, primary spontaneous  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Chest Tube Insertion  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Collapsed Lung  - Merck Manual for Patients and Caregivers   These resources from MedlinePlus offer information about the diagnosis and management of various health conditions:  - Diagnostic Tests  - Drug Therapy  - Surgery and Rehabilitation  - Genetic Counseling   - Palliative Care', 'Mainzer-Saldino syndrome is a disorder characterized by kidney disease, eye problems, and skeletal abnormalities.  People with Mainzer-Saldino syndrome have chronic kidney disease that begins in childhood and gets worse over time. The rate at which the kidney disease worsens is variable, but the condition eventually leads to kidney failure in most affected individuals.  Degeneration of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina) almost always occurs in this disorder, but the age at which this feature develops varies. Some affected individuals are blind or have severe vision impairment beginning in infancy, with the pattern of vision loss resembling a condition called Leber congenital amaurosis. In other people with Mainzer-Saldino syndrome, the retinal degeneration begins in childhood, but some vision is retained into early adulthood. The vision loss in these affected individuals resembles a category of retinal disorders called rod-cone dystrophies. The most common rod-cone dystrophy is called retinitis pigmentosa, and the vision problems in Mainzer-Saldino syndrome are sometimes referred to as such. However, the abnormal deposits of pigment in the retina from which retinitis pigmentosa gets its name are often not found in Mainzer-Saldino syndrome. As a result, some researchers use terms such as \"atypical retinitis pigmentosa without pigment\" to describe the retinal degeneration that occurs in Mainzer-Saldino syndrome.  The skeletal abnormality most characteristic of Mainzer-Saldino syndrome consists of cone-shaped ends of the bones (epiphyses) in the fingers (phalanges) that can be seen on x-ray images after the first year of life. Affected individuals may also have abnormalities of the thigh bones that occur in the epiphyses and adjacent areas where bone growth occurs (the metaphyses). Occasionally, other skeletal abnormalities occur, including short stature and premature fusion of certain skull bones (craniosynostosis) that affects the shape of the head and face. Affected individuals may also have a small rib cage, which sometimes causes breathing problems in infancy, but the breathing problems are usually mild.  A small number of individuals with this disorder have additional problems affecting other organs. These can include liver disease resulting in a buildup of scar tissue in the liver (hepatic fibrosis); cerebellar ataxia, which is difficulty with coordination and balance arising from problems with a part of the brain called the cerebellum; and mild intellectual disability.']}"}, "time": 1746283448.4925592}
