Your risk of heart disease increases with the number of risk factors you have.\\n                \\nOne step you can take is to adopt a healthy lifestyle. A healthy lifestyle should be part of a lifelong approach to healthy living. A healthy lifestyle includes:\\n                \\nFollowing a healthy diet\\n                \\nMaintaining a healthy weight\\n                \\nBeing physically active\\n                \\nQuitting smoking\\n                \\nManaging stress\\n                \\nYou also should know your family history of diabetes and heart disease.

Take all of your medicines exactly as your doctor advises.\\n                \\nPeople who have diabetes also need good blood sugar control. Controlling your blood sugar level is good for heart health. Ask your doctor about the best ways to control your blood sugar level.\\n                \\nFor more information about lifestyle changes and medicines, go to \"How Is Diabetic Heart Disease Treated?\"', \"Tetralogy (teh-TRAL-o-je) of Fallot (fah-LO) is a congenital heart defect. This is a problem with the heart's structure that's present at birth. Congenital heart defects change the normal flow of blood through the heart.\\n                \\nTetralogy of Fallot is a rare, complex heart defect. It occurs in about 5out of every 10,000 babies. The defect affects boys and girls equally.\\n                \\nTo understand tetralogy of Fallot, it helps to know how a healthy heart works. The Health Topics How the Heart Works article describes the structure and function of a healthy heart. The article also has animations that show how your heart pumps blood and how your heart's electrical system works.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nTetralogy of Fallot involves four heart defects:\\n                \\nA large ventricular septal defect (VSD)\\n                \\nPulmonary (PULL-mun-ary) stenosis\\n                \\nRight ventricular hypertrophy (hi-PER-tro-fe)\\n                \\nAn overriding aorta\\n                \\nVentricular Septal Defect\\n                \\nThe heart has an inner wall that separates the two chambers on its left side from the two chambers on its right side. This wall is called a septum. The septum prevents blood from mixing between the two sides of the heart.\\n                \\nA VSD is a hole in the septum between the heart's two lower chambers, the ventricles. The hole allows oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle to mix with oxygen-poor blood from the right ventricle.\\n                \\nPulmonary Stenosis\\n                \\nThis defect involves narrowing of the pulmonary valve and the passage from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery.\\n                \\nNormally, oxygen-poor blood from the right ventricle flows through the pulmonary valve and into the pulmonary artery. From there, the blood travels to the lungs to pick up oxygen.\\n                \\nIn pulmonary stenosis, the pulmonary valve cannot fully open. Thus, the heart has to work harder to pump blood through the valve. As a result, not enough blood reaches the lungs.\\n                \\nRight Ventricular Hypertrophy\\n                \\nWith this defect, the muscle of the right ventricle is thicker than usual. This occurs because the heart has to work harder than normal to move blood through the narrowed pulmonary valve.\\n                \\nOverriding Aorta\\n                \\nThis defect occurs in the aorta, the main artery that carries oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the body. In a healthy heart, the aorta is attached to the left ventricle. This allows only oxygen-rich blood to flow to the body.\\n                \\nIn tetralogy of Fallot, the aorta is located between the left and right ventricles, directly over the VSD. As a result, oxygen-poor blood from the right ventricle flows directly into the aorta instead of into the pulmonary artery.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nWith tetralogy of Fallot, not enough blood is able to reach the lungs to get oxygen, and oxygen-poor blood flows to the body.\\n                \\nCross-Section of a Normal Heart and a Heart With Tetralogy of Fallot\\n                \\n\\n                \\nBabies and children who have tetralogy of Fallot have episodes of cyanosis (si-ah-NO-sis). Cyanosis is a bluish tint to the skin, lips, and fingernails. It occurs because the oxygen level in the blood leaving the heart is below normal.\\n                \\nTetralogy of Fallot is repaired with open-heart surgery, either soon after birth or later in infancy. The timing of the surgery will depend on how narrow the pulmonary artery is.\\n                \\nOver the past few decades, the diagnosis and treatment of tetralogy of Fallot have greatly improved. Most children who have this heart defect survive to adulthood. However, they'll need lifelong medical care from specialists to help them stay as healthy as possible.\", \"Doctors often don't know what causes tetralogy of Fallot and other congenital heart defects.\\n                \\nSome conditions or factors that occur during pregnancy may raise your risk of having a child who has tetralogy of Fallot. These conditions and factors include:\\n                \\nGerman measles (rubella) and some other viral illnesses\\n                \\nPoor nutrition\\n                \\nAlcohol use\\n                \\nAge (being older than 40)\\n                \\nDiabetes\\n                \\nHeredity may play a role in causing tetralogy of Fallot. An adult who has tetralogy of Fallot may be more likely than other people to have a baby with the condition.\\n                \\nChildren who have certain genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome and DiGeorge syndrome, often have congenital heart defects, including tetralogy of Fallot.\\n                \\nResearchers continue to search for the causes of tetralogy of Fallot and other congenital heart defects.\", 'Cyanosis is an important sign of tetralogy of Fallot. Cyanosis is a bluish tint to the skin, lips, and fingernails. Low oxygen levels in the blood cause cyanosis.\\n                \\nBabies who have unrepaired tetralogy of Fallot sometimes have \"tet spells.\" These spells happen in response to an activity like crying or having a bowel movement.\\n                \\nA tet spell occurs when the oxygen level in the blood suddenly drops. This causes the baby to become very blue. The baby also may:\\n                \\nHave a hard time breathing\\n                \\nBecome very tired and limp\\n                \\nNot respond to a parent\\'s voice or touch\\n                \\nBecome very fussy\\n                \\nPass out\\n                \\nIn years past, when tetralogy of Fallot wasn\\'t treated in infancy, children would get very tired during exercise and could faint. Now, doctors repair tetralogy of Fallot in infancy to prevent these symptoms.\\n                \\nAnother common sign of tetralogy of Fallot is a heart murmur. A heart murmur is an extra or unusual sound that doctors might hear while listening to the heart.\\n                \\nThe sound occurs because the heart defect causes abnormal blood flow through the heart. However, not all heart murmurs are signs of congenital heart defects. Many healthy children have heart murmurs.\\n                \\nBabies who have tetralogy of Fallot may tire easily while feeding. Thus, they may not gain weight or grow as quickly as children who have healthy hearts. Also, normal growth depends on a normal workload for the heart and normal flow of oxygen-rich blood to all parts of the body.\\n                \\nChildren who have tetralogy of Fallot also may have clubbing. Clubbing is the widening or rounding of the skin or bone around the tips of the fingers.']}"}, "time": 1746283466.433846}
