Because symptoms of broken heart syndrome are similar to those of a heart attack, it is important to seek help right away. Your doctor may not be able to diagnose broken heart syndrome until you have some tests.\\n                \\nCommon Signs and Symptoms\\n                \\nThe most common symptoms of broken heart syndrome are sudden, sharp chest pain and shortness of breath. Typically these symptoms begin just minutes to hours after experiencing a severe, and usually unexpected, stress.\\n                \\nBecause the syndrome involves severe heart muscle weakness, some people also may experience signs and symptoms such as fainting, arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs) (fast or irregular heartbeats), cardiogenic (KAR-de-o-JEN-ik) shock (when the heart cant pump enough blood to meet the bodys needs), low blood pressure, and heart failure.\\n                \\nDifferences From a Heart Attack\\n                \\nSome of the signs and symptoms of broken heart syndrome differ from those of a heart attack. For example, in people who have broken heart syndrome:\\n                \\nSymptoms (chest pain and shortness of breath) occur suddenly after having extreme emotional or physical stress.\\n                \\nEKG(electrocardiogram) results dont look the same as the results for a person having a heart attack. (An EKG is a test that records the hearts electrical activity.)\\n                \\nBlood tests show no signs or mild signs of heart damage.\\n                \\nTests show enlarged and unusual movement of the lower left heart chamber (the left ventricle).\\\\\\n                \\nTests show no signs of blockages in the coronary arteries.\\n                \\nRecovery time is quick, usually within days or weeks (compared with the recovery time of a month or more for a heart attack).\\n                \\nComplications\\n                \\nBroken heart syndrome can be life threatening in some cases. It can lead to serious heart problems such as:\\n                \\nHeart failure, a condition in which the heart cant pump enough blood to meet the bodys needs\\n                \\nHeart rhythm problems that cause the heart to beat much faster or slower than normal\\n                \\nHeart valve problems\\n                \\nThe good news is that most people who have broken heart syndrome make a full recovery within weeks. With medical care, even the most critically ill tend to make a quick and complete recovery.', \"Because the symptoms are similar, at first your doctor may not be able to tell whether you are experiencing broken heart syndrome or having a heart attack. Therefore, the doctors immediate goals will be:\\n                \\nTo determine whats causing your symptoms\\n                \\nTo determine whether youre having or about to have a heart attack\\n                \\nYour doctor will diagnose broken heart syndrome based on your signs and symptoms, your medical and family histories, and the results from tests and procedures.\\n                \\nSpecialists Involved\\n                \\nYour doctor may refer you to a cardiologist. A cardiologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating heart diseases and conditions.\\n                \\nPhysical Exam and Medical History\\n                \\nYour doctor will do a physical exam and ask you to describe your symptoms. He or she may ask questions such as when your symptoms began, where you are feeling pain or discomfort and what it feels like, and whether the pain is constant or varies.\\n                \\nTo learn about your medical history, your doctor may ask about your overall health, risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) and other heart disease, and family history. Your doctor will ask whether you've recently experienced any major stresses.\\n                \\nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\\n                \\nNo single test can diagnose broken heart syndrome. The tests and procedures for broken heart syndrome are similar to those used to diagnose CHD or heart attack. The diagnosis is made based on the results of the following standards tests to rule out heart attack and imaging studies to help establish broken heart syndrome.\\n                \\nStandard Tests and Procedures\\n                \\n\\n                \\nEKG (Electrocardiogram)\\n                \\n\\n                \\nAnEKGis a simple, painless test that detects and records the hearts electrical activity. The test shows how fast your heart is beating and whether its rhythm is steady or irregular. An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through each part of the heart.\\n                \\nThe EKG may show abnormalities in your heartbeat, a sign of broken heart syndrome as well as heart damage due to CHD.\\n                \\n\\n                \\nBlood Tests\\n                \\nBlood tests check the levels of certain substances in your blood, such as fats, cholesterol, sugar, and proteins. Blood tests help greatly in diagnosing broken heart syndrome, because certain enzymes (proteins in the blood) may be present in the blood to indicate the condition.\\n                \\nImaging Procedures\\n                \\n\\n                \\nEchocardiography\\n                \\nEchocardiography(echo) uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. The test provides information about the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves are working. Echo also can show areas of heart muscle that aren't contracting well because of poor blood flow or previous injury.\\n                \\nThe echo may show slowed blood flow in the left chamber of the heart.\\n                \\n\\n                \\nChest X Ray\\n                \\nA chest x rayis a painless test that creates pictures of the structures in your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. Your doctor will need a chest x ray to analyze whether your heart has the enlarged shape that is a sign of broken heart syndrome.\\n                \\nA chest x ray can reveal signs of heart failure, as well as lung disorders and other causes of symptoms not related to broken heart syndrome.\\n                \\n\\n                \\nCardiac MRI\\n                \\nCardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a common test that uses radio waves, magnets, and a computer to make both still and moving pictures of your heart and major blood vessels. Doctors use cardiac MRI to get pictures of the beating heart and to look at its structure and function. These pictures can help them decide the best way to treat people who have heart problems.\\n                \\n\\n                \\nCoronary Angiography and Cardiac Catheterization\\n                \\nYour doctor may recommend coronary angiography (an-jee-OG-rah-fee) if other tests or factors suggest you have CHD. This test uses dye and special x rays to look inside your coronary arteries.\\n                \\nTo get the dye into your coronary arteries, your doctor will use a procedure called cardiac catheterization (KATH-eh-ter-ih-ZA-shun). A thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck. The tube is threaded into your coronary arteries, and the dye is released into your bloodstream.\\n                \\nSpecial x rays are taken while the dye is flowing through your coronary arteries. The dye lets your doctor study the flow of blood through your heart and blood vessels.\\n                \\n\\n                \\nVentriculogram\\n                \\nVentriculogram is another test that can be done during a cardiac catheterization that examines the left ventricle, which is the hearts main pumping chamber. During this test, a dye is injected into the inside of the heart and x ray pictures are taken. The test can show the ventricles size and how well it pumps blood. It also shows how well the blood flows through the aortic and mitral values.\", 'Even though broken heart syndrome may feel like a heart attack, its a very different problem that needs a different type of treatment.\\n                \\nThe good news is that broken heart syndrome is usually treatable, and most people make a full recovery. Most people who experience broken heart syndrome stay in the hospital for a few days to a week.\\n                \\nInitial treatment is aimed at improving blood flow to the heart, and may be similar to that for a heart attack until the diagnosis is clear. Further treatment can include medicines and lifestyle changes.\\n                \\nMedicines\\n                \\nDoctors may prescribe medicines to relieve fluid buildup, treat blood pressure problems, prevent blood clots, and manage stress hormones. Medicines are often discontinued once heart function has returned to normal.\\n                \\nYour doctor may prescribe the following medicines:\\n                \\nACE inhibitors (or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors), to lower blood pressure and reduce strain on your heart\\n                \\nBeta blockers, to slow your heart rate and lower your blood pressure to decrease your hearts workload\\n                \\nDiuretics (water or fluid pills), to help reduce fluid buildup in your lungs and swelling in your feet and ankles\\n                \\nAnti-anxiety medicines, to help manage stress hormones\\n                \\nTake all of your medicines as prescribed. If you have side effects or other problems related to your medicines, tell your doctor. He or she may be able to provide other options.\\n                \\nTreatment of Complications\\n                \\nBroken heart syndrome can be life threatening in some cases. Because the syndrome involves severe heart muscle weakness, patients can experience shock, heart failure, low blood pressure, and potentially life-threatening heart rhythm abnormalities.\\n                \\nThe good news is that this condition improves very quickly, so with proper diagnosis and management, even the most critically ill tend to make a quick and complete recovery.\\n                \\nLifestyle Changes\\n                \\nTo stay healthy, its important to find ways to reduce stress and cope with particularly upsetting situations. Learning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health.\\n                \\nHaving supportive people in your life with whom you can share your feelings or concerns can help relieve stress. Physical activity, medicine, and relaxation therapy also can help relieve stress. You may want to consider taking part in a stress management program.\\n                \\nTreatments Not Helpful for Broken Heart Syndrome\\n                \\nSeveral procedures used to treat a heart attack are not helpful in treating broken heart syndrome. These procedurespercutaneous coronary intervention (sometimes referred to as angioplasty), stent placement, and surgerytreat blocked arteries, which is not the cause of broken heart syndrome.', 'Researchers are still learning about broken heart syndrome, and no treatments have been shown to prevent it. For people who have experienced the condition, the risk of recurrence is low.\\n                \\nAn emotionally upsetting or serious physical event can trigger broken heart syndrome. Learning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health.\\n                \\nHaving supportive people in your life with whom you can share your feelings or concerns can help relieve stress. Physical activity, medicine, and relaxation therapy also can help relieve stress. You may want to consider taking part in a stress management program.\\n                \\nAlso, some of the ways people cope with stresssuch as drinking, smoking, or overeatingarent healthy. Learning to manage stress includes adopting healthy habits that will keep your stress levels low and make it easier to deal with stress when it does happen. A healthy lifestyle includes following a healthy diet, being physically active, maintaining a healthy weight, and quitting smoking.']}"}, "time": 1746283466.603374}
