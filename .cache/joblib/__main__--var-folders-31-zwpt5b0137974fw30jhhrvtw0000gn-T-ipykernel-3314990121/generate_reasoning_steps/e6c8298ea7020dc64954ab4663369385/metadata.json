If a consultation with a CDC scientist specializing in rickettsial diseases is advised, your call will be appropriately forwarded. \\nCase Definitions \\n                \\nAs of January 1, 2010, cases of RMSF are reported under a new category called Spotted Fever Rickettsiosis (including Rocky Mountain spotted fever). \\n  \\n \\nCase Report Forms \\n                \\nFor confirmed and probable cases of RMSF that have been identified and reported through the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System, states are also encouraged to submit additional information using CDC Case Report Forms (CRFs). These forms collect additional important information that routine electronic reporting does not, such as information on how the diagnosis was made, and whether the patient was hospitalized or died. If a different state-specific form is already used to collect this information, this information may be submitted to CDC in lieu of CRFs.  \\n  \\n \\nHow to Submit Specimens to CDC for RMSF Testing \\n                \\nPrivate citizens may not directly submit specimens to CDC for testing. If you feel that diagnostic testing is necessary, consult your healthcare provider or state health department. \\nState Health Departments \\n                \\nSpecimens may be submitted to CDC for testing for rickettsial diseases, including RMSF. To coordinate specimen submission, please call 404 639 1075 during business hours (8:00 - 4:30 ET).  \\nU.S. Healthcare Providers \\n                \\nU.S. healthcare providers should not submit specimens for testing directly to CDC. CDC policy requires that specimens for testing be submitted through or with the approval of the state health department. Please contact your state health department, who will assist you with specimen submission and reporting of an infected patient. For general questions about RMSF, please call 1-800-CDC-INFO (1-800-232-4636). If you have questions about a suspect RMSF case, please first consult your state health department. Healthcare providers requiring an epidemiologic consultation on rickettsial diseases may also call 404-639-1075 during business hours (8:00 - 4:30 ET). Or 770-488-7100 after hours.  \\nNon-U.S. Healthcare Providers \\n                \\nNon-U.S. healthcare providers should consult CDC prior to submitting specimens for testing. For general questions about RMSF, please call 1-800-CDC-INFO (1-800-232-4636). If you would like to discuss a suspect rickettsial case with CDC, please call 404-639-1075 during business hours (8:00 - 4:30 ET), or 770-488-7100 after hours.', 'Whipworm (Trichuris trichiura) is an intestinal parasite of humans. The larvae and adult worms live in the intestine of humans and can cause intestinal disease. The name is derived from the worm\u2019s distinctive whip-like shape.', 'Whipworm is a soil-transmitted helminth (STH) and is the third most common roundworm of humans. Whipworm causes an infection called trichuriasis and often occurs in areas where human feces is used as fertilizer or where defecation onto soil happens. The worms are spread from person to person by fecal-oral transmission or through feces-contaminated food.\\n    Geographic Distribution\\nWorldwide, infection occurs more frequently in areas with tropical weather and poor sanitation practices, and among children. In 2002, the estimated number of persons infected with whipworm was 1 billion. Trichuriasis also occurs in the southern United States.', 'The standard method for diagnosing the presence of whipworm is by microscopically identifying whipworm eggs in a stool sample. Because eggs may be difficult to find in light infections, a concentration procedure is recommended.']}"}, "time": 1746283484.06702}
