V-fib is a type of arrhythmia.\\n                \\nDuring v-fib, the ventricles (the heart's lower chambers) don't beat normally. Instead, they quiver very rapidly and irregularly. When this happens, the heart pumps little or no blood to the body. V-fib is fatal if not treated within a few minutes.\\n                \\nOther problems with the heart's electrical system also can cause SCA. For example, SCA can occur if the rate of the heart's electrical signals becomes very slow and stops. SCA also can occur if the heart muscle doesn't respond to the heart's electrical signals.\\n                \\nCertain diseases and conditions can cause the electrical problems that lead to SCA. Examples include coronary heart disease (CHD), also called coronary artery disease; severe physical stress; certain inherited disorders; and structural changes in the heart.\\n                \\nSeveral research studies are under way to try to find the exact causes of SCA and how to prevent them.\\n                \\nCoronary Heart Disease\\n                \\nCHD is a disease in which a waxy substance called plaque (plak) builds up in the coronary arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle.\\n                \\nPlaque narrows the arteries and reduces blood flow to your heart muscle. Eventually, an area of plaque can rupture (break open). This may cause a blood clot to form on the plaque's surface.\\n                \\nA blood clot can partly or fully block the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the portion of heart muscle fed by the artery. This causes a heart attack.\\n                \\nDuring a heart attack, some heart muscle cells die and are replaced with scar tissue. The scar tissue damages the heart's electrical system. As a result, electrical signals may spread abnormally throughout the heart. These changes to the heart increase the risk of dangerous arrhythmias and SCA.\\n                \\nCHD seems to cause most cases of SCA in adults. Many of these adults, however, have no signs or symptoms of CHD before having SCA.\\n                \\nPhysical Stress\\n                \\nCertain types of physical stress can cause your heart's electrical system to fail. Examples include:\\n                \\nIntense physical activity. The hormone adrenaline is released during intense physical activity. This hormone can trigger SCA in people who have heart problems.\\n                \\nVery low blood levels of potassium or magnesium. These minerals play an important role in your heart's electrical signaling.\\n                \\nMajor blood loss.\\n                \\nSevere lack of oxygen.\\n                \\nInherited Disorders\\n                \\nA tendency to have arrhythmias runs in some families. This tendency is inherited, which means it's passed from parents to children through the genes. Members of these families may be at higher risk for SCA.\\n                \\nAn example of an inherited disorder that makes you more likely to have arrhythmias is long QT syndrome (LQTS). LQTS is a disorder of the heart's electrical activity. Problems with tiny pores on the surface of heart muscle cells cause the disorder. LQTS can cause sudden, uncontrollable, dangerous heart rhythms.\\n                \\nPeople who inherit structural heart problems also may be at higher risk for SCA. These types of problems often are the cause of SCA in children.\\n                \\nStructural Changes in the Heart\\n                \\nChanges in the heart's normal size or structure may affect its electrical system. Examples of such changes include an enlarged heart due to high blood pressure or advanced heart disease. Heart infections also may cause structural changes in the heart.\", 'The risk of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) increases:\\n                \\nWith age\\n                \\nIf you are a man. Men are more likely than women to have SCA.\\n                \\nSome studies show that blacksparticularly those with underlying conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease or certain cardiac findings on tests such as an electrocardiogramhave a higher risk forSCA.\\n                \\nMajor Risk Factor\\n                \\nThe major risk factor for SCA is coronary heart disease. Most people who have SCA have some degree of coronary heart disease; however, many people may not know that they have coronary heart disease until SCA occurs. Usually their coronary heart disease is silentthat is, it has no signs or symptoms. Because of this, doctors and nurses have not detected it.\\n                \\nMany people who have SCA also have silent, or undiagnosed, heart attacks before sudden cardiac arrest happens. These people have no clear signs of heart attack, and they dont even realize that theyve had one. Read more about coronary heart disease risk factors.\\n                \\nOther Risk Factors\\n                \\nOther risk factors for SCA include:\\n                \\nA personal history of arrhythmias\\n                \\nA personal or family history of SCA or inherited disorders that make you prone toarrhythmias\\n                \\nDrug or alcohol abuse\\n                \\nHeart attack\\n                \\nHeart failure', 'Usually, the first sign of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is loss of consciousness (fainting). At the same time, no heartbeat (or pulse) can be felt.\\n                \\nSome people may have a racing heartbeat or feel dizzy or light-headed just before they faint. Within an hour before SCA, some people have chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea (feeling sick to the stomach), or vomiting.', \"Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) happens without warning and requires emergency treatment. Doctors rarely diagnose SCA with medical tests as it's happening. Instead, SCA often is diagnosed after it happens. Doctors do this by ruling out other causes of a person's sudden collapse.\\n                \\nSpecialists Involved\\n                \\nIf you're at high risk for SCA, your doctor may refer you to a cardiologist. This is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating heart diseases and conditions. Your cardiologist will work with you to decide whether you need treatment to prevent SCA.\\n                \\nSome cardiologists specialize in problems with the heart's electrical system. These specialists are called cardiac electrophysiologists.\\n                \\nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\\n                \\nDoctors use several tests to help detect the factors that put people at risk for SCA.\\n                \\nEKG (Electrocardiogram)\\n                \\nAn EKG is a simple, painless test that detects and records the heart's electrical activity. The test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through each part of the heart.\\n                \\nAn EKG can show evidence of heart damage due to coronary heart disease (CHD). The test also can show signs of a previous or current heart attack.\\n                \\nEchocardiography\\n                \\nEchocardiography, or echo, is a painless test that uses sound waves to create pictures of your heart. The test shows the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves are working.\\n                \\nEcho also can identify areas of poor blood flow to the heart, areas of heart muscle that aren't contracting normally, and previous injury to the heart muscle caused by poor blood flow.\\n                \\nThere are several types of echo, including stress echo. This test is done both before and after a cardiac stress test. During this test, you exercise (or are given medicine if you're unable to exercise) to make your heart work hard and beat fast.\\n                \\nStress echo shows whether you have decreased blood flow to your heart (a sign of CHD).\\n                \\nMUGA Test or Cardiac MRI\\n                \\nA MUGA (multiple gated acquisition) test shows how well your heart is pumping blood. For this test, a small amount of radioactive substance is injected into a vein and travels to your heart.\\n                \\nThe substance releases energy, which special cameras outside of your body can detect. The cameras use the energy to create pictures of many parts of your heart.\\n                \\nCardiac MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is a safe procedure that uses radio waves and magnets to create detailed pictures of your heart. The test creates still and moving pictures of your heart and major blood vessels.\\n                \\nDoctors use cardiac MRI to get pictures of the beating heart and to look at the structure and function of the heart.\\n                \\nCardiac Catheterization\\n                \\nCardiac catheterization is a procedure used to diagnose and treat certain heart conditions. A long, thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck and threaded to your heart. Through the catheter, your doctor can do diagnostic tests and treatments on your heart.\\n                \\nSometimes dye is put into the catheter. The dye will flow through your bloodstream to your heart. The dye makes your coronary (heart) arteries visible on x-ray pictures. The dye can show whether plaque has narrowed or blocked any of your coronary arteries.\\n                \\nElectrophysiology Study\\n                \\nFor an electrophysiology study, doctors use cardiac catheterization to record how your heart's electrical system responds to certain medicines and electrical stimulation. This helps your doctor find where the heart's electrical system is damaged.\\n                \\nBlood Tests\\n                \\nYour doctor may recommend blood tests to check the levels of potassium, magnesium, and other chemicals in your blood. These chemicals play an important role in your heart's electrical signaling.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283466.273898}
