Signs and symptoms depend on the following:          - Where the tumor forms in the brain.    - The size of the tumor and whether it has spread all through the brain stem.    - How fast the tumor grows.    - The child's age and development.        Some tumors do not cause signs or symptoms. Signs and symptoms may be caused by childhood brain stem gliomas or by other conditions. Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following:         - Loss of ability to move one side of the face and/or body.    - Loss of balance and trouble walking.     - Vision and hearing problems.    - Morning headache or headache that goes away after vomiting.    -  Nausea and vomiting.    - Unusual sleepiness.    - More or less energy than usual.    - Changes in behavior.    - Trouble learning in school.\", 'Tests that examine the brain are used to detect (find) childhood brain stem glioma. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Neurological exam : A series of questions and tests to check the brain, spinal cord, and nerve function. The exam checks a persons mental status, coordination, and ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles, senses, and reflexes work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam.     -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium : A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the brain. A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\\n                    - A biopsy may be done to diagnose certain types of brain stem glioma. If the MRI scan looks like the tumor is a DIPG, a biopsy is usually not done and the tumor is not removed.    If the MRI scan looks like a focal brain stem glioma, a biopsy may be done. A part of the skull is removed and a needle is used to remove a sample of the brain tissue. Sometimes, the needle is guided by a computer. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. If cancer cells are found, the doctor will remove as much tumor as safely possible during the same surgery.    The following test may be done on the tissue that was removed:         -   Immunohistochemistry : A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. This type of test may be used to tell the difference between brain stem glioma and other brain tumors.', 'Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis and treatment options depend on:         - The type of brain stem glioma.    - Where the tumor is found in the brain and if it has spread within the brain stem.    - The age of the child when diagnosed.    - Whether or not the child has a condition called neurofibromatosis type 1.    - Whether the tumor has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).', 'Key Points\\n                    - The plan for cancer treatment depends on whether the tumor is in one area of the brain or has spread all through the brain.\\n                \\n                \\n                    The plan for cancer treatment depends on whether the tumor is in one area of the brain or has spread all through the brain.\\n                    Staging is the process used to find out how much cancer there is and if cancer has spread. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.    There is no standard staging system for childhood brain stem glioma. Treatment is based on the following:         - Whether the tumor is newly diagnosed or recurrent (has come back after treatment).    - The type of tumor (either a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma or a focal glioma).']}"}, "time": 1746283464.5618649}
