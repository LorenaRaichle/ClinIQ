Surgeons use bone grafts to repair and rebuild diseased bones in your hips, knees, spine, and sometimes other bones and joints. Grafts can also repair bone loss caused by some types of fractures or cancers. Once your body accepts the bone graft, it provides a framework for growth of new, living bone.    If the transplanted bone comes from another person, it is called an allograft. Most allograft bone comes from donors who have died. Tissue banks screen these donors and disinfect and test the donated bone to make sure it is safe to use. If the transplanted bone comes from another part of your own body, it is called an autograft. Autograft bone often comes from your ribs, hips or a leg.', \"The ovaries are a pair of organs that women have. They are located in the pelvis, one on each side of the uterus. Each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond.    The ovaries produce a woman's eggs. If an egg is fertilized by a sperm, a pregnancy can result. Ovaries also make the female hormones estrogen and progesterone. When a woman goes through menopause, her ovaries stop releasing eggs and make far lower levels of hormones.    Problems with the ovaries include       - Ovarian cancer    - Ovarian cysts and polycystic ovary syndrome    - Premature ovarian failure    - Ovarian torsion, a twisting of the ovary\", 'Your liver is the largest organ inside your body. It helps your body digest food, store energy, and remove poisons. Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver.     Viruses cause most cases of hepatitis. The type of hepatitis is named for the virus that causes it; for example, hepatitis A, hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Drug or alcohol use can also cause hepatitis. In other cases, your body mistakenly attacks healthy cells in the liver.    Some people who have hepatitis have no symptoms. Others may have       - Loss of appetite    - Nausea and vomiting    - Diarrhea    - Dark-colored urine and pale bowel movements    - Stomach pain    - Jaundice, yellowing of skin and eyes       Some forms of hepatitis are mild, and others can be serious. Some can lead to scarring, called cirrhosis, or to liver cancer.    Sometimes hepatitis goes away by itself. If it does not, it can be treated with drugs. Sometimes hepatitis lasts a lifetime. Vaccines can help prevent some viral forms.', 'Summary : Drug abuse is a serious public health problem. It affects almost every community and family in some way. Drug abuse in children and teenagers may pose a greater hazard than in older people. This is because their brains are not yet fully developed. As a result, the brains of young people may be more susceptible to drug abuse and addiction than adult brains.    Abused drugs include       - Amphetamines     - Anabolic steroids     - Club drugs    - Cocaine     - Heroin     - Inhalants    - Marijuana    - Prescription drugs       There are different types of treatment for drug abuse. But it is better to prevent drug abuse in the first place.    NIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse']}"}, "time": 1746283466.976118}
