The most common cause of cardiogenic shock is damage to the heart muscle from a severe heart attack.\\n                \\nThis damage prevents the hearts main pumping chamber, the left ventricle (VEN-trih-kul), from working well. As a result, the heart can't pump enough oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body.\\n                \\nIn about 3 percent of cardiogenic shock cases, the hearts lower right chamber, the right ventricle, doesnt work well. This means the heart can't properly pump blood to the lungs, where it picks up oxygen to bring back to the heart and the rest of the body.\\n                \\nWithout enough oxygen-rich blood reaching the bodys major organs, many problems can occur. For example:\\n                \\nCardiogenic shock can cause death if the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the organs isn't restored quickly. This is why emergency medical treatment is required.\\n                \\nIf organs don't get enough oxygen-rich blood, they won't work well. Cells in the organs die, and the organs may never work well again.\\n                \\nAs some organs stop working, they may cause problems with other bodily functions. This, in turn, can worsen shock. For example:   - If the kidneys aren't working well, the levels of important chemicals in the body change. This may cause the heart and other muscles to become even weaker, limiting blood flow even more.   - If the liver isn't working well, the body stops making proteins that help the blood clot. This can lead to more bleeding if the shock is due to blood loss.\\n                \\nIf the kidneys aren't working well, the levels of important chemicals in the body change. This may cause the heart and other muscles to become even weaker, limiting blood flow even more.\\n                \\nIf the liver isn't working well, the body stops making proteins that help the blood clot. This can lead to more bleeding if the shock is due to blood loss.\\n                \\nHow well the brain, kidneys, and other organs recover will depend on how long a person is in shock. The less time a person is in shock, the less damage will occur to the organs. This is another reason why emergency treatment is so important.\\n                \\nUnderlying Causes\\n                \\nThe underlying causes of cardiogenic shock are conditions that weaken the heart and prevent it from pumping enough oxygen-rich blood to the body.\\n                \\nHeart Attack\\n                \\nMost heart attacks occur as a result of coronary heart disease (CHD). CHD is a condition in which a waxy substance called plaque (plak) narrows or blocks the coronary (heart) arteries.\\n                \\nPlaque reduces blood flow to your heart muscle. It also makes it more likely that blood clots will form in your arteries. Blood clots can partially or completely block blood flow.\\n                \\nConditions Caused by Heart Attack\\n                \\nHeart attacks can cause some serious heart conditions that can lead to cardiogenic shock. One example is ventricular septal rupture. This condition occurs if the wall that separates the ventricles (the hearts two lower chambers) breaks down.\\n                \\nThe breakdown happens because cells in the wall have died due to a heart attack. Without the wall to separate them, the ventricles cant pump properly.\\n                \\nHeart attacks also can cause papillary muscle infarction or rupture. This condition occurs if the muscles that help anchor the heart valves stop working or break because a heart attack cuts off their blood supply. If this happens, blood doesn't flow correctly between the hearts chambers. This prevents the heart from pumping properly.\\n                \\nOther Heart Conditions\\n                \\nSerious heart conditions that may occur with or without a heart attack can cause cardiogenic shock. Examples include:\\n                \\nMyocarditis (MI-o-kar-DI-tis). This is inflammation of the heart muscle.\\n                \\nEndocarditis (EN-do-kar-DI-tis). This is an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves.\\n                \\nLife-threatening arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs). These are problems with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat.\\n                \\nPericardial tamponade (per-ih-KAR-de-al tam-po-NADE). This is too much fluid or blood around the heart. The fluid squeezes the heart muscle so it can't pump properly.\\n                \\nPulmonary Embolism\\n                \\nPulmonary embolism (PE) is a sudden blockage in a lung artery. This condition usually is caused by a blood clot that travels to the lung from a vein in the leg. PE can damage your heart and other organs in your body.\", \"The most common risk factor for cardiogenic shock is having a heart attack. If you've had a heart attack, the following factors can further increase your risk for cardiogenic shock:\\n                \\nOlder age\\n                \\nA history of heart attacks or heart failure\\n                \\nCoronary heart disease that affects all of the hearts major blood vessels\\n                \\nHigh blood pressure\\n                \\nDiabetes\\n                \\nWomen who have heart attacks are at higher risk for cardiogenic shock than men who have heart attacks.\", 'A lack of oxygen-rich blood reaching the brain, kidneys, skin, and other parts of the body causes the signs and symptoms of cardiogenic shock.\\n                \\nSome of the typical signs and symptoms of shock usually include at least two or more of the following:\\n                \\nConfusion or lack of alertness\\n                \\nLoss of consciousness\\n                \\nA sudden and ongoing rapid heartbeat\\n                \\nSweating\\n                \\nPale skin\\n                \\nA weak pulse\\n                \\nRapid breathing\\n                \\nDecreased or no urine output\\n                \\nCool hands and feet\\n                \\nAny of these alone is unlikely to be a sign or symptom of shock.\\n                \\nIf you or someone else is having these signs and symptoms, call 911 right away for emergency treatment. Prompt medical care can save your life and prevent or limit organ damage.', \"The first step in diagnosing cardiogenic shock is to identify that a person is in shock. At that point, emergency treatment should begin.\\n                \\nOnce emergency treatment starts, doctors can look for the specific cause of the shock. If the reason for the shock is that the heart isn't pumping strongly enough, then the diagnosis is cardiogenic shock.\\n                \\nTests and Procedures To Diagnose Shock and Its Underlying Causes\\n                \\nBlood Pressure Test\\n                \\nMedical personnel can use a simple blood pressure cuff and stethoscope to check whether a person has very low blood pressure. This is the most common sign of shock. A blood pressure test can be done before the person goes to a hospital.\\n                \\nLess serious conditions also can cause low blood pressure, such as fainting or taking certain medicines, such as those used to treat high blood pressure.\\n                \\nEKG (Electrocardiogram)\\n                \\nAn EKG is a simple test that detects and records the heart's electrical activity. The test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular).\\n                \\nAn EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through each part of the heart. Doctors use EKGs to diagnose severe heart attacks and monitor the heart's condition.\\n                \\nEchocardiography\\n                \\nEchocardiography (echo) uses sound waves to create a moving picture of the heart. The test provides information about the size and shape of the heart and how well the heart chambers and valves are working.\\n                \\nEcho also can identify areas of poor blood flow to the heart, areas of heart muscle that aren't contracting normally, and previous injury to the heart muscle caused by poor blood flow.\\n                \\nChest X Ray\\n                \\nA chest x ray takes pictures of organs and structures in the chest, including the heart, lungs, and blood vessels. This test shows whether the heart is enlarged or whether fluid is present in the lungs. These can be signs of cardiogenic shock.\\n                \\nCardiac Enzyme Test\\n                \\nWhen cells in the heart die, they release enzymes into the blood. These enzymes are called markers or biomarkers. Measuring these markers can show whether the heart is damaged and the extent of the damage.\\n                \\nCoronary Angiography\\n                \\nCoronary angiography (an-jee-OG-ra-fee) is an x-ray exam of the heart and blood vessels. The doctor passes a catheter (a thin, flexible tube) through an artery in the leg or arm to the heart. The catheter can measure the pressure inside the heart chambers.\\n                \\nDye that can be seen on an x-ray image is injected into the bloodstream through the tip of the catheter. The dye lets the doctor study the flow of blood through the heart and blood vessels and see any blockages.\\n                \\nPulmonary Artery Catheterization\\n                \\nFor this procedure, a catheter is inserted into a vein in the arm or neck or near the collarbone. Then, the catheter is moved into the pulmonary artery. This artery connects the right side of the heart to the lungs.\\n                \\nThe catheter is used to check blood pressure in the pulmonary artery. If the blood pressure is too high or too low, treatment may be needed.\\n                \\nBlood Tests\\n                \\nSome blood tests also are used to help diagnose cardiogenic shock, including:\\n                \\nArterial blood gas measurement. For this test, a blood sample is taken from an artery. The sample is used to measure oxygen, carbon dioxide, and pH (acidity) levels in the blood. Certain levels of these substances are associated with shock.\\n                \\nTests that measure the function of various organs, such as the kidneys and liver. If these organs aren't working well, they may not be getting enough oxygen-rich blood. This could be a sign of cardiogenic shock.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283465.3503602}
