Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person has one affected parent. As myotonic dystrophy is passed from one generation to the next, the disorder generally begins earlier in life and signs and symptoms become more severe. This phenomenon is called anticipation.  Some individuals diagnosed with Myotonic dystrophy type 1 have an obviously affected parent; others do not. A parent may appear to be unaffected because symptoms may be mild or absent. Genetic testing is available to confirm the presence of the condition.', 'How might myotonic dystrophy type 1 associated vision problems be treated? Treatment of eye and vision problems must be individually tailored. Refractive error and astigmatism can be corrected with eyeglasses, contact lenses, or surgery. Special glasses with eye \"crutches\" can be used to improve vision in people with ptosis. Surgery can be done to treat ptosis and cataracts, however ptosis often recurs and special precautions must be taken with anesthesia. If severe, strabismus may also be treated with surgery.', 'Hereditary multiple osteochondromas (HMO) (formerly called hereditary multiple exostoses) is a genetic condition in which people develop multiple benign (noncancerous) bone tumors that are covered by cartilage (called osteochondromas). The number and location of osteochondromas varies greatly among affected individuals. These tumors are not present at birth, but almost all affected people develop multiple osteochondromas by the time they are 12 years old. Once the bones stop growing, the development of new osteochondromas also usually stops. Osteochondromas can cause abnormal growth of the arms, hands, and legs, which can lead to uneven limb lengths (limb length discrepancy) and short stature. These tumors may cause pain, limit joint movement, and exert pressure on nerves, blood vessels, and surrounding tissues. Osteochondromas are typically benign; however, researchers estimate that people with HMO have about a 1% lifetime risk of these tumors becoming a cancerous osteochondrosarcoma. HMO is caused by mutations in the EXT1 and EXT2 genes and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Hereditary multiple osteochondromas? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Hereditary multiple osteochondromas. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the humerus 90% Abnormality of the tibia 90% Abnormality of the femur 50% Abnormality of the metaphyses 50% Abnormality of the teeth 50% Abnormality of the ulna 50% Anteverted nares 50% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the radius 50% Aseptic necrosis 50% Bone pain 50% Chondrocalcinosis 50% Cranial nerve paralysis 50% Exostoses 50% Genu valgum 50% Madelung deformity 50% Micromelia 50% Muscle weakness 50% Short stature 50% Abnormal pyramidal signs 7.5% Abnormality of pelvic girdle bone morphology 7.5% Abnormality of the pericardium 7.5% Aneurysm 7.5% Elbow dislocation 7.5% Hemiplegia/hemiparesis 7.5% Osteoarthritis 7.5% Osteolysis 7.5% Recurrent fractures 7.5% Scoliosis 7.5% Synostosis of joints 7.5% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.']}"}, "time": 1746283460.092496}
