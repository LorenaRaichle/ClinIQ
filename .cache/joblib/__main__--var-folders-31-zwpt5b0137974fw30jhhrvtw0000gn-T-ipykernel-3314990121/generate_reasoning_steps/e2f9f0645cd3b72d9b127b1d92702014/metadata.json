Some of these cases are associated with changes in specific genes; however in some cases the cause of the disorder is unknown.  Many cases of severe congenital neutropenia are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.  Less often, this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.  In rare cases, severe congenital neutropenia is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. In these cases, the gene that causes the condition is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.', \"These resources address the diagnosis or management of severe congenital neutropenia:  - Cincinnati Children's Hospital: The Severe Congenital Neutropenia International Registry  - Gene Review: Gene Review: ELANE-Related Neutropenia  - Gene Review: Gene Review: G6PC3 Deficiency  - Genetic Testing Registry: Severe congenital neutropenia  - Genetic Testing Registry: Severe congenital neutropenia 2, autosomal dominant  - Genetic Testing Registry: Severe congenital neutropenia 4, autosomal recessive  - Genetic Testing Registry: Severe congenital neutropenia X-linked  - Genetic Testing Registry: Severe congenital neutropenia autosomal dominant  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Neutropenia--infants   These resources from MedlinePlus offer information about the diagnosis and management of various health conditions:  - Diagnostic Tests  - Drug Therapy  - Surgery and Rehabilitation  - Genetic Counseling   - Palliative Care\", 'Sitosterolemia is a condition in which fatty substances (lipids) from vegetable oils, nuts, and other plant-based foods accumulate in the blood and tissues. These lipids are called plant sterols (or phytosterols). Sitosterol is one of several plant sterols that accumulate in this disorder, with a blood level 30 to 100 times greater than normal. Cholesterol, a similar fatty substance found in animal products, is mildly to moderately elevated in many people with sitosterolemia. Cholesterol levels are particularly high in some affected children.  Plant sterols are not produced by the body; they are taken in as components of foods. Signs and symptoms of sitosterolemia begin to appear early in life after foods containing plant sterols are introduced into the diet.  An accumulation of fatty deposits on the artery walls (atherosclerosis) may occur by adolescence or early adulthood in people with sitosterolemia. The deposits narrow the arteries and can eventually block blood flow, increasing the chance of a heart attack, stroke, or sudden death.  People with sitosterolemia typically develop small yellowish growths called xanthomas beginning in childhood. The xanthomas consist of accumulated lipids and may be located anywhere on or just under the skin, typically on the heels, knees, elbows, and buttocks. They may also occur in the bands that connect muscles to bones (tendons), including tendons of the hand and the tendon that connects the heel of the foot to the calf muscles (the Achilles tendon). Large xanthomas can cause pain, difficulty with movement, and cosmetic problems.  Joint stiffness and pain resulting from plant sterol deposits may also occur in individuals with sitosterolemia. Less often, affected individuals have blood abnormalities. Occasionally the blood abnormalities are the only signs of the disorder. The red blood cells may be broken down (undergo hemolysis) prematurely, resulting in a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). This type of anemia is called hemolytic anemia. Affected individuals sometimes have abnormally shaped red blood cells called stomatocytes. In addition, the blood cells involved in clotting, called platelets or thrombocytes, may be abnormally large (macrothrombocytopenia).', 'Only 80 to 100 individuals with sitosterolemia have been described in the medical literature. However, researchers believe that this condition is likely underdiagnosed because mild cases often do not come to medical attention. Studies suggest that the prevalence may be at least 1 in 50,000 people.']}"}, "time": 1746283451.411747}
