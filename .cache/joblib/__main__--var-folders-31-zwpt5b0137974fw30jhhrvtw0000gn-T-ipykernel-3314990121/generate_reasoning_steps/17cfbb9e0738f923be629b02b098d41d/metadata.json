Dietary changes or supplements can prevent these types of anemia from occurring again.\\n                \\nTreating anemia's underlying cause may prevent the condition (or prevent repeat episodes). For example, if medicine is causing your anemia, your doctor may prescribe another type of medicine.\\n                \\nTo prevent anemia from getting worse, tell your doctor about all of your signs and symptoms. Talk with your doctor about the tests you may need and follow your treatment plan.\\n                \\nYou can't prevent some types of inherited anemia, such as sickle cell anemia. If you have an inherited anemia, talk with your doctor about treatment and ongoing care.\", 'An aneurysm (AN-u-rism) is a balloon-like bulge in an artery. Arteries are blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood to your body.\\n                \\nArteries have thick walls to withstand normal blood pressure. However, certain medical problems, genetic conditions, and trauma can damage or injure artery walls. The force of blood pushing against the weakened or injured walls can cause an aneurysm.\\n                \\nAn aneurysm can grow large and rupture (burst) or dissect. A rupture causes dangerous bleeding inside the body. A dissection is a split in one or more layers of the artery wall. The split causes bleeding into and along the layers of the artery wall.\\n                \\nBoth rupture and dissection often are fatal.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nMost aneurysms occur in the aorta, the main artery that carries oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the body. The aorta goes through the chest and abdomen.\\n                \\nAn aneurysm that occurs in the chest portion of the aorta is called a thoracic (tho-RAS-ik) aortic aneurysm. An aneurysm that occurs in the abdominal portion of the aorta is called an abdominal aortic aneurysm.\\n                \\nAneurysms also can occur in other arteries, but these types of aneurysm are less common. This article focuses on aortic aneurysms.\\n                \\nAbout 13,000 Americans die each year from aortic aneurysms. Most of the deaths result from rupture or dissection.\\n                \\nEarly diagnosis and treatment can help prevent rupture and dissection. However, aneurysms can develop and grow large before causing any symptoms. Thus, people who are at high risk for aneurysms can benefit from early, routine screening.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nDoctors often can successfully treat aortic aneurysms with medicines or surgery if theyre found in time. Medicines may be given to lower blood pressure, relax blood vessels, and reduce the risk of rupture.\\n                \\nLarge aortic aneurysms often can be repaired with surgery. During surgery, the weak or damaged portion of the aorta is replaced or reinforced.', 'The force of blood pushing against the walls of an artery combined with damage or injury to the arterys walls can cause an aneurysm.\\n                \\nMany conditions and factors can damage and weaken the walls of the aorta and cause aortic aneurysms. Examples include aging, smoking, high blood pressure, and atherosclerosis (ath-er-o-skler-O-sis). Atherosclerosis is the hardening and narrowing of the arteries due to the buildup of a waxy substance called plaque (plak).\\n                \\nRarely, infectionssuch as untreated syphilis (a sexually transmitted infection)can cause aortic aneurysms. Aortic aneurysms also can occur as a result of diseases that inflame the blood vessels, such as vasculitis (vas-kyu-LI-tis).\\n                \\nA family history of aneurysms also may play a role in causing aortic aneurysms.\\n                \\nIn addition to the factors above, certain genetic conditions may cause thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs). Examples of these conditions include Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (the vascular type), and Turner syndrome.\\n                \\nThese genetic conditions can weaken the bodys connective tissues and damage the aorta. People who have these conditions tend to develop aneurysms at a younger age than other people. Theyre also at higher risk for rupture and dissection.\\n                \\nTrauma, such as a car accident, also can damage the walls of the aorta and lead to TAAs.\\n                \\nResearchers continue to look for other causes of aortic aneurysms. For example, theyre looking for genetic mutations (changes in the genes) that may contribute to or cause aneurysms.', 'Certain factors put you at higher risk for an aortic aneurysm. These factors include:\\n                \\nMale gender. Men are more likely than women to have aortic aneurysms.\\n                \\nAge. The risk for abdominal aortic aneurysms increases as you get older. These aneurysms are more likely to occur in people who are aged 65 or older.\\n                \\nSmoking. Smoking can damage and weaken the walls of the aorta.\\n                \\nA family history of aortic aneurysms. People who have family histories of aortic aneurysms are at higher risk for the condition, and they may have aneurysms before the age of 65.\\n                \\nA history of aneurysms in the arteries of the legs.\\n                \\nCertain diseases and conditions that weaken the walls of the aorta. Examples include high blood pressure and atherosclerosis.\\n                \\nHaving a bicuspid aortic valve can raise the risk of having a thoracic aortic aneurysm. A bicuspid aortic valve has two leaflets instead of the typical three.\\n                \\nCar accidents or trauma also can injure the arteries and increase the risk for aneurysms.\\n                \\nIf you have any of these risk factors, talk with your doctor about whether you need screening for aneurysms.']}"}, "time": 1746283465.37869}
