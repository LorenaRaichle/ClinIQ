Corticosteroids are typically the first-line of treatment and may be required for several months or years. These medications are often given orally; however, in severe cases, intravenous methylprednisolone may be prescribe initially. Immunosuppressive medications may also be recommended, especially in people with severe muscle weakness or symptomatic interstitial lung disease. Physical therapy is often necessary to improve weakness, reduce further muscle wasting from disuse, and prevent muscle contractures.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Faciocardiorenal syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Faciocardiorenal syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal localization of kidney 90% Abnormality of the philtrum 90% Abnormality of the pinna 90% Cleft palate 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Hypertelorism 90% Hypoplasia of the zygomatic bone 90% Plagiocephaly 90% Reduced number of teeth 90% Underdeveloped nasal alae 90% Wide nasal bridge 90% Abnormality of the endocardium 50% Abnormality of the tricuspid valve 7.5% Narrow mouth 7.5% Autosomal recessive inheritance - Broad hallux - Cryptorchidism - Decreased muscle mass - Endocardial fibroelastosis - Horseshoe kidney - Hydroureter - Hypodontia - Hypoplastic philtrum - Inguinal hernia - Intellectual disability, progressive - Intellectual disability, severe - Malar flattening - Microtia - Nevus - Scoliosis - Small nail - Toe syndactyly - Waddling gait - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Glaucoma 3 primary infantile B?
