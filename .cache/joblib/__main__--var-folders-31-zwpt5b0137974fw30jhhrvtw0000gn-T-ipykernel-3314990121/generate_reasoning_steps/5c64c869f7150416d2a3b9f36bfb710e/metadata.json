Acanthamoeba causes three main types of illness involving the eye (Acanthamoeba keratitis), the brain and spinal cord (Granulomatous Encephalitis), and infections that can spread throughout the entire body (disseminated infection).', 'Acanthamoeba keratitis\\n  \\n   \\nAcanthamoeba keratitis is a rare disease that can affect anyone, but is most common in individuals who wear contact lenses. In the United States, an estimated 85% of cases occur in contact lens users. The incidence of the disease in developed countries is approximately one to 33 cases per million contact lens wearers.\\n   \\nFor people who wear contact lenses, certain practices can increase the risk of getting Acanthamoeba keratitis:\\n   \\n    - Storing and handling lenses improperly\\n    - Disinfecting lenses improperly (such as using tap water or topping off solutions when cleaning the lenses or lens case)\\n    - Swimming, using a hot tub, or showering while wearing lenses\\n    - Coming into contact with contaminated water\\n    - Having a history of trauma to the cornea\\n   \\n   \\nContact lens wearers who practice proper lens care and non-contact lens wearers can still develop the infection.
