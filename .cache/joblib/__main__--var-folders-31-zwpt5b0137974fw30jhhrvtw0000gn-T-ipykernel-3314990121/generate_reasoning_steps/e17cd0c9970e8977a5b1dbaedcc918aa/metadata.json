Treatment of ring chromosome 20 is typically focused on management of seizures. The seizures associated with ring chromosome 20 do not generally respond well to medications. The treatment that is successful varies from person to person. Broad spectrum AEDs are usually tried first since they are active against different seizure types. This includes valproate, levetiracetam, lamotrigine, topiramate and zonisamide. Success has been reported in some people with a combination of valproate and lamotrigine, but so far no single therapy has worked for everyone.  Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has been tried and a reduction in seizures has been reported in some cases but not in others. This involves implanting a medical device under the skin, similar to a pacemaker that delivers a mild electrical current to the brain via the vagus nerve. The long-term effectiveness of VNS therapy is not yet known.  The ketogenic diet, which is high in fat and low in carbohydrate, has been shown to be helpful in other types of epilepsy. However there are no published reports about whether this is successful or not in ring chromosome 20 epilepsy.

People with these conditions can present at any age with almost any affected body system; however, the brain, muscles, heart, liver, nerves, eyes, ears and kidneys are the organs and tissues most commonly affected. Symptom severity can also vary widely. Mitochondrial genetic disorders can be caused by changes (mutations) in either the mitochondrial DNA or nuclear DNA that lead to dysfunction of the mitochondria and inadequate production of energy. Those caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA are transmitted by maternal inheritance, while those caused by mutations in nuclear DNA may follow an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked pattern of inheritance. Treatment varies based on the specific type of condition and the signs and symptoms present in each person.', \"What are the signs and symptoms of mitochondrial genetic disorders? People with mitochondrial genetic disorders can present at any age with almost any affected body system. While some conditions may only affect a single organ, many involve multiple organ systems including the brain, muscles, heart, liver, nerves, eyes, ears and/or kidneys. Symptom severity can also vary widely. The most common signs and symptoms include: Poor growth Loss of muscle coordination Muscle weakness Seizures Autism Problems with vision and/or hearing Developmental delay Learning disabilities Heart, liver, and/or kidney disease Gastrointestinal disorders Diabetes Increased risk of infection Thyroid and/or adrenal abnormalities Autonomic dysfunction Dementia The United Mitochondrial Disease Foundation's website features a comprehensive list of possible symptoms (click here to see this information) and symptoms categorized by type of mitochondrial genetic disorder (click here to access this page).\", 'What causes mitochondrial genetic disorders? Mitochondrial genetic disorders can be caused by changes (mutations) in either the mitochondrial DNA or nuclear DNA that lead to dysfunction of the mitochondria. Most DNA (hereditary material that is passed from parent to child) is packaged within the nucleus of each cell (known as nuclear DNA). However, mitochondria (the structures in each cell that produce energy) contain a small amount of their own DNA, which is known as mitochondrial DNA. When the mitochondria are not working properly, the body does not have enough energy to carry out its normal functions. This can lead to the variety of health problems associated with mitochondrial genetic disorders.']}"}, "time": 1746283460.45219}
