The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Sener syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Anteriorly placed anus - Chronic diarrhea - Coarse hair - Delayed eruption of permanent teeth - Eczema - Entropion - High palate - Hyperopic astigmatism - Hypertelorism - Hypodontia - Hypoplasia of the corpus callosum - Inguinal hernia - Micropenis - Microtia - Natal tooth - Patent ductus arteriosus - Perivascular spaces - Polyhydramnios - Posteriorly rotated ears - Smooth philtrum - Sporadic - Umbilical hernia - Wide anterior fontanel - Wide mouth - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Pineal cysts are cysts of the pineal gland which is a small organ in the brain that produces melatonin (a sleep-regulating hormone). Pineal cysts are relatively common and may be found by chance in up to 10% of people undergoing CT or MRI brain imaging. The exact cause of pineal cysts is unknown. Most people with pineal cysts do not have any signs or symptoms. Rarely, a pineal cyst may cause headaches, hydrocephalus, eye movement abnormalities, and Parinaud syndrome. Treatment is usually only considered when a cyst is causing symptoms, in which case surgery, stereotactic aspiration or endoscopic treatment may be recommended.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of pineal cysts? People with pineal cysts generally do not have any signs or symptoms. Occasionally, pineal cysts may cause headaches, hydrocephalus, disturbances in vision (gaze palsy), Parinaud syndrome, and vertigo, in which case they are called symptomatic pineal cysts. Although rare, people with symptomatic pineal cysts may have other symptoms such as difficulty moving (ataxia); mental and emotional disturbances; seizures; sleep (circadian rhythm) troubles; hormonal imbalances that may cause precocious puberty; or secondary parkinsonism.', 'What causes pineal cysts? The exact cause of pineal cysts is unknown. However, some studies suggest that bleeding in the pineal region or hormonal influences may play a role in the development and progression of pineal cysts.']}"}, "time": 1746283454.5190191}
