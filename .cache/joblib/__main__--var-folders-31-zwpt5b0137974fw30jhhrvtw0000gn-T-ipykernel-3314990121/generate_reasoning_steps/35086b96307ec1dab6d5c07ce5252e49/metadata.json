Pain may be sharp or dull. It may come and go, or it may be constant. You may feel pain in one area of your body, such as your back, abdomen or chest or you may feel pain all over, such as when your muscles ache from the flu.    Pain can be helpful in diagnosing a problem. Without pain, you might seriously hurt yourself without knowing it, or you might not realize you have a medical problem that needs treatment. Once you take care of the problem, pain usually goes away. However, sometimes pain goes on for weeks, months or even years. This is called chronic pain. Sometimes chronic pain is due to an ongoing cause, such as cancer or arthritis. Sometimes the cause is unknown.    Fortunately, there are many ways to treat pain. Treatment varies depending on the cause of pain. Pain relievers, acupuncture and sometimes surgery are helpful.', 'Summary : A stroke can cause lasting brain damage. People who survive a stroke need to relearn skills they lose because of the damage. Rehabilitation can help them relearn those skills.    Stroke can cause five types of disabilities:       - Paralysis or problems controlling movement    - Pain and other problems with the senses    - Problems using or understanding language    - Problems with thinking and memory    - Emotional disturbances            Stroke rehabilitation involves many kinds of health professionals. The goal is to help survivors become as independent as possible and to have the best possible quality of life.    NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Summary : You can help prevent medical errors by being an active member of your health care team. Research shows that patients who are more involved with their care tend to get better results. To reduce the risk of medical errors, you can       - Ask questions if you have doubts or concerns. Take a relative or friend to your doctor appointment to help you ask questions and understand answers.    - Make sure you understand what will happen if you need surgery    - Tell your health care providers about all the medicines you take, including over-the-counter drugs and dietary supplements. Tell them if you have any allergies or bad reactions to anesthesia. Make sure you know how to take your medications correctly.     - Get a second opinion about treatment options    - Keep a copy of your own health history       Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', \"If you have a swallowing disorder, you may have difficulty or pain when swallowing. Some people cannot swallow at all. Others may have trouble swallowing liquids, foods, or saliva. This makes it hard to eat. Often, it can be difficult to take in enough calories and fluids to nourish your body.    Anyone can have a swallowing disorder, but it is more likely in the elderly. It often happens because of other conditions, including       -  Nervous system disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and cerebral palsy    -  Problems with your esophagus, including GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease)    -  Stroke    -  Head or spinal cord injury    -  Cancer of the head, neck, or esophagus       Medicines can help some people, while others may need surgery. Swallowing treatment with a speech-language pathologist can help. You may find it helpful to change your diet or hold your head or neck in a certain way when you eat. In very serious cases, people may need feeding tubes.    NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders\"]}"}, "time": 1746283467.3617349}
