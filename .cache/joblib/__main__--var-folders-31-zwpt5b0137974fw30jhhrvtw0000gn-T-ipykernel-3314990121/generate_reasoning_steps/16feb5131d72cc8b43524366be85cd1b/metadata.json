It's the most minor form. Technically, a concussion is a short loss of normal brain function in response to a head injury. But people often use it to describe any minor injury to the head or brain.    Concussions are a common type of sports injury. You can also have one if you suffer a blow to the head or hit your head after a fall.    Symptoms of a concussion may not start right away; they may start days or weeks after the injury. Symptoms may include a headache or neck pain. You may also have nausea, ringing in your ears, dizziness, or tiredness. You may feel dazed or not your normal self for several days or weeks after the injury. Consult your health care professional if any of your symptoms get worse, or if you have more serious symptoms such as       - Seizures    - Trouble walking or sleeping    - Weakness, numbness, or decreased coordination    - Repeated vomiting or nausea    - Confusion    - Slurred speech       Doctors use a neurologic exam and imaging tests to diagnose a concussion. Most people recover fully after a concussion, but it can take some time. Rest is very important after a concussion because it helps the brain to heal.    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\", \"Lymphedema is the name of a type of swelling. It happens when lymph builds up in your body's soft tissues. Lymph is a fluid that contains white blood cells that defend against germs. It can build up when the lymph system is damaged or blocked. It usually happens in the arms or legs.    Causes of lymphedema include       - Infection    - Cancer    - Scar tissue from radiation therapy or surgical removal of lymph nodes    - Inherited conditions in which lymph nodes or vessels are absent or abnormal       Treatment can help control symptoms. It includes exercise, compression devices, skin care, and massage.    NIH: National Cancer Institute\", 'Cold sores are caused by a contagious virus called herpes simplex virus (HSV). There are two types of HSV. Type 1 usually causes oral herpes, or cold sores. Type 1 herpes virus infects more than half of the U.S. population by the time they reach their 20s. Type 2 usually affects the genital area     Some people have no symptoms from the infection. But others develop painful and unsightly cold sores. Cold sores usually occur outside the mouth, on or around the lips. When they are inside the mouth, they are usually on the gums or the roof of the mouth. They are not the same as canker sores, which are not contagious.    There is no cure for cold sores. They normally go away on their own in a few weeks. Antiviral medicines can help them heal faster. They can also help to prevent cold sores in people who often get them. Other medicines can help with the pain and discomfort of the sores. These include ointments that numb the blisters, soften the crusts of the sores, or dry them out. Protecting your lips from the sun with sunblock lip balm can also help.', 'Leukemia is cancer of the white blood cells. White blood cells help your body fight infection. Your blood cells form in your bone marrow. In leukemia, the bone marrow produces abnormal white blood cells. These cells crowd out the healthy blood cells, making it hard for blood to do its work. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), there are too many lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell.    CLL is the second most common type of leukemia in adults. It often occurs during or after middle age, and is rare in children.    Usually CLL does not cause any symptoms. If you have symptoms, they may include       - Painless swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck, underarm, stomach, or groin    - Fatigue    - Pain or a feeling of fullness below the ribs    - Fever and infection    - Weight loss       Tests that examine the blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes diagnose CLL. Your doctor may choose to just monitor you until symptoms appear or change. Treatments include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, surgery to remove the spleen, and targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells.    NIH: National Cancer Institute']}"}, "time": 1746283466.685569}
