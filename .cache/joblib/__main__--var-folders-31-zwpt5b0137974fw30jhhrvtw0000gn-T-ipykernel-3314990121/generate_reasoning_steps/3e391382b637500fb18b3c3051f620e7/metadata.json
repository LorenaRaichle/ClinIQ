These tumors develop from a type of cell called a Schwann cell, which gives these tumors their name. They are usually benign (not cancerous). Although schwannomas can arise from any nerve in the body, the most common areas include the nerves of the head and neck and those involved with moving the arms and legs. Common symptoms include a slow-growing mass and Tinel's sign (an electric-like shock when the affected area is touched). The cause of schwannomas is unknown, but they sometimes occur in people with certain disorders including some types of neurofibromatosis. Benign schwannomas are typically treated with surgery.\", 'What are the signs and symptoms of schwannomas? Common signs and symptoms of schwannomas include a slow-growing mass and Tinel shock (electric-like shock when affected area is touched). Some people may experience numbness or other neurological symptoms depending on the size and location of the tumor.', 'What causes schwannomas? The cause of schwannomas is unknown. They sometimes occur in people with certain disorders including some types of neurofibromatosis (neurofibromatosis type 2 and schwannomatosis). In these cases, affected people have multiple tumors that are due to changes (mutations) in a gene. For example, neurofibromatosis type 2 is caused by mutations in the NF2 gene and schwannomatosis is caused by mutations in the SMARCB1 gene and the LZTR1 gene.', 'Are schwannomas inherited? Most schwannomas are not inherited. The vast majority of schwannomas occur by chance (sporadically) and as a single tumor. In these cases, people typically do not have affected family members. Around 5-10% of people develop multiple schwannomas. In these cases, the schwannomas may be due to an inherited condition which can be passed from parent to child. For example, neurofibromatosis type 2 and schwannomatosis are two conditions known to cause multiple schwannomas. Both of these conditions are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that to be affected, a person only needs a change (mutation) in one copy of the responsible gene in each cell. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from an affected parent. Other cases may result from new (de novo) mutations in the gene. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. A person with neurofibromatosis type 2 or schwannomatosis has a 50% chance with each pregnancy of passing along the altered gene to his or her child.']}"}, "time": 1746283458.461817}
