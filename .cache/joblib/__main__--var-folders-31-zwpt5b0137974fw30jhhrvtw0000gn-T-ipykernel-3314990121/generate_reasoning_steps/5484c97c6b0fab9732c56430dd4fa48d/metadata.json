Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', '5q14.3 microdeletion syndrome is characterized by severe intellectual disability, absent speech, stereotypic movements and epilepsy. Unusual facial features include high broad forehead with variable small chin, short nose with anteverted nares (nostrils that open to the front rather than downward), large open mouth, upslanted palpebral fissures (outside corners of the eyes that point downward), and prominent eyebrows. The condition is caused by mutations affecting the MEF2C gene and deletions in the q14.3 region of chromosome 5.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of 5q14.3 microdeletion syndrome ?
