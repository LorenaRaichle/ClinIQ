The sooner you start, the better your chances of preventing or delaying the condition.\\n                \\nFor People Who Have Healthy Hearts\\n                \\nIf you have a healthy heart, you can take action to prevent heart disease and heart failure. To reduce your risk of heart disease:\\n                \\nAvoid using illegal drugs.\\n                \\nBe physically active. The more active you are, the more you will benefit.\\n                \\nFollow a heart-healthy eating plan.\\n                \\nIf yousmoke, make an effort to quit. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.\\n                \\nMaintain a healthy weight. Work with your health care team to create a reasonable weight-loss plan.\\n                \\nFor People Who Are at High Risk for Heart Failure\\n                \\nEven if youre at high risk for heart failure, you can take steps to reduce your risk. People at high risk include those who have coronary heart disease,high blood pressure, ordiabetes.\\n                \\nFollow all of the steps listed above. Talk with your doctor about what types and amounts of physical activity are safe for you.\\n                \\nTreat and control any conditions that can cause heart failure. Take medicines as your doctor prescribes.\\n                \\nAvoid drinking alcohol.\\n                \\nSee your doctor for ongoing care.\\n                \\nFor People Who Have Heart Damage but No Signs of Heart Failure\\n                \\nIf you have heart damage but no signs of heart failure, you can still reduce your risk of developing the condition. In addition to the steps above, take your medicines as prescribed to reduce your hearts workload.', 'Thrombocythemia (THROM-bo-si-THE-me-ah) and thrombocytosis (THROM-bo-si-TO-sis) are conditions in which your blood has a higher than normal number of platelets (PLATE-lets).\\n                \\nPlatelets are blood cell fragments. They\\'re made in your bone marrow along with other kinds of blood cells.\\n                \\nPlatelets travel through your blood vessels and stick together (clot). Clotting helps stop any bleeding that may occur if a blood vessel is damaged. Platelets also are called thrombocytes (THROM-bo-sites) because a blood clot also is called a thrombus.\\n                \\nA normal platelet count ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nThe term \"thrombocythemia\" is preferred when the cause of a high platelet count isn\\'t known. The condition sometimes is called primary or essential thrombocythemia.\\n                \\nThis condition occurs if faulty cells in the bone marrow make too many platelets. Bone marrow is the sponge-like tissue inside the bones. It contains stem cells that develop into red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. What causes the bone marrow to make too many platelets often isn\\'t known.\\n                \\nWith primary thrombocythemia, a high platelet count may occur alone or with other blood cell disorders. This condition isn\\'t common.\\n                \\nWhen another disease or condition causes a high platelet count, the term \"thrombocytosis\" is preferred. This condition often is called secondary or reactive thrombocytosis. Secondary thrombocytosis is more common than primary thrombocythemia.\\n                \\nOften, a high platelet count doesn\\'t cause signs or symptoms. Rarely, serious or life-threatening symptoms can develop, such as blood clots and bleeding. These symptoms are more likely to occur in people who have primary thrombocythemia.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nPeople who have primary thrombocythemia with no signs or symptoms don\\'t need treatment, as long as the condition remains stable.\\n                \\nOther people who have this condition may need medicines or procedures to treat it. Most people who have primary thrombocythemia will live a normal lifespan.\\n                \\nTreatment and outlook for secondary thrombocytosis depend on its underlying cause.', 'Primary Thrombocythemia\\n                \\nIn this condition, faulty stem cells in the bone marrow make too many platelets. What causes this to happen usually isn\\'t known. When this process occurs without other blood cell disorders, it\\'s called essential thrombocythemia.\\n                \\nA rare form of thrombocythemia is inherited. (\"Inherited\" means the condition is passed from parents to children through the genes.) In some cases, a genetic mutation may cause the condition.\\n                \\nIn addition to the bone marrow making too many platelets, the platelets also are abnormal in primary thrombocythemia. They may form blood clots or, surprisingly, cause bleeding when they don\\'t work well.\\n                \\nBleeding also can occur because of a condition that develops called von Willebrand disease. This condition affects the blood clotting process.\\n                \\nAfter many years, scarring of the bone marrow can occur.\\n                \\nSecondary Thrombocytosis\\n                \\nThis condition occurs if another disease, condition, or outside factor causes the platelet count to rise. For example, 35 percent of people who have high platelet counts also have cancermostly lung, gastrointestinal, breast, ovarian, and lymphoma. Sometimes a high platelet count is the first sign of cancer.\\n                \\nOther conditions or factors that can cause a high platelet count are:\\n                \\nIron-deficiency anemia (uh-NEE-me-uh)\\n                \\nHemolytic (HEE-moh-lit-ick) anemia\\n                \\nAbsence of a spleen (after surgery to remove the organ)\\n                \\nInflammatory or infectious diseases, such as connective tissue disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, and tuberculosis\\n                \\nReactions to medicine\\n                \\nSome conditions can lead to a high platelet count that lasts for only a short time. Examples of such conditions include:\\n                \\nRecovery from serious blood loss\\n                \\nRecovery from a very low platelet count caused by excessive alcohol use and lack of vitamin B12 or folate\\n                \\nAcute (short-term) infection or inflammation\\n                \\nResponse to physical activity\\n                \\nAlthough the platelet count is high in secondary thrombocytosis, the platelets are normal (unlike in primary thrombocythemia). Thus, people who have secondary thrombocytosis have a lower risk of blood clots and bleeding.', 'Primary Thrombocythemia\\n                \\nThrombocythemia isn\\'t common. The exact number of people who have the condition isn\\'t known. Some estimates suggest that 24 out of every 100,000 people have primary thrombocythemia.\\n                \\nPrimary thrombocythemia is more common in people aged 50 to 70, but it can occur at any age. For unknown reasons, more women around the age of 30 have primary thrombocythemia than men of the same age.\\n                \\nSecondary Thrombocytosis\\n                \\nYou might be at risk for secondary thrombocytosis if you have a disease, condition, or factor that can cause it. (For more information, go to \"What Causes Thrombocythemia and Thrombocytosis?\")\\n                \\nSecondary thrombocytosis is more common than primary thrombocythemia. Studies have shown that most people who have platelet counts over 500,000 have secondary thrombocytosis.']}"}, "time": 1746283465.674967}
