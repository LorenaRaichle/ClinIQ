Public health departments can then investigate to determine if a restaurant, oyster bed, or fishing area has a problem. This prevents other illnesses. In any food poisoning occurrence, consumers should note foods eaten and freeze any uneaten portions in case they need to be tested. A commercial test has been developed in Hawaii to allow persons to test sport caught fish for ciguatoxins.', 'Loiasis is an infection caused by the parasitic worm Loa loa.', 'Loa loa parasites are found in West and Central Africa. Ten countries have areas where there are high rates of infection (i.e., where more than 40% of the people who live in that area report that they have had eye worm in the past). An estimated 14.4 million people live in these areas of high rates of infection. Another 15.2 live in areas where 20\u201340% of people report that they have had eye worm in the past.\\n    \\nMore on: Where Loa Loa is Prevelant [WHO Map]\\n    \\nThe people most at risk for loiasis are those who live in the certain rain forests in West and Central Africa. The deerflies that pass the parasite to humans usually bite during the day and are more common during the rainy season. They are attracted by the movement of people and by smoke from wood fires. Rubber plantations are areas where more deerflies may be found. The flies do not typically enter homes, but they might be attracted to homes that are well lit.\\n    \\nTravelers are more likely to become infected if they are in areas where they are bitten by deerflies for many months, though occasionally they get infected even if they are in an affected area for less than 30 days.\\n    \\nYour risk of infection depends on the number of bites received, the number of infected deerflies in the area you visit, and the length of your stay in the area.', 'In people who have been bitten by the flies that carry Loa loa in areas where Loa loa is known to exist, the diagnosis can be made in the following ways:\\n  \\n   - Identification of the adult worm by a microbiologist or pathologist after its removal from under the skin or eye\\n   - Identification of an adult worm in the eye by a health care provider\\n   - Identification of the microfilariae on a blood smear made from blood taken from the patient between 10AM and 2PM\\n   - Identification of antibodies against L. loa on specialized blood test\\n  \\n  \\nDiagnosis of loiasis can be difficult, especially in light infections where there are very few microfilariae in the blood. The specialized blood test is not widely available in the United States. A positive antibody blood test in someone with no symptoms means only that the person was infected sometime in his/her life. It does not mean that the person still has living parasites in his/her body.']}"}, "time": 1746283483.869154}
