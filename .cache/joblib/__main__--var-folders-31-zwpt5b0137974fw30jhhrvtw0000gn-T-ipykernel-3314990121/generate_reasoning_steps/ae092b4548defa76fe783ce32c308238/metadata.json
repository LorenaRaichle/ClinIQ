Most affected individuals experience progressive loss of kidney function, usually resulting in end-stage kidney disease. People with Alport syndrome also frequently develop sensorineural hearing loss in late childhood or early adolescence. The eye abnormalities seen in this condition seldom lead to vision loss. In 80% of cases, Alport syndrome is inherited in an X-linked manner and is caused by mutations in the COL4A5 gene. In the remaining cases, it may be inherited in either an autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant manner and caused by mutations in the COL4A3 or COL4A4 genes. Treatment may include use of a hearing aid; hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis to treat those with end-stage renal failure; and kidney transplantation.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Alport syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Alport syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Glomerulopathy 90% Retinopathy 90% Sensorineural hearing impairment 90% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the lens 50% Aseptic leukocyturia 50% Cataract 50% Dry skin 50% Edema of the lower limbs 50% Hypertension 50% Migraine 50% Nephrotic syndrome 50% Pallor 50% Periorbital edema 50% Proteinuria 50% Renal insufficiency 50% Respiratory insufficiency 50% Tinnitus 50% Weight loss 50% Abdominal situs inversus 7.5% Abnormality of the macula 7.5% Corneal dystrophy 7.5% Feeding difficulties in infancy 7.5% Myopia 7.5% Nausea and vomiting 7.5% Neoplasm of the colon 7.5% Photophobia 7.5% Sarcoma 7.5% Thrombocytopenia 7.5% Uterine neoplasm 7.5% Anterior lenticonus - Congenital cataract - Corneal erosion - Diffuse glomerular basement membrane lamellation - Diffuse leiomyomatosis - Heterogeneous - Hypoparathyroidism - Ichthyosis - Microscopic hematuria - Nephritis - Progressive - Stage 5 chronic kidney disease - X-linked dominant inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What causes Alport syndrome? Alport syndrome may be caused by mutations in either the COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 genes. These genes each provide instructions for making one component of a protein called type IV collagen, which plays an important role in the glomeruli of the kidneys. Glomeruli are clusters of specialized blood vessels that remove water and waste products from the blood and create urine. Mutations in the genes mentioned above result in abnormalities of the type IV collagen in glomeruli, which prevents the kidneys from properly filtering the blood. As a result, blood and protein pass into the urine. Over time, the kidneys become scarred and many people with Alport syndrome develop kidney failure. Type IV collagen is also an important component of the organ of Corti, an inner ear structure that transforms sound waves into nerve impulses for the brain. Alterations in type IV collagen may result in abnormal inner ear function, which can lead to hearing loss. In addition, type IV collagen plays a role in the eye, where it helps maintain the shape of the lens and the normal color of the retina. Mutations found in Alport syndrome may affect the shape of the lenses and the color of the retina.', 'How is Alport syndrome inherited? Alport syndrome can have different inheritance patterns. About 80 percent of cases are caused by mutations in the COL4A5 gene and are inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. This gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the COL4A5 gene in each cell is sufficient to cause kidney failure and other severe symptoms of the disorder. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation in only one copy of the COL4A5 gene usually only results in hematuria, but some women experience more severe symptoms. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.']}"}, "time": 1746283456.513331}
