Following special diets usually does not help improve the disorder. However, eating frequent, small meals with pureed foods or liquids may ease digestion. Vitamin and trace mineral supplements may help a person who is malnourished.', '- Intestinal pseudo-obstruction is a rare condition with symptoms that resemble those caused by a blockage, or obstruction, of the intestines, also called the bowel. However, when a health care provider examines the intestines, no blockage exists. Instead, the symptoms are due to nerve or muscle problems that affect the movement of food, fluid, and air through the intestines.  - Intestinal pseudo-obstruction symptoms may include abdominal swelling or bloating, also called distension; abdominal pain; nausea; vomiting; constipation; and diarrhea. Over time, the condition can cause malnutrition, bacterial overgrowth in the intestines, and weight loss.  - To diagnose intestinal pseudo-obstruction, a health care provider may suggest the person consult a gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseases. A health care provider will perform a physical exam; take a complete medical history, imaging studies, and a biopsy; and perform blood tests. A health care provider may order other tests to confirm the diagnosis.  - A health care provider will treat intestinal pseudo-obstruction with nutritional support, medications, and, in some cases, decompression. Rarely, a person will need surgery. If an illness, a medication, or both cause intestinal pseudo-obstruction, a health care provider will treat the underlying illness, stop the medication, or do both. A health care provider may recommend small intestine transplantation when all other treatments have failed.', 'The following chart shows the most common mouth problems from diabetes.\\n                \\n\\n                \\n      Problem          What It Is         Symptoms         Treatment           gingivitis              - unhealthy or inflamed gums                   - red, swollen, and bleeding gums                   - daily brushing and flossing      - regular cleanings at the dentist                periodontitis              - gum disease, which can change from mild to severe                   - red, swollen, and bleeding gums      - gums that have pulled away from the teeth      - long-lasting infection between the teeth and gums      - bad breath that wont go away      - permanent teeth that are loose or moving away from one another      - changes in the way your teeth fit together when you bite      - sometimes pus between the teeth and gums      - changes in the fit of dentures, which are teeth you can remove                   - deep cleaning at your dentist      - medicine that your dentist prescribes      - gum surgery in severe cases                thrush, called candidiasis              - the growth of a naturally occurring fungus that the body is unable to control                   - sore, whiteor sometimes redpatches on your gums, tongue, cheeks, or the roof of your mouth      - patches that have turned into open sores                   - medicine that your doctor or dentist prescribes to kill the fungus      - cleaning dentures      - removing dentures for part of the day or night, and soaking them in medicine that your doctor or dentist prescribes                dry mouth, called xerostomia              - a lack of saliva in your mouth, which raises your risk for tooth decay and gum disease                   - dry feeling in your mouth, often or all of the time      - dry, rough tongue      - pain in the mouth      - cracked lips      - mouth sores or infection      - problems chewing, eating, swallowing, or talking                   - taking medicine to keep your mouth wet that your doctor or dentist prescribes      - rinsing with afluoride mouth rinse to prevent cavities      - using sugarless gum or mints to increase saliva flow      - taking frequent sips of water      - avoiding tobacco, caffeine, and alcoholic beverages      - using ahumidifier,a device that raises the level of moisture in your home, at night      - avoiding spicy or salty foods that may cause pain in a dry mouth                oral burning              - a burning sensation inside the mouth caused by uncontrolled blood glucose levels                   - burning feeling in the mouth      - dry mouth      - bitter taste      - symptoms may worsen throughout the day                   - seeing your doctor, who may change your diabetes medicine      - once your blood glucose is under control, the oral burning will go away\\n                \\n\\n                \\n\\n                \\nMore symptoms of a problem in your mouth are   - a sore, or an ulcer, that does not heal   - dark spots or holes in your teeth   - pain in your mouth, face, or jaw that doesnt go away   - loose teeth   - pain when chewing   - a changed sense of taste or a bad taste in your mouth   - bad breath that doesnt go away when you brush your teeth', 'Diabetes is a complex group of diseases with a variety of causes. People with diabetes have high blood glucose, also called high blood sugar or hyperglycemia.\\n                \\nDiabetes is a disorder of metabolismthe way the body uses digested food for energy. The digestive tract breaks down carbohydratessugars and starches found in many foodsinto glucose, a form of sugar that enters the bloodstream. With the help of the hormone insulin, cells throughout the body absorb glucose and use it for energy. Diabetes develops when the body doesnt make enough insulin or is not able to use insulin effectively, or both.\\n                \\nInsulin is made in the pancreas, an organ located behind the stomach. The pancreas contains clusters of cells called islets. Beta cells within the islets make insulin and release it into the blood.\\n                \\nIf beta cells dont produce enough insulin, or the body doesnt respond to the insulin that is present, glucose builds up in the blood instead of being absorbed by cells in the body, leading to prediabetes or diabetes. Prediabetes is a condition in which blood glucose levels or A1C levelswhich reflect average blood glucose levelsare higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. In diabetes, the bodys cells are starved of energy despite high blood glucose levels.\\n                \\nOver time, high blood glucose damages nerves and blood vessels, leading to complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, blindness, dental disease, and amputations. Other complications of diabetes may include increased susceptibility to other diseases, loss of mobility with aging, depression, and pregnancy problems. No one is certain what starts the processes that cause diabetes, but scientists believe genes and environmental factors interact to cause diabetes in most cases.\\n                \\nThe two main types of diabetes are type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. A third type, gestational diabetes, develops only during pregnancy. Other types of diabetes are caused by defects in specific genes, diseases of the pancreas, certain drugs or chemicals, infections, and other conditions. Some people show signs of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.']}"}, "time": 1746283484.874648}
