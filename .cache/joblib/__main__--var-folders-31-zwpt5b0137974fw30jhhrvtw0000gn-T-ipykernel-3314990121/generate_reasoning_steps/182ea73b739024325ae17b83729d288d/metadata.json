Secretory glands include glands that make mucus and sweat.\\n                \\n\"Inherited\" means the disease is passed from parents to children through genes. People who have CF inherit two faulty genes for the diseaseone from each parent. The parents likely don\\'t have the disease themselves.\\n                \\nCF mainly affects the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestines, sinuses, and sex organs.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nMucus is a substance made by tissues that line some organs and body cavities, such as the lungs and nose. Normally, mucus is a slippery, watery substance. It keeps the linings of certain organs moist and prevents them from drying out or getting infected.\\n                \\nIf you have CF, your mucus becomes thick and sticky. It builds up in your lungs and blocks your airways. (Airways are tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs.)\\n                \\nThe buildup of mucus makes it easy for bacteria to grow. This leads to repeated, serious lung infections. Over time, these infections can severely damage your lungs.\\n                \\nThe thick, sticky mucus also can block tubes, or ducts, in your pancreas (an organ in your abdomen). As a result, the digestive enzymes that your pancreas makes can\\'t reach your small intestine.\\n                \\nThese enzymes help break down food. Without them, your intestines can\\'t fully absorb fats and proteins. This can cause vitamin deficiency and malnutrition because nutrients pass through your body without being used. You also may have bulky stools, intestinal gas, a swollen belly from severe constipation, and pain or discomfort.\\n                \\nCF also causes your sweat to become very salty. Thus, when you sweat, you lose large amounts of salt. This can upset the balance of minerals in your blood and cause many health problems. Examples of these problems include dehydration (a lack of fluid in your body), increased heart rate, fatigue (tiredness), weakness, decreased blood pressure, heat stroke, and, rarely, death.\\n                \\nIf you or your child has CF, you\\'re also at higher risk for diabetes or two bone-thinning conditions called osteoporosis (OS-te-o-po-RO-sis) and osteopenia (OS-te-o-PEE-nee-uh).\\n                \\nCF also causes infertility in men, and the disease can make it harder for women to get pregnant. (The term \"infertility\" refers to the inability to have children.)\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nThe symptoms and severity of CF vary. If you or your child has the disease, you may have serious lung and digestive problems. If the disease is mild, symptoms may not show up until the teen or adult years.\\n                \\nThe symptoms and severity of CF also vary over time. Sometimes you\\'ll have few symptoms. Other times, your symptoms may become more severe. As the disease gets worse, you\\'ll have more severe symptoms more often.\\n                \\nLung function often starts to decline in early childhood in people who have CF. Over time, damage to the lungs can cause severe breathing problems. Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death in people who have CF.\\n                \\nAs treatments for CF continue to improve, so does life expectancy for those who have the disease. Today, some people who have CF are living into their forties or fifties, or longer.\\n                \\nEarly treatment for CF can improve your quality of life and increase your lifespan. Treatments may include nutritional and respiratory therapies, medicines, exercise, and other treatments.\\n                \\nYour doctor also may recommend pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems.', 'A defect in the CFTR gene causes cystic fibrosis (CF). This gene makes a protein that controls the movement of salt and water in and out of your body\\'s cells. In people who have CF, the gene makes a protein that doesn\\'t work well. This causes thick, sticky mucus and very salty sweat.\\n                \\nResearch suggests that the CFTR protein also affects the body in other ways. This may help explain other symptoms and complications of CF.\\n                \\nMore than a thousand known defects can affect the CFTR gene. The type of defect you or your child has may affect the severity of CF. Other genes also may play a role in the severity of the disease.\\n                \\nHow Is Cystic Fibrosis Inherited?\\n                \\nEvery person inherits two CFTR genesone from each parent. Children who inherit a faulty CFTR gene from each parent will have CF.\\n                \\nChildren who inherit one faulty CFTR gene and one normal CFTR gene are \"CF carriers.\" CF carriers usually have no symptoms of CF and live normal lives. However, they can pass the faulty CFTR gene to their children.\\n                \\nThe image below shows how two parents who are both CF carriers can pass the faulty CFTR gene to their children.\\n                \\nExample of an Inheritance Pattern for Cystic Fibrosis', \"Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects both males and females and people from all racial and ethnic groups. However, the disease is most common among Caucasians of Northern European descent.\\n                \\nCF also is common among Latinos and American Indians, especially the Pueblo and Zuni. The disease is less common among African Americans and Asian Americans.\\n                \\nMore than 10 million Americans are carriers of a faulty CF gene. Many of them don't know that they're CF carriers.\", \"The signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis (CF) vary from person to person and over time. Sometimes you'll have few symptoms. Other times, your symptoms may become more severe.\\n                \\nOne of the first signs of CF that parents may notice is that their baby's skin tastes salty when kissed, or the baby doesn't pass stool when first born.\\n                \\nMost of the other signs and symptoms of CF happen later. They're related to how CF affects the respiratory, digestive, or reproductive systems of the body.\\n                \\nCystic Fibrosis\\n                \\n\\n                \\nRespiratory System Signs and Symptoms\\n                \\nPeople who have CF have thick, sticky mucus that builds up in their airways. This buildup of mucus makes it easier for bacteria to grow and cause infections. Infections can block the airways and cause frequent coughing that brings up thick sputum (spit) or mucus that's sometimes bloody.\\n                \\nPeople who have CF tend to have lung infections caused by unusual germs that don't respond to standard antibiotics. For example, lung infections caused by bacteria called mucoid Pseudomonas are much more common in people who have CF than in those who don't. An infection caused by these bacteria may be a sign of CF.\\n                \\nPeople who have CF have frequent bouts of sinusitis (si-nu-SI-tis), an infection of the sinuses. The sinuses are hollow air spaces around the eyes, nose, and forehead. Frequent bouts of bronchitis (bron-KI-tis) and pneumonia (nu-MO-ne-ah) also can occur. These infections can cause long-term lung damage.\\n                \\nAs CF gets worse, you may have more serious problems, such as pneumothorax (noo-mo-THOR-aks) or bronchiectasis (brong-ke-EK-ta-sis).\\n                \\nSome people who have CF also develop nasal polyps (growths in the nose) that may require surgery.\\n                \\nDigestive System Signs and Symptoms\\n                \\nIn CF, mucus can block tubes, or ducts, in your pancreas (an organ in your abdomen). These blockages prevent enzymes from reaching your intestines.\\n                \\nAs a result, your intestines can't fully absorb fats and proteins. This can cause ongoing diarrhea or bulky, foul-smelling, greasy stools. Intestinal blockages also may occur, especially in newborns. Too much gas or severe constipation in the intestines may cause stomach pain and discomfort.\\n                \\nA hallmark of CF in children is poor weight gain and growth. These children are unable to get enough nutrients from their food because of the lack of enzymes to help absorb fats and proteins.\\n                \\nAs CF gets worse, other problems may occur, such as:\\n                \\nPancreatitis (PAN-kre-ah-TI-tis). This is a condition in which the pancreas become inflamed, which causes pain.\\n                \\nRectal prolapse. Frequent coughing or problems passing stools may cause rectal tissue from inside you to move out of your rectum.\\n                \\nLiver disease due to inflamed or blocked bile ducts.\\n                \\nDiabetes.\\n                \\nGallstones.\\n                \\nReproductive System Signs and Symptoms\\n                \\nMen who have CF are infertile because they're born without a vas deferens. The vas deferens is a tube that delivers sperm from the testes to the penis.\\n                \\nWomen who have CF may have a hard time getting pregnant because of mucus blocking the cervix or other CF complications.\\n                \\nOther Signs, Symptoms, and Complications\\n                \\nOther signs and symptoms of CF are related to an upset of the balance of minerals in your blood.\\n                \\nCF causes your sweat to become very salty. As a result, your body loses large amounts of salt when you sweat. This can cause dehydration (a lack of fluid in your body), increased heart rate, fatigue (tiredness), weakness, decreased blood pressure, heat stroke, and, rarely, death.\\n                \\nCF also can cause clubbing and low bone density. Clubbing is the widening and rounding of the tips of your fingers and toes. This sign develops late in CF because your lungs aren't moving enough oxygen into your bloodstream.\\n                \\nLow bone density also tends to occur late in CF. It can lead to bone-thinning disorders called osteoporosis and osteopenia.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283465.646602}
