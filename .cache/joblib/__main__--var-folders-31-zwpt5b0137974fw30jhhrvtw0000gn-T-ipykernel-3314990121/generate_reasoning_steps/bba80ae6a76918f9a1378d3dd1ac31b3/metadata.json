The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for GM1 gangliosidosis type 2. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the face - Abnormality of the liver - Abnormality of the spleen - Ataxia - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Cerebral atrophy - Coxa valga - Gait disturbance - Generalized myoclonic seizures - Optic atrophy - Platyspondyly - Progressive psychomotor deterioration - Sea-blue histiocytosis - Spastic tetraplegia - Ventriculomegaly - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Leiomyosarcoma is a rare cancerous tumor that consists of smooth (involuntary) muscle cells. Leiomyosarcoma is a type of sarcoma. It spreads through the blood stream and can affect the lungs, liver, blood vessels, or any other soft tissue in the body. The exact cause of leiomyosarcoma is not known, although genetic and environmental factors appear to be involved. It is most often found in the uterus or abdomen.', 'How might leiomyosarcoma be treated? Treatment of leiomyosarcoma varies depending on the location and stage of the cancer. Surgery is typically the first choice for treatment, however, chemotherapy, targeted drugs, radiation therapy, and hormonal therapy may also be used to treat leiomyosarcoma. Additional information on the treatment of intestinal leiomyosarcoma is available from Medscape Reference.

In some individuals, facial muscles may also be affected. While the progression varies from case to case, it tends to be relatively slow. Some cases of scapuloperoneal myopathy are caused by mutations in the MYH7 gene. Autosomal dominant inheritance is suggested in these cases. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.']}"}, "time": 1746283455.1187599}
