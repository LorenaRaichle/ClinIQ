Criteria for diagnosis include : Severe itching, prickling, stinging, or burning that consistently develops after skin contact with water, regardless of water temperature or salinity; Lack of visible skin manifestations; Reaction within minutes of exposure and lasting anywhere between 10 minutes to 2 hours; Lack of a other skin disease, internal condition, or medication to account for the reaction; and Exclusion of all other physical urticarias, symptomatic dermographism, and polycythemia vera.', 'What treatment has been attempted in patients who have aquagenic pruritus? The underlying cause of aquagenic pruritus is not well understood which complicates the decision about what therapy might be best for treatment. Various options have been tried with varying success. Antihistamines are the mainstay of treatment. Other therapies that have been tried include adding adding sodium bicarbonate to bath water, topical capsaicin, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, UVB phototherapy, PUVA therapy, naltrexone, propranolol, and atenolol.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Tetramelic monodactyly? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Tetramelic monodactyly. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Split hand 90% Autosomal dominant inheritance - Monodactyly (feet) - Monodactyly (hands) - Split foot - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Deafness and myopia syndrome is rare condition that affects both hearing and vision. Beginning at birth or in early infancy, people with this condition have moderate to profound hearing loss in both ears that generally becomes worse over time. Affected people also develop severe myopia (nearsightedness) later in infancy or early childhood. Deafness and myopia syndrome is caused by changes (mutations) in the SLITRK6 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment aims to improve hearing loss and correct myopia. Cochlear implantation may be an option for some affected people.']}"}, "time": 1746283461.085557}
