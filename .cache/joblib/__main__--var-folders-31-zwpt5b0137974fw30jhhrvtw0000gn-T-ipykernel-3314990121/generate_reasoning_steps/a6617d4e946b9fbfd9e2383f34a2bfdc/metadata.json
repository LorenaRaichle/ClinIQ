But medicines can also cause harmful reactions if not used correctly. Errors can happen in the hospital, at the doctor's office, at the pharmacy, or at home. You can help prevent errors by       - Knowing your medicines. Keep a list of the names of your medicines, how much you take, and when you take them. Include over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and supplements and herbs. Take this list to all your doctor visits.    - Reading medicine labels and following the directions. Don't take medications prescribed for someone else.    - Taking extra caution when giving medicines to children.    - Asking questions. If you don't know the answers to these questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.         - Why am I taking this medicine?     - What are the common problems to watch out for?     - What should I do if they occur?     - When should I stop this medicine?     - Can I take this medicine with the other medicines on my list?           Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\", 'Your mind works a lot like a computer. Your brain puts information it judges to be important into \"files.\" When you remember something, you pull up a file. Memory doesn\\'t always work perfectly. As people grow older, it may take longer to retrieve those files. Some adults joke about having a \"senior moment.\"    It\\'s normal to forget things once in awhile. We\\'ve all forgotten a name, where we put our keys, or if we locked the front door. Seniors who forget things more often than others their age may have mild cognitive impairment. Forgetting how to use the telephone or find your way home may be signs of a more serious problem. These include Alzheimer\\'s disease or other types of dementia, stroke, depression, head injuries, thyroid problems, or reactions to certain medicines. If you\\'re worried about your forgetfulness, see your doctor.    NIH: National Institute on Aging', \"Managed care plans are a type of health insurance. They have contracts with health care providers and medical facilities to provide care for members at reduced costs. These providers make up the plan's network. How much of your care the plan will pay for depends on the network's rules.    Plans that restrict your choices usually cost you less. If you want a flexible plan, it will probably cost more. There are three types of managed care plans:       - Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO) usually only pay for care within the network. You choose a primary care doctor who coordinates most of your care.    - Preferred Provider Organizations (PPO) usually pay more if you get care within the network. They still pay part of the cost if you go outside the network.    - Point of Service (POS) plans let you choose between an HMO or a PPO each time you need care.\", 'Connective tissue is the material inside your body that supports many of its parts. It is the \"cellular glue\" that gives your tissues their shape and helps keep them strong. It also helps some of your tissues do their work. Cartilage and fat are examples of connective tissue.      There are over 200 disorders that impact connective tissue. Some, like cellulitis, are the result of an infection. Injuries can cause connective tissue disorders, such as scars. Others, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and osteogenesis imperfecta, are genetic. Still others, like scleroderma, have no known cause. Each disorder has its own symptoms and needs different treatment.']}"}, "time": 1746283467.661154}
