The autonomic nervous system is the part of our bodies that controls involuntary actions, such as the widening or narrowing of our blood vessels. Failure of this system can cause a variety of symptoms. The most common symptom of pure autonomic failure is orthostatic hypotension. Other symptoms may include decreased sweating, heat intolerance, inability to empty the bladder, erectile dysfunction, incontinence or constipation, and pupil changes. The cause of this condition is usually unknown.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Lopes Gorlin syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Lopes Gorlin syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Distichiasis 90% Photophobia 50% Absent lower eyelashes - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Hypoplasia of the lower eyelids - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of McDonough syndrome?
