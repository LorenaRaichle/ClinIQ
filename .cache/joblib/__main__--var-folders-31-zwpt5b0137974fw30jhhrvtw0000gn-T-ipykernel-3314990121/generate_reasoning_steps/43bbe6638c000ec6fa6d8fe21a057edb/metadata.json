The flaps of the valve are floppy and may not close tightly. These flaps normally help seal or open the valve.\\n                \\nMuch of the time, MVP doesnt cause any problems. Rarely, blood can leak the wrong way through the floppy valve. This can lead topalpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain, and other symptoms. (Palpitations are feelings that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, or beating too hard or too fast.)\\n                \\nNormal Mitral Valve\\n                \\nThe mitral valve controls blood flow between the upper and lower chambers of the left side of the heart. The upper chamber is called the left atrium. The lower chamber is called the left ventricle.\\n                \\nThe mitral valve allows blood to flow from the left atrium into the left ventricle, but not back the other way. The heart also has a right atrium and ventricle, separated by the tricuspid valve.\\n                \\nWith each heartbeat, the atria contract and push blood into the ventricles. The flaps of the mitral and tricuspid valves open to let blood through. Then, the ventricles contract to pump the blood out of the heart.\\n                \\nWhen the ventricles contract, the flaps of the mitral and tricuspid valves close. They form a tight seal that prevents blood from flowing back into the atria.\\n                \\nFor more information, go to the Health TopicsHow the Heart Worksarticle. This article contains animations that show how your heart pumps blood and how your hearts electrical system works.\\n                \\nMitral Valve Prolapse\\n                \\nIn MVP, when the left ventricle contracts, one or both flaps of the mitral valve flop or bulge back (prolapse) into the left atrium. This can prevent the valve from forming a tight seal. As a result, blood may leak from the ventricle back into the atrium. The backflow of blood is called regurgitation.\\n                \\nMVP doesnt always cause backflow. In fact, most people who have MVP dont have backflow and never have any related symptoms or problems. When backflow occurs, it can get worse over time and itcan change the hearts size and raise pressure in the left atrium and lungs. Backflow also raises the risk of heart valve infections.\\n                \\nMedicines can treat troublesome MVP symptoms and help prevent complications. Some people will need surgery to repair or replace their mitral valves.\\n                \\nMitral Valve Prolapse', 'The exact cause of mitral valve prolapse (MVP) isn\\'t known. Most people who have the condition are born with it. MVP tends to run in families. Also, it\\'s more common in people who are born with connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome.\\n                \\nIn people who have MVP, the mitral valve may be abnormal in the following ways:\\n                \\nThe valve flaps may be too large and thick.\\n                \\nThe valve flaps may be \"floppy.\" The tissue of the flaps and their supporting \"strings\" are too stretchy, and parts of the valve flop or bulge back into the atrium.\\n                \\nThe opening of the valve may stretch.\\n                \\nThese problems can keep the valve from making a tight seal. Some people\\'s valves are abnormal in more than one way.', 'Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) affects people of all ages and both sexes; however, aging raises the risk of developing the disease.\\n                \\nCertain conditions have been associated with MVP, including:\\n                \\nA history of rheumatic fever\\n                \\nConnective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome\\n                \\nGraves disease\\n                \\nScoliosis and other skeletal problems\\n                \\nSome types of muscular dystrophy', 'Most people who have mitral valve prolapse (MVP) aren\\'t affected by the condition. They don\\'t have any symptoms or major mitral valve backflow.\\n                \\nWhen MVP does cause signs and symptoms, they may include:\\n                \\nPalpitations (feelings that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, or beating too hard or too fast)\\n                \\nShortness of breath\\n                \\nCough\\n                \\nFatigue (tiredness), dizziness, or anxiety\\n                \\nMigraine headaches\\n                \\nChest discomfort\\n                \\nMVP symptoms can vary from one person to another. They tend to be mild but can worsen over time, mainly when complications occur.\\n                \\nMitral Valve Prolapse Complications\\n                \\nMVP complications are rare. When present, they\\'re most often caused by the backflow of blood through the mitral valve.\\n                \\nMitral valve backflow is most common among men and people who have high blood pressure. People who have severe backflow may need valve surgery to prevent complications.\\n                \\nMitral valve backflow causes blood to flow from the left ventricle back into the left atrium. Blood can even back up from the atrium into the lungs, causing shortness of breath.\\n                \\nThe backflow of blood strains the muscles of both the atrium and the ventricle. Over time, the strain can lead to arrhythmias. Backflow also increases the risk of infective endocarditis (IE). IE is an infection of the inner lining of your heart chambers and valves.\\n                \\nArrhythmias\\n                \\nArrhythmias are problems with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. The most common types of arrhythmias are harmless. Other arrhythmias can be serious or even life threatening, such as ventricular arrhythmias.\\n                \\nIf the heart rate is too slow, too fast, or irregular, the heart may not be able to pump enough blood to the body. Lack of blood flow can damage the brain, heart, and other organs.\\n                \\nOne troublesome arrhythmia that MVP can cause is atrial fibrillation (AF). In AF, the walls of the atria quiver instead of beating normally. As a result, the atria aren\\'t able to pump blood into the ventricles the way they should.\\n                \\nAF is bothersome but rarely life threatening, unless the atria contract very fast or blood clots form in the atria. Blood clots can occur because some blood \"pools\" in the atria instead of flowing into the ventricles. If a blood clot breaks off and travels through the bloodstream, it can reach the brain and cause a stroke.\\n                \\nInfection of the Mitral Valve\\n                \\nA deformed mitral valve flap can attract bacteria in the bloodstream. The bacteria attach to the valve and can cause a serious infection called infective endocarditis (IE). Signs and symptoms of a bacterial infection include fever, chills, body aches, and headaches.\\n                \\nIE doesn\\'t happen often, but when it does, it\\'s serious. MVP is the most common heart condition that puts people at risk for this infection.\\n                \\nIf you have MVP, you can take steps to prevent IE. Floss and brush your teeth regularly. Gum infections and tooth decay can cause IE.']}"}, "time": 1746283466.3865228}
