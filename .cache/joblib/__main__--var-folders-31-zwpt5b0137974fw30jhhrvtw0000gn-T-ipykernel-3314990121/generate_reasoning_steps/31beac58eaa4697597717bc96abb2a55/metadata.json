The development of organs such as the brain, heart, lungs, and kidneys may also be affected. Several cases in which milder signs and symptoms have been reported in the medical literature. The condition is caused by mutations in the NSDHL gene, a gene that provides instructions for the production of an enzyme involved in the making of cholesterol. CHILD syndrome is inherited in an X-linked dominant fashion and is almost exclusively found in females.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of CHILD syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for CHILD syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Cranioacrofacial syndrome?
