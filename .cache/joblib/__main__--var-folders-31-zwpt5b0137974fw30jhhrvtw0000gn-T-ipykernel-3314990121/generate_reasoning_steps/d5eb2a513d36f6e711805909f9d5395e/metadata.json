CCHD represents some of the most serious types of heart defects. About 7,200 newborns, or 18 per 10,000, in the United States are diagnosed with CCHD each year.', 'In most cases, the cause of CCHD is unknown. A variety of genetic and environmental factors likely contribute to this complex condition.  Changes in single genes have been associated with CCHD. Studies suggest that these genes are involved in normal heart development before birth. Most of the identified mutations reduce the amount or function of the protein that is produced from a specific gene, which likely impairs the normal formation of structures in the heart. Studies have also suggested that having more or fewer copies of particular genes compared with other people, a phenomenon known as copy number variation, may play a role in CCHD. However, it is unclear whether genes affected by copy number variation are involved in heart development and how having missing or extra copies of those genes could lead to heart defects. Researchers believe that single-gene mutations and copy number variation account for a relatively small percentage of all CCHD.  CCHD is usually isolated, which means it occurs alone (without signs and symptoms affecting other parts of the body). However, the heart defects associated with CCHD can also occur as part of genetic syndromes that have additional features. Some of these genetic conditions, such as Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, result from changes in the number or structure of particular chromosomes. Other conditions, including Noonan syndrome and Alagille syndrome, result from mutations in single genes.  Environmental factors may also contribute to the development of CCHD. Potential risk factors that have been studied include exposure to certain chemicals or drugs before birth, viral infections (such as rubella and influenza) that occur during pregnancy, and other maternal illnesses including diabetes and phenylketonuria. Although researchers are examining risk factors that may be associated with this complex condition, many of these factors remain unknown.', 'Most cases of CCHD are sporadic, which means they occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. However, close relatives (such as siblings) of people with CCHD may have an increased risk of being born with a heart defect compared with people in the general population.', \"These resources address the diagnosis or management of critical congenital heart disease:  - Baby's First Test: Critical Congenital Heart Disease  - Boston Children's Hospital  - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Screening for Critical Congenital Heart Defects  - Children's Hospital of Philadelphia  - Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center  - Cleveland Clinic  - Genetic Testing Registry: Congenital heart disease  - Genetic Testing Registry: Ebstein's anomaly  - Genetic Testing Registry: Hypoplastic left heart syndrome  - Genetic Testing Registry: Hypoplastic left heart syndrome 2  - Genetic Testing Registry: Persistent truncus arteriosus  - Genetic Testing Registry: Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum  - Genetic Testing Registry: Pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect  - Genetic Testing Registry: Tetralogy of Fallot  - Genetic Testing Registry: Transposition of the great arteries  - Genetic Testing Registry: Transposition of the great arteries, dextro-looped 2  - Genetic Testing Registry: Transposition of the great arteries, dextro-looped 3  - Genetic Testing Registry: Tricuspid atresia  - Screening, Technology, and Research in Genetics (STAR-G)  - University of California, San Francisco Fetal Treatment Center: Congenital Heart Disease   These resources from MedlinePlus offer information about the diagnosis and management of various health conditions:  - Diagnostic Tests  - Drug Therapy  - Surgery and Rehabilitation  - Genetic Counseling   - Palliative Care\"]}"}, "time": 1746283451.474323}
