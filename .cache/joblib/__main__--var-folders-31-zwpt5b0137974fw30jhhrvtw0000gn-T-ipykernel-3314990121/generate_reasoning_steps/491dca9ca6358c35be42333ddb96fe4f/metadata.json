Due to the rarity of Jones syndrome, there are no treatment guidelines available in the medical literature. However, there is information about how the features associated with Jones syndrome might be treated. Treatment for gingival fibromatosis varies depending on the severity. Maintaining good oral hygiene is very important. Surgery to remove the enlarged gum tissue in the mouth (gingivectomy) may be needed for functional and/or cosmetic reasons. Enlargement may recur to various extents, and repeated surgeries may be needed to reshape the gums. It has been recommended that whenever possible, this treatment should be performed after the complete eruption of permanent teeth. The goal of treatment for sensorineural hearing loss is to improve hearing. People with sensorineural hearing loss may use hearing aids; telephone amplifiers and other assistive devices; sign language (for those with severe hearing loss); and/or speech reading (such as lip reading and using visual cues to aid communication). A cochlear implant may be recommended for some people with severe hearing loss.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 4? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 4. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Hirsutism 5% Acanthosis nigricans - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Bradycardia - Constipation - Dysphagia - Elevated hepatic transaminases - Elevated serum creatine phosphokinase - Exercise intolerance - Failure to thrive - Feeding difficulties - Flexion contracture - Generalized muscle weakness - Hepatic steatosis - Hepatomegaly - Hyperinsulinemia - Hyperlordosis - Hypertriglyceridemia - IgA deficiency - Ileus - Infantile onset - Insulin resistance - Lipodystrophy - Muscle mounding - Muscle stiffness - Muscular dystrophy - Myalgia - Osteopenia - Osteoporosis - Prolonged QT interval - Prominent umbilicus - Proximal muscle weakness - Pyloric stenosis - Recurrent infections - Scoliosis - Skeletal muscle hypertrophy - Spinal rigidity - Splenomegaly - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Aganglionosis, total intestinal?

It is characterized by early-onset severe brain dysfunction (encephalopathy) that usually results in severe intellectual and physical disability. Additional symptoms may include epilepsy, painful, itchy skin lesion (chilblains), vision problems, and joint stiffness. Symptoms usually progress over several months before the disease course stabilizes. There are six different types of Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, which are distinguished by the gene that causes the condition: TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, SAMHD1, and ADAR genes. Most cases are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, although rare autosomal dominant cases have been reported. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.']}"}, "time": 1746283460.341179}
