People with SCD have abnormal hemoglobin, called hemoglobin S or sickle hemoglobin, in their red blood cells.\\n                \\nHemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body.\\n                \\nInherited means that the disease is passed by genes from parents to their children. SCD is not contagious. A person cannot catch it, like a cold or infection, from someone else.\\n                \\nPeople who have SCD inherit two abnormal hemoglobin genes, one from each parent. In all forms of SCD, at least one of the two abnormal genes causes a persons body to make hemoglobin S. When a person has two hemoglobin S genes, Hemoglobin SS, the disease is called sickle cell anemia. This is the most common and often most severe kind of SCD.\\n                \\nHemoglobin SC disease and hemoglobin S thalassemia (thal-uh-SEE-me-uh) are two other common forms of SCD.\\n                \\nSome Forms of Sickle Cell Disease\\n                \\nHemoglobin SS\\n                \\nHemoglobin SC\\n                \\nHemoglobin S0 thalassemia\\n                \\nHemoglobin S+ thalassemia\\n                \\nHemoglobin SD\\n                \\nHemoglobin SE\\n                \\n\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nCells in tissues need a steady supply of oxygen to work well. Normally, hemoglobin in red blood cells takes up oxygen in the lungs and carries it to all the tissues of the body.\\n                \\nRed blood cells that contain normal hemoglobin are disc shaped (like a doughnut without a hole). This shape allows the cells to be flexible so that they can move through large and small blood vessels to deliver oxygen.\\n                \\nSickle hemoglobin is not like normal hemoglobin. It can form stiff rods within the red cell, changing it into a crescent, or sickle shape.\\n                \\nSickle-shaped cells are not flexible and can stick to vessel walls, causing a blockage that slows or stops the flow of blood. When this happens, oxygen cant reach nearby tissues.\\n                \\nNormal Red Cells and Sickle Red Cells\\n                \\n\\n                \\nThe lack of tissue oxygen can cause attacks of sudden, severe pain, called pain crises. These pain attacks can occur without warning, and a person often needs to go to the hospital for effective treatment.\\n                \\nMost children with SCD are pain free between painful crises, but adolescents and adults may also suffer with chronic ongoing pain.\\n                \\nThe red cell sickling and poor oxygen delivery can also cause organ damage. Over a lifetime, SCD can harm a persons spleen, brain, eyes, lungs, liver, heart, kidneys, penis, joints, bones, or skin.\\n                \\nSickle cells cant change shape easily, so they tend to burst apart or hemolyze. Normal red blood cells live about 90 to 120 days, but sickle cells last only 10 to 20 days.\\n                \\nThe body is always making new red blood cells to replace the old cells; however, in SCD the body may have trouble keeping up with how fast the cells are being destroyed. Because of this, the number of red blood cells is usually lower than normal. This condition, called anemia, can make a person have less energy.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nSickle cell disease is a life-long illness. The severity of the disease varies widely from person to person.\\n                \\nIn high-income countries like the United States, the life expectancy of a person with SCD is now about 4060 years. In 1973, the average lifespan of a person with SCD in the United States was only 14 years. Advances in the diagnosis and care of SCD have made this improvement possible.\\n                \\nAt the present time, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only cure for SCD. Unfortunately, most people with SCD are either too old for a transplant or dont have a relative who is a good enough genetic match for them to act as a donor. A well-matched donor is needed to have the best chance for a successful transplant.\\n                \\nThere are effective treatments that can reduce symptoms and prolong life. Early diagnosis and regular medical care to prevent complications also contribute to improved well-being.', 'Abnormal hemoglobin, called hemoglobin S, causes sickle cell disease (SCD).\\n                \\nThe problem in hemoglobin S is caused by a small defect in the gene that directs the production of the beta globin part of hemoglobin. This small defect in the beta globin gene causes a problem in the beta globin part of hemoglobin, changing the way that hemoglobin works. (See Overview.)\\n                \\n\\n                \\nHow Is Sickle Cell Disease Inherited?\\n                \\nWhen the hemoglobin S gene is inherited from only one parent and a normal hemoglobin gene is inherited from the other, a person will have sickle cell trait. People with sickle cell trait are generally healthy.\\n                \\nOnly rarely do people with sickle cell trait have complications similar to those seen in people with SCD. But people with sickle cell trait are carriers of a defective hemoglobin S gene. So, they can pass it on when they have a child.\\n                \\nIf the childs other parent also has sickle cell trait or another abnormal hemoglobin gene (like thalassemia, hemoglobin C, hemoglobin D, hemoglobin E), that child has a chance of having SCD.\\n                \\nExample of an Inheritance Pattern\\n                \\n\\n                \\nIn the image above, each parent has one hemoglobin A gene and one hemoglobin S gene, and each of their children has:\\n                \\nA 25 percent chance of inheriting two normal genes: In this case the child does not have sickle cell trait or disease. (Case 1)\\n                \\nA 50 percent chance of inheriting one hemoglobin A gene and one hemoglobin S gene: This child has sickle cell trait. (Cases 2 and 3)\\n                \\nA 25 percent chance of inheriting two hemoglobin S genes: This child has sickle cell disease. (Case 4)\\n                \\nIt is important to keep in mind that each time this couple has a child, the chances of that child having sickle cell disease remain the same. In other words, if the first-born child has sickle cell disease, there is still a 25 percent chance that the second child will also have the disease. Both boys and girls can inherit sickle cell trait, sickle cell disease, or normal hemoglobin.\\n                \\nIf a person wants to know if he or she carries a sickle hemoglobin gene, a doctor can order a blood test to find out.', 'In the United States, most people with sickle cell disease (SCD) are of African ancestry or identify themselves as black.\\n                \\nAbout 1 in 13 African American babies is born with sickle cell trait.\\n                \\nAbout 1 in every 365 black children is born with sickle cell disease.\\n                \\nThere are also many people with this disease who come from Hispanic, southern European, Middle Eastern, or Asian Indian backgrounds.\\n                \\nApproximately 100,000 Americans have SCD.', 'Early Signs and Symptoms\\n                \\nIf a person has sickle cell disease (SCD), it is present at birth. But most infants do not have any problems from the disease until they are about 5 or 6 months of age. Every state in the United States, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories requires that all newborn babies receive screening for SCD. When a child has SCD, parents are notified before the child has symptoms.\\n                \\nSome children with SCD will start to have problems early on, and some later. Early symptoms of SCD may include:\\n                \\nPainful swelling of the hands and feet, known as dactylitis\\n                \\nFatigue or fussiness from anemia\\n                \\nA yellowish color of the skin, known as jaundice, or whites of the eyes, known as icteris, that occurs when a large number of red cells hemolyze\\n                \\nThe signs and symptoms of SCD will vary from person to person and can change over time. Most of the signs and symptoms of SCD are related to complications of the disease.\\n                \\nMajor Complications of Sickle Cell Disease\\n                \\nAcute Pain (Sickle Cell or Vaso-occlusive) Crisis\\n                \\nPain episodes (crises) can occur without warning when sickle cells block blood flow and decrease oxygen delivery. People describe this pain as sharp, intense, stabbing, or throbbing. Severe crises can be even more uncomfortable than post-surgical pain or childbirth.\\n                \\nPain can strike almost anywhere in the body and in more than one spot at a time. But the pain often occurs in the\\n                \\nLower back\\n                \\nLegs\\n                \\nArms\\n                \\nAbdomen\\n                \\nChest\\n                \\nA crisis can be brought on by\\n                \\nIllness\\n                \\nTemperature changes\\n                \\nStress\\n                \\nDehydration (not drinking enough)\\n                \\nBeing at high altitudes\\n                \\nBut often a person does not know what triggers, or causes, the crisis. (See acute pain management.)\\n                \\nChronic Pain\\n                \\nMany adolescents and adults with SCD suffer from chronic pain. This kind of pain has been hard for people to describe, but it is usually different from crisis pain or the pain that results from organ damage.\\n                \\nChronic pain can be severe and can make life difficult. Its cause is not well understood. (See chronic pain management.)\\n                \\nSevere Anemia\\n                \\nPeople with SCD usually have mild to moderate anemia. At times, however, they can have severe anemia. Severe anemia can be life threatening. Severe anemia in an infant or child with SCD may be caused by:\\n                \\nSplenic sequestration crisis. The spleen is an organ that is located in the upper left side of the belly. The spleen filters germs in the blood, breaks up blood cells, and makes a kind of white blood cell. A splenic sequestration crisis occurs when red blood cells get stuck in the spleen, making it enlarge quickly. Since the red blood cells are trapped in the spleen, there are fewer cells to circulate in the blood. This causes severe anemia.  A big spleen may also cause pain in the left side of the belly. A parent can usuallypalpate or feel the enlarged spleen in the belly of his or her child.\\n                \\nA big spleen may also cause pain in the left side of the belly. A parent can usuallypalpate or feel the enlarged spleen in the belly of his or her child.\\n                \\nAplastic crisis. This crisis is usually caused by a parvovirus B19 infection, also called fifth disease or slapped cheek syndrome. Parvovirus B19 is a very common infection, but in SCD it can cause the bone marrow to stop producing new red cells for a while, leading to severe anemia.\\n                \\nSplenic sequestration crisis and aplastic crisis most commonly occur in infants and children with SCD. Adults with SCD may also experience episodes of severe anemia, but these usually have other causes.\\n                \\nNo matter the cause, severe anemia may lead to symptoms that include:\\n                \\nShortness of breath\\n                \\nBeing very tired\\n                \\nFeeling dizzy\\n                \\nHaving pale skin\\n                \\nBabies and infants with severe anemia may feed poorly and seem very sluggish. (See anemia management.)\\n                \\nInfections\\n                \\nThe spleen is important for protection against certain kinds of germs. Sickle cells can damage the spleen and weaken or destroy its function early in life.\\n                \\nPeople with SCD who have damaged spleens are at risk for serious bacterial infections that can be life-threatening. Some of these bacteria include:\\n                \\nPneumococcus\\n                \\nHemophilus influenza type B\\n                \\nMeningococcus\\n                \\nSalmonella\\n                \\nStaphylococcus\\n                \\nChlamydia\\n                \\nMycoplasma pneumoniae\\n                \\nBacteria can cause:\\n                \\nBlood infection (septicemia)\\n                \\nLung infection (pneumonia)\\n                \\nInfection of the covering of the brain and spinal cord (meningitis)\\n                \\nBone infection (osteomyelitis)\\n                \\n(See how to prevent infections and infection management.)\\n                \\nAcute Chest Syndrome\\n                \\nSickling in blood vessels of the lungs can deprive a persons lungs of oxygen. When this happens, areas of lung tissue are damaged and cannot exchange oxygen properly. This condition is known as acute chest syndrome. In acute chest syndrome, at least one segment of the lung is damaged.\\n                \\nThis condition is very serious and should be treated right away at a hospital.\\n                \\nAcute chest syndrome often starts a few days after a painful crisis begins. A lung infection may accompany acute chest syndrome.\\n                \\nSymptoms may include:\\n                \\nChest pain\\n                \\nFever\\n                \\nShortness of breath\\n                \\nRapid breathing\\n                \\nCough\\n                \\n(See acute chest syndrome management.)\\n                \\nBrain Complications\\n                \\nClinical Stroke\\n                \\nA stroke occurs when blood flow is blocked to a part of the brain. When this happens, brain cells can be damaged or can die. In SCD, a clinical stroke means that a person shows outward signs that something is wrong. The symptoms depend upon what part of the brain is affected. Symptoms of stroke may include:\\n                \\nWeakness of an arm or leg on one side of the body\\n                \\nTrouble speaking, walking, or understanding\\n                \\nLoss of balance\\n                \\nSevere headache\\n                \\nAs many as 24 percent of people with hemoglobin SS and 10 percent of people with hemoglobin SC may suffer a clinical stroke by age 45.\\n                \\nIn children, clinical stroke occurs most commonly between the ages of 2 and 9, but recent prevention strategies have lowered the risk. (See Transcranial Doppler (TCD) Ultrasound Screening) and Red Blood Cell Transfusions.)\\n                \\nWhen people with SCD show symptoms of stroke, their families or friends should call 9-1-1 right away. (See clinical stroke management.)\\n                \\nSilent Stroke and Thinking Problems\\n                \\nBrain imaging and tests of thinking (cognitive studies) have shown that children and adults with hemoglobin SS and hemoglobin S0 thalassemia often have signs of silent brain injury, also called silent stroke. Silent brain injury is damage to the brain without showing outward signs of stroke.\\n                \\nThis injury is common. Silent brain injury can lead to learning problems or trouble making decisions or holding down a job. (See Cognitive Screening and silent stroke management.)\\n                \\nEye Problems\\n                \\nSickle cell disease can injure blood vessels in the eye.\\n                \\nThe most common site of damage is the retina, where blood vessels can overgrow, get blocked, or bleed. The retina is the light-sensitive layer of tissue that lines the inside of the eye and sends visual messages through the optic nerve to the brain.\\n                \\nDetachment of the retina can occur. When the retina detaches, it is lifted or pulled from its normal position. These problems can cause visual impairment or loss. (See Eye Examinations.)\\n                \\nHeart Disease\\n                \\nPeople with SCD can have problems with blood vessels in the heart and with heart function. The heart can become enlarged. People can also develop pulmonary hypertension.\\n                \\nPeople with SCD who have received frequent blood transfusions may also have heart damage from iron overload. (See transfusion management.)\\n                \\nPulmonary Hypertension\\n                \\nIn adolescents and adults, injury to blood vessels in the lungs can make it hard for the heart to pump blood through them. This causes the pressure in lung blood vessels to rise. High pressure in these blood vessels is called pulmonary hypertension. Symptoms may include shortness of breath and fatigue.\\n                \\nWhen this condition is severe, it has been associated with a higher risk of death. (See screening for pulmonary hypertension.)\\n                \\nKidney Problems\\n                \\nThe kidneys are sensitive to the effects of red blood cell sickling.\\n                \\nSCD causes the kidneys to have trouble making the urine as concentrated as it should be. This may lead to a need to urinate often and to have bedwetting or uncontrolled urination during the night (nocturnal enuresis). This often starts in childhood. Other problems may include:\\n                \\nBlood in the urine\\n                \\nDecreased kidney function\\n                \\nKidney disease\\n                \\nProtein loss in the urine\\n                \\nPriapism\\n                \\nMales with SCD can have unwanted, sometimes prolonged, painful erections. This condition is called priapism.\\n                \\nPriapism happens when blood flow out of the erect penis is blocked by sickled cells. If it goes on for a long period of time, priapism can cause permanent damage to the penis and lead to impotence.\\n                \\nIf priapism lasts for more than 4 hours, emergency medical care should be sought to avoid complications. (See priapism management.)\\n                \\nGallstones\\n                \\nWhen red cells hemolyze, they release hemoglobin. Hemoglobin gets broken down into a substance called bilirubin. Bilirubin can form stones that get stuck in the gallbladder. The gallbladder is a small, sac-shaped organ beneath the liver that helps with digestion. Gallstones are a common problem in SCD.\\n                \\nGallstones may be formed early on but may not produce symptoms for years. When symptoms develop, they may include:\\n                \\nRight-sided upper belly pain\\n                \\nNausea\\n                \\nVomiting\\n                \\nIf problems continue or recur, a person may need surgery to remove the gallbladder.\\n                \\nLiver Complications\\n                \\nThere are a number of ways in which the liver may be injured in SCD.\\n                \\nSickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis is an uncommon, but severe, form of liver damage that occurs when sickled red cells block blood vessels in the liver. This blockage prevents enough oxygen from reaching liver tissue.\\n                \\nThese episodes are usually sudden and may recur. Children often recover, but some adults may have chronic problems that lead to liver failure.\\n                \\nPeople with SCD who have received frequent blood transfusions may develop liver damage from iron overload.\\n                \\nLeg Ulcers\\n                \\nSickle cell ulcers are sores that usually start small and then get larger and larger.\\n                \\nThe number of ulcers can vary from one to many. Some ulcers will heal quickly, but others may not heal and may last for long periods of time. Some ulcers come back after healing.\\n                \\nPeople with SCD usually dont get ulcers until after the age of 10.\\n                \\nJoint Complications\\n                \\nSickling in the bones of the hip and, less commonly, the shoulder joints, knees, and ankles, can decrease oxygen flow and result in severe damage. This damage is a condition called avascular or aseptic necrosis. This disease is usually found in adolescents and adults.\\n                \\nSymptoms include pain and problems with walking and joint movement. A person may need pain medicines, surgery, or joint replacement if symptoms persist.\\n                \\nDelayed Growth and Puberty\\n                \\nChildren with SCD may grow and develop more slowly than their peers because of anemia. They will reach full sexual maturity, but this may be delayed.\\n                \\nPregnancy\\n                \\nPregnancies in women with SCD can be risky for both the mother and the baby.\\n                \\nMothers may have medical complications including:\\n                \\nInfections\\n                \\nBlood clots\\n                \\nHigh blood pressure\\n                \\nIncreased pain episodes\\n                \\nThey are also at higher risk for:\\n                \\nMiscarriages\\n                \\nPremature births\\n                \\nSmall-for-dates babies or underweight babies\\n                \\n(See pregnancy management.)\\n                \\nMental Health\\n                \\nAs in other chronic diseases, people with SCD may feel sad and frustrated at times. The limitations that SCD can impose on a persons daily activities may cause them to feel isolated from others. Sometimes they become depressed.\\n                \\nPeople with SCD may also have trouble coping with pain and fatigue, as well as with frequent medical visits and hospitalizations.
