Experts often classify porphyrias as acute or cutaneous based on the symptoms a person experiences:\\n                \\n- Acute porphyrias affect the nervous system.

For example, porphyria cutanea tarda is most common in the United States, and variegate porphyria is most common in South America.1', 'Most porphyrias are inherited disorders. Scientists have identified genes for all eight enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway. Most porphyrias result from inheriting an abnormal gene, also called a gene mutation, from one parent. Some porphyrias, such as congenital erythropoietic porphyria, hepatoerythropoietic porphyria, and erythropoietic protoporphyria, occur when a person inherits two abnormal genes, one from each parent. The likeliness of a person passing the abnormal gene or genes to the next generation depends on the type of porphyria.\\n                \\nPorphyria cutanea tarda is usually an acquired disorder, meaning factors other than genes cause the enzyme deficiency.
