However, many caregivers find it hard to ask for help. They may feel they should be able to do everything themselves, or that it's not all right to leave the person in their care with someone else. Or maybe they cant afford to pay someone to watch the person for an hour or two. Family members, friends, and community resources can help caregivers of people with Alzheimers disease. Here are some tips about asking for help. - It's okay to ask for help from family, friends, and others. You don't have to do everything yourself.  - Ask people to help out in specific ways, like making a meal, visiting the person, or taking the person out for a short time.   - Call for help from home health care or adult day care services when needed.   - Use national and local resources to find out how to pay for some of this help.

The eyes need tears for overall eye health and clear vision. Dry eye can last a short time or it can be an ongoing condition. It can include a variety of symptoms, such as discomfort and pain. Your eyes may sting and burn and you may have redness and a sandy or gritty feeling, as if something is in your eye. You may have blurry vision and your eyes may feel tired. Having dry eyes can make it harder to do some activities, such as using a computer or reading for a long period of time, and it can make it hard to be in dry places, such as on an airplane.  Tears and Eye Health Tears are necessary for overall eye health and clear vision. The eye constantly makes tears to bathe, nourish, and protect the cornea. The cornea is the clear, dome-shaped outer surface that covers the eye in front of the iris, which is the colored part of the eye. The eye also makes tears in response to emergencies, such as a particle of dust in the eye, an infection or irritation of the eye, or an onset of strong emotions. Tears keep the eye moist, and wash away dust and debris. They also help protect the eye from infections. Tears are made of proteins (including growth factors), body salts, and vitamins that maintain the health of the eye surface and prevent infection.  Tear Components Tears have three major components. - an outer, oily, fat layer produced by the meibomian glands (located in the eyelids)  - a middle, watery, layer produced by the lacrimal glands (located just above the upper, outer corner of the eye)  - an inner, mucous layer produced by goblet cells (located within a thin clear layer which covers the white part of the eye and the inner surface of the eyelids called the conjunctiva). an outer, oily, fat layer produced by the meibomian glands (located in the eyelids) a middle, watery, layer produced by the lacrimal glands (located just above the upper, outer corner of the eye) an inner, mucous layer produced by goblet cells (located within a thin clear layer which covers the white part of the eye and the inner surface of the eyelids called the conjunctiva). When the lacrimal glands do not make enough tears, dry eye can result. Any disease process that changes the components of tears can make them unhealthy and result in dry eye. Type of Dry Eye There are two types of dry eye: aqueous tear-deficient dry eye and evaporative dry eye. Aqueous tear-deficient dry eye is a disorder in which the tear glands do not produce enough of the watery component of tears to maintain a healthy cornea. Evaporative dry eye may result from inflammation of the meibomian glands, located in the eyelids. These glands make the oily part of tears that slows evaporation and keeps the tears stable. Most people with dry eye will not have serious problems, but severe dry eye may lead to inflammation, ulcers, or scars on the cornea, and some loss of vision. Permanent loss of vision from dry eye is uncommon.', \"Many factors can lead to dry eye, including aging, medications, problems with eyelid function, disease, some types of surgery, environmental factors, and allergies. Many Older People Have Dry Eye Elderly people often have dryness of the eyes, but dry eye can occur at any age. Nearly five million Americans 50 years of age and older are estimated to have dry eye. Of these, more than three million are women and more than one and a half million are men. Tens of millions more have less severe symptoms. Dry eye is more common after menopause. Women who experience menopause prematurely are more likely to have eye surface damage from dry eye.  Medications Dry eye can be a side effect of some medications, including antihistamines, nasal decongestants, tranquilizers, certain blood pressure medicines, Parkinson's medications, and some anti-depressants. Women who are on hormone replacement therapy may experience dry eye symptoms. Eyelid Function Eyelid function can also be a factor in dry eye. Diseases that affect the eyelid, such as meibomian gland dysfunction, can also cause dry eye. Dry eye may also occur from exposure keratitis, in which the eyelids do not close properly during normal blinking or sleep. Skin diseases on or around the eyelids can result in dry eye. Infrequent blinking associated with staring at computer or video screens also may lead to dry eye symptoms. Systemic Diseases Certain diseases can cause dry eye. Chronic inflammation of the conjunctiva, or the lacrimal glands, can cause dry eye. Immune system disorders such as Sjgren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis also can cause dry eye. Sjgren's syndrome leads to inflammation and dryness of the mouth, eyes, and other mucous membranes. Thyroid disease, which can sometimes cause the eye to bulge out, can also lead to dry eye by increasing the surface area of the eye exposed to the environment. Surgeries Some types of surgery can lead to dry eye. For example, dry eye can develop after the refractive surgery known as LASIK. These symptoms generally last three to six months, but may last longer in some cases. Dry eye can also occur as a result of cosmetic surgery that widens the eyelids too much and increases the surface area of the eye exposed to the environment. Environment Environmental exposure to irritants such as chemical fumes and tobacco smoke, or drafts from air conditioning or heating can cause dry eye. Wearing contact lenses over a long period of time can lead to a loss of feeling in the cornea and this can cause dry eye. Allergies also can be associated with dry eye.\", 'Symptoms of Dry Eye Dry eye symptoms may include any of the following. - stinging or burning of the eye   - a sandy or gritty feeling as if something is in the eye   - episodes of excess tears following very dry eye periods   - a stringy discharge from the eye   - pain and redness of the eye   - episodes of blurred vision  - heavy eyelids   - inability to cry when emotionally stressed   - uncomfortable contact lenses   - decreased ability to read, work on the computer, or do any activity that requires you to use your eyes for long periods of time   - eye fatigue.  stinging or burning of the eye a sandy or gritty feeling as if something is in the eye episodes of excess tears following very dry eye periods a stringy discharge from the eye pain and redness of the eye episodes of blurred vision heavy eyelids inability to cry when emotionally stressed uncomfortable contact lenses decreased ability to read, work on the computer, or do any activity that requires you to use your eyes for long periods of time eye fatigue. If you have symptoms that you think could result from dry eye, consult an eye care professional to get an accurate diagnosis of the condition and begin treatment.  Diagnosing Dry Eye Diagnosis of dry eye requires a comprehensive eye evaluation. Your eye care professional will ask you about your symptoms, your health (conditions for which you are treated, medications that you take), your eye history (use of contact lenses, past refractive or other eye surgery), and aspects of your daily environment (exposure to environmental allergens or occupational hazards). He or she will test your vision, check your eye pressure, examine your eyelids and front eye structures, and, if necessary, may dilate the pupils to examine the inside of the eye. Your eye care professional may order a tearing test to find out if you are making enough tears to keep your eyes moist. In one type of test, called a Schirmers test, the doctor may measure your tear production by placing strips of blotting paper under your lower eyelids, usually done after numbing the eye with anesthetic drops. After a few minutes, the doctor removes the strips and measures the amount of tear production.']}"}, "time": 1746283467.9959629}
