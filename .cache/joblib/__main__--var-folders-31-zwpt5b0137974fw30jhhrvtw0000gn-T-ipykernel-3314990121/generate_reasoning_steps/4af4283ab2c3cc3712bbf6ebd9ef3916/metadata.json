Swallowing may be especially difficult for those with too little saliva. For example, people with dry mouth may be unable to swallow dry food at all unless they also drink fluids with food. They also need to take small bites of food and be very aware of chewing and swallowing so they don't choke. Dry mouth may also increase the chance of developing dental decay as well as oral fungal infections such as thrush, which causes painful white patches in the mouth.\", 'Dry mouth can be uncomfortable. Some people notice a sticky, dry feeling in the mouth. Others notice a burning feeling or difficulty while eating. The throat may feel dry, too, and swallowing without extra fluids can often be difficult. Also, people with dry mouth may develop mouth sores, cracked lips, and a dry, rough tongue.', \"Yes. More than 400 medicines, including some over-the-counter medications, can cause the salivary glands to make less saliva, or to change the composition of the saliva so that it can't perform the functions it should. As an example, medicines for urinary incontinence, allergies, high blood pressure, and depression often cause dry mouth.\", 'Certain cancer treatments can affect the salivary glands. Head and neck radiation therapy can cause the glands to produce little or no saliva. Chemotherapy may cause the salivary glands to produce thicker saliva, which makes the mouth feel dry and sticky.']}"}, "time": 1746283468.8739462}
