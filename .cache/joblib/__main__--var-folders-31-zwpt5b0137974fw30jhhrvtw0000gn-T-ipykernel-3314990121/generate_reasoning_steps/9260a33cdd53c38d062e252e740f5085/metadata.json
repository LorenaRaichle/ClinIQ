Your primary care doctor may evaluate your symptoms first. He or she will then decide whether you need to see a sleep specialist.\\n                \\nSleep specialists are doctors who diagnose and treat people who have sleep problems. Examples of such doctors include lung and nerve specialists and ear, nose, and throat specialists. Other types of doctors also can be sleep specialists.\\n                \\nMedical and Family Histories\\n                \\nIf you think you have a sleep problem, consider keeping a sleep diary for 1 to 2 weeks. Bring the diary with you to your next medical appointment.\\n                \\nWrite down when you go to sleep, wake up, and take naps. Also write down how much you sleep each night, how alert and rested you feel in the morning, and how sleepy you feel at various times during the day. This information can help your doctor figure out whether you have a sleep disorder.\\n                \\nYou can find a sample sleep diary in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\'s \"Your Guide to Healthy Sleep.\"\\n                \\nAt your appointment, your doctor will ask you questions about how you sleep and how you function during the day.\\n                \\nYour doctor also will want to know how loudly and often you snore or make gasping or choking sounds during sleep. Often you\\'re not aware of such symptoms and must ask a family member or bed partner to report them.\\n                \\nLet your doctor know if anyone in your family has been diagnosed with sleep apnea or has had symptoms of the disorder.\\n                \\nMany people aren\\'t aware of their symptoms and aren\\'t diagnosed.\\n                \\nIf you\\'re a parent of a child who may have sleep apnea, tell your child\\'s doctor about your child\\'s signs and symptoms.\\n                \\nPhysical Exam\\n                \\nYour doctor will check your mouth, nose, and throat for extra or large tissues. Children who have sleep apnea might have enlarged tonsils. Doctors may need only a physical exam and medical history to diagnose sleep apnea in children.\\n                \\nAdults who have sleep apnea may have an enlarged uvula (U-vu-luh) or soft palate. The uvula is the tissue that hangs from the middle of the back of your mouth. The soft palate is the roof of your mouth in the back of your throat.\\n                \\nSleep Studies\\n                \\nSleep studies are tests that measure how well you sleep and how your body responds to sleep problems. These tests can help your doctor find out whether you have a sleep disorder and how severe it is. Sleep studies are the most accurate tests for diagnosing sleep apnea.\\n                \\nThere are different kinds of sleep studies. If your doctor thinks you have sleep apnea, he or she may recommend a polysomnogram (poly-SOM-no-gram; also called a PSG) or a home-based portable monitor.\\n                \\nPolysomnogram\\n                \\nA PSG is the most common sleep study for diagnosing sleep apnea. This study records brain activity, eye movements, heart rate, and blood pressure.\\n                \\nA PSG also records the amount of oxygen in your blood, air movement through your nose while you breathe, snoring, and chest movements. The chest movements show whether you\\'re making an effort to breathe.\\n                \\nPSGs often are done at sleep centers or sleep labs. The test is painless. You\\'ll go to sleep as usual, except you\\'ll have sensors attached to your scalp, face, chest, limbs, and a finger. The staff at the sleep center will use the sensors to check on you throughout the night.\\n                \\nA sleep specialist will review the results of your PSG to see whether you have sleep apnea and how severe it is. He or she will use the results to plan your treatment.\\n                \\nYour doctor also may use a PSG to find the best setting for you on a CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machine. CPAP is the most common treatment for sleep apnea. A CPAP machine uses mild air pressure to keep your airway open while you sleep.\\n                \\nIf your doctor thinks that you have sleep apnea, he or she may schedule a split-night sleep study. During the first half of the night, your sleep will be checked without a CPAP machine. This will show whether you have sleep apnea and how severe it is.\\n                \\nIf the PSG shows that you have sleep apnea, youll use a CPAP machine during the second half of the split-night study. The staff at the sleep center will adjust the flow of air from the CPAP machine to find the setting that works best for you.\\n                \\nHome-Based Portable Monitor\\n                \\nYour doctor may recommend a home-based sleep test with a portable monitor. The portable monitor will record some of the same information as a PSG. For example, it may record:\\n                \\nThe amount of oxygen in your blood\\n                \\nAir movement through your nose while you breathe\\n                \\nYour heart rate\\n                \\nChest movements that show whether you\\'re making an effort to breathe\\n                \\nA sleep specialist may use the results from a home-based sleep test to help diagnose sleep apnea. He or she also may use the results to decide whether you need a full PSG study in a sleep center.', \"Sleep apnea is treated with lifestyle changes, mouthpieces, breathing devices, and surgery. Medicines typically aren't used to treat the condition.\\n                \\nThe goals of treating sleep apnea are to:\\n                \\nRestore regular breathing during sleep\\n                \\nRelieve symptoms such as loud snoring and daytime sleepiness\\n                \\nTreatment may improve other medical problems linked to sleep apnea, such as high blood pressure. Treatment also can reduce your risk for heart disease,stroke, and diabetes.\\n                \\nIf you have sleep apnea, talk with your doctor or sleep specialist about the treatment options that will work best for you.\\n                \\nLifestyle changes and/or mouthpieces may relieve mild sleep apnea. People who have moderate or severe sleep apnea may need breathing devices or surgery.\\n                \\nIf you continue to have daytime sleepiness despite treatment, your doctor may ask whether you're getting enough sleep. (Adults should get at least 7 to 8 hours of sleep; children and teens need more. For more information, go to the Health Topics Sleep Deprivation and Deficiency article.)\\n                \\nIf treatment and enough sleep don't relieve your daytime sleepiness, your doctor will consider other treatment options.\\n                \\nLifestyle Changes\\n                \\nIf you have mild sleep apnea, some changes in daily activities or habits might be all the treatment you need.\\n                \\nAvoid alcohol and medicines that make you sleepy. They make it harder for your throat to stay open while you sleep.\\n                \\nLose weight if you're overweight or obese. Even a little weight loss can improve your symptoms.\\n                \\nSleep on your side instead of your back to help keep your throat open. You can sleep with special pillows or shirts that prevent you from sleeping on your back.\\n                \\nKeep your nasal passages open at night with nasal sprays or allergy medicines, if needed. Talk with your doctor about whether these treatments might help you.\\n                \\nIf you smoke, quit. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking.\\n                \\nMouthpieces\\n                \\nA mouthpiece, sometimes called an oral appliance, may help some people who have mild sleep apnea. Your doctor also may recommend a mouthpiece if you snore loudly but don't have sleep apnea.\\n                \\nA dentist or orthodontist can make a custom-fit plastic mouthpiece for treating sleep apnea. (An orthodontist specializes in correcting teeth or jaw problems.) The mouthpiece will adjust your lower jaw and your tongue to help keep your airways open while you sleep.\\n                \\nIf you use a mouthpiece, tell your doctor if you have discomfort or pain while using the device. You may need periodic office visits so your doctor can adjust your mouthpiece to fit better.\\n                \\nBreathing Devices\\n                \\nCPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) is the most common treatment for moderate to severe sleep apnea in adults. A CPAP machine uses a mask that fits over your mouth and nose, or just over your nose.\\n                \\nThe machine gently blows air into your throat. The pressure from the air helps keep your airway open while you sleep.\\n                \\nTreating sleep apnea may help you stop snoring. But not snoring doesn't mean that you no longer have sleep apnea or can stop using CPAP. Your sleep apnea will return if you stop using your CPAP machine or dont use it correctly.\\n                \\nUsually, a technician will come to your home to bring the CPAP equipment. The technician will set up the CPAP machine and adjust it based on your doctor's prescription. After the initial setup, you may need to have the CPAP adjusted from time to time for the best results.\\n                \\nCPAP treatment may cause side effects in some people. These side effects include a dry or stuffy nose, irritated skin on your face, dry mouth, and headaches. If your CPAP isn't adjusted properly, you may get stomach bloating and discomfort while wearing the mask.\\n                \\nIf you're having trouble with CPAP side effects, work with your sleep specialist, his or her nursing staff, and the CPAP technician. Together, you can take steps to reduce the side effects.\\n                \\nFor example, the CPAP settings or size/fit of the mask might need to be adjusted. Adding moisture to the air as it flows through the mask or using nasal spray can help relieve a dry, stuffy, or runny nose.\\n                \\nThere are many types of CPAP machines and masks. Tell your doctor if you're not happy with the type you're using. He or she may suggest switching to a different type that might work better for you.\\n                \\nPeople who have severe sleep apnea symptoms generally feel much better once they begin treatment with CPAP.\\n                \\nSurgery\\n                \\nSome people who have sleep apnea might benefit from surgery. The type of surgery and how well it works depend on the cause of the sleep apnea.\\n                \\nSurgery is done to widen breathing passages. It usually involves shrinking, stiffening, or removing excess tissue in the mouth and throat or resetting the lower jaw.\\n                \\nSurgery to shrink or stiffen excess tissue is done in a doctor's office or a hospital. Shrinking tissue may involve small shots or other treatments to the tissue. You may need a series of treatments to shrink the excess tissue. To stiffen excess tissue, the doctor makes a small cut in the tissue and inserts a piece of stiff plastic.\\n                \\nSurgery to remove excess tissue is done in a hospital. You're given medicine to help you sleep during the surgery. After surgery, you may have throat pain that lasts for 1 to 2 weeks.\\n                \\nSurgery to remove the tonsils, if they're blocking the airway, might be helpful for some children. Your child's doctor may suggest waiting some time to see whether these tissues shrink on their own. This is common as small children grow.\", \"Thrombocytopenia (THROM-bo-si-to-PE-ne-ah) is a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal number of blood cell fragments called platelets (PLATE-lets).\\n                \\nPlatelets are made in your bone marrow along with other kinds of blood cells. They travel through your blood vessels and stick together (clot) to stop any bleeding that may happen if a blood vessel is damaged. Platelets also are called thrombocytes (THROM-bo-sites) because a clot also is called a thrombus.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nWhen your blood has too few platelets, mild to serious bleeding can occur. Bleeding can occur inside your body (internal bleeding) or underneath your skin or from the surface of your skin (external bleeding).\\n                \\nA normal platelet count in adults ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood. A platelet count of less than 150,000 platelets per microliter is lower than normal. If your blood platelet count falls below normal, you have thrombocytopenia.\\n                \\nHowever, the risk for serious bleeding doesn't occur until the count becomes very lowless than 10,000 or 20,000 platelets per microliter. Mild bleeding sometimes occurs when the count is less than 50,000 platelets per microliter.\\n                \\nMany factors can cause a low platelet count, such as:\\n                \\nThe body's bone marrow doesn't make enough platelets.\\n                \\nThe bone marrow makes enough platelets, but the body destroys them or uses them up.\\n                \\nThe spleen holds on to too many platelets. The spleen is an organ that normally stores about one-third of the body's platelets. It also helps your body fight infection and remove unwanted cell material.\\n                \\nA combination of the above factors.\\n                \\nHow long thrombocytopenia lasts depends on its cause. It can last from days to years.\\n                \\nThe treatment for this condition also depends on its cause and severity. Mild thrombocytopenia often doesn't require treatment. If the condition causes or puts you at risk for serious bleeding, you may need medicines or blood or platelet transfusions. Rarely, the spleen may need to be removed.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nThrombocytopenia can be fatal, especially if the bleeding is severe or occurs in the brain. However, the overall outlook for people who have the condition is good, especially if the cause of the low platelet count is found and treated.\", 'Many factors can cause thrombocytopenia (a low platelet count). The condition can be inherited or acquired. \"Inherited\" means your parents pass the gene for the condition to you. \"Acquired\" means you aren\\'t born with the condition, but you develop it. Sometimes the cause of thrombocytopenia isn\\'t known.\\n                \\nIn general, a low platelet count occurs because:\\n                \\nThe body\\'s bone marrow doesn\\'t make enough platelets.\\n                \\nThe bone marrow makes enough platelets, but the body destroys them or uses them up.\\n                \\nThe spleen holds on to too many platelets.\\n                \\nA combination of the above factors also may cause a low platelet count.\\n                \\nThe Bone Marrow Doesn\\'t Make Enough Platelets\\n                \\nBone marrow is the sponge-like tissue inside the bones. It contains stem cells that develop into red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. When stem cells are damaged, they don\\'t grow into healthy blood cells.\\n                \\nMany conditions and factors can damage stem cells.\\n                \\nCancer\\n                \\nCancer, such as leukemia (lu-KE-me-ah) or lymphoma (lim-FO-ma), can damage the bone marrow and destroy blood stem cells. Cancer treatments, such as radiation and chemotherapy, also destroy the stem cells.\\n                \\nAplastic Anemia\\n                \\nAplastic anemia is a rare, serious blood disorder in which the bone marrow stops making enough new blood cells. This lowers the number of platelets in your blood.\\n                \\nToxic Chemicals\\n                \\nExposure to toxic chemicalssuch as pesticides, arsenic, and benzenecan slow the production of platelets.\\n                \\nMedicines\\n                \\nSome medicines, such as diuretics and chloramphenicol, can slow the production of platelets. Chloramphenicol (an antibiotic) rarely is used in the United States.\\n                \\nCommon over-the-counter medicines, such as aspirin or ibuprofen, also can affect platelets.\\n                \\nAlcohol\\n                \\nAlcohol also slows the production of platelets. A temporary drop in the platelet count is common among heavy drinkers, especially if they\\'re eating foods that are low in iron, vitamin B12, or folate.\\n                \\nViruses\\n                \\nChickenpox, mumps, rubella, Epstein-Barr virus, or parvovirus can decrease your platelet count for a while. People who have AIDS often develop thrombocytopenia.\\n                \\nGenetic Conditions\\n                \\nSome genetic conditions can cause low numbers of platelets in the blood. Examples include Wiskott-Aldrich and May-Hegglin syndromes.\\n                \\nThe Body Destroys Its Own Platelets\\n                \\nA low platelet count can occur even if the bone marrow makes enough platelets. The body may destroy its own platelets due to autoimmune diseases, certain medicines, infections, surgery, pregnancy, and some conditions that cause too much blood clotting.\\n                \\nAutoimmune Diseases\\n                \\nAutoimmune diseases occur if the body\\'s immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells in the body. If an autoimmune disease destroys the body\\'s platelets, thrombocytopenia can occur.\\n                \\nOne example of this type of autoimmune disease is immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). ITP is a bleeding disorder in which the blood doesn\\'t clot as it should. An autoimmune response is thought to cause most cases of ITP.\\n                \\nNormally, your immune system helps your body fight off infections and diseases. But if you have ITP, your immune system attacks and destroys its own platelets. Why this happens isn\\'t known. (ITP also may occur if the immune system attacks your bone marrow, which makes platelets.)\\n                \\nOther autoimmune diseases that destroy platelets include lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.\\n                \\nMedicines\\n                \\nA reaction to medicine can confuse your body and cause it to destroy its platelets. Examples of medicines that may cause this to happen include quinine; antibiotics that contain sulfa; and some medicines for seizures, such as Dilantin, vancomycin, and rifampin. (Quinine is a substance often found in tonic water and nutritional health products.)\\n                \\nHeparin is a medicine commonly used to prevent blood clots. But an immune reaction may trigger the medicine to cause blood clots and thrombocytopenia. This condition is called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT rarely occurs outside of a hospital.\\n                \\nIn HIT, the body\\'s immune system attacks a substance formed by heparin and a protein on the surface of the platelets. This attack activates the platelets and they start to form blood clots.\\n                \\nBlood clots can form deep in the legs (deep vein thrombosis), or they can break loose and travel to the lungs (pulmonary embolism).\\n                \\nInfection\\n                \\nA low platelet count can occur after blood poisoning from a widespread bacterial infection. A virus, such as mononucleosis or cytomegalovirus, also can cause a low platelet count.\\n                \\nSurgery\\n                \\nPlatelets can be destroyed when they pass through man-made heart valves, blood vessel grafts, or machines and tubing used for blood transfusions or bypass surgery.\\n                \\nPregnancy\\n                \\nAbout 5 percent of pregnant women develop mild thrombocytopenia when they\\'re close to delivery. The exact cause isn\\'t known for sure.\\n                \\nRare and Serious Conditions That Cause Blood Clots\\n                \\nSome rare and serious conditions can cause a low platelet count. Two examples are thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).\\n                \\nTTP is a rare blood condition. It causes blood clots to form in the body\\'s small blood vessels, including vessels in the brains, kidneys, and heart.\\n                \\nDIC is a rare complication of pregnancy, severe infections, or severe trauma. Tiny blood clots form suddenly throughout the body.\\n                \\nIn both conditions, the blood clots use up many of the blood\\'s platelets.\\n                \\nThe Spleen Holds On to Too Many Platelets\\n                \\nUsually, one-third of the body\\'s platelets are held in the spleen. If the spleen is enlarged, it will hold on to too many platelets. This means that not enough platelets will circulate in the blood.\\n                \\nAn enlarged spleen often is due to cancer or severe liver disease, such as cirrhosis (sir-RO-sis). Cirrhosis is a disease in which the liver is scarred. This prevents it from working well.\\n                \\nAn enlarged spleen also might be due to a bone marrow condition, such as myelofibrosis (MI-eh-lo-fi-BRO-sis). With this condition, the bone marrow is scarred and isn\\'t able to make blood cells.']}"}, "time": 1746283466.321965}
