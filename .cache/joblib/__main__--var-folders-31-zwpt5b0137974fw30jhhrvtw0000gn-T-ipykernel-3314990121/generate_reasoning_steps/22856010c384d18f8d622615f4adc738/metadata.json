Mild cases require no treatment. People with severe anemia may need blood transfusions.  In newborns with dangerous levels of jaundice, a health care provider may recommend an exchange transfusion. Surgical removal of the spleen (splenectomy) may also be necessary to help reduce the destruction of red blood cells. However, this does not help in all cases. With small children, this is delayed as long as possible to allow the immune system to mature. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Someone who had a splenectomy should receive the pneumococcal vaccine at recommended intervals. They also should receive preventive antibiotics until age 5.

The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Medium-chain 3-ketoacyl-coa thiolase deficiency. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal recessive inheritance - Decreased liver function - Dehydration - Metabolic acidosis - Myoglobinuria - Neonatal death - Rhabdomyolysis - Vomiting - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Doyne honeycomb retinal dystrophy (DHRD) is a condition that affects the eyes and causes vision loss. It is characterized by small, round, white spots known as drusen that accumulate beneath the retinal pigment epithelium (the pigmented layer of the retina). Over time, drusen may grow and come together, creating a honeycomb pattern. It usually begins in early to mid adulthood, but the age of onset varies. The degree of vision loss also varies. DHRD is usually caused by mutations in the EFEMP1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Doyne honeycomb retinal dystrophy?
