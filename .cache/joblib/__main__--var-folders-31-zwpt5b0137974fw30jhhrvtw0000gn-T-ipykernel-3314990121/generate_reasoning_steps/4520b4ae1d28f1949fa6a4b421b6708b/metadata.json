Without enough vitamin B12, your body can't make enough healthy red blood cells, which causes anemia.\\n                \\nSome of the signs and symptoms of pernicious anemia apply to all types of anemia. Other signs and symptoms are specific to a lack of vitamin B12.\\n                \\nSigns and Symptoms of Anemia\\n                \\nThe most common symptom of all types of anemia is fatigue (tiredness). Fatigue occurs because your body doesnt have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen to its various parts.\\n                \\nA low red blood cell count also can cause shortness of breath, dizziness, headache, coldness in your hands and feet, pale or yellowish skin, and chest pain.\\n                \\nA lack of red blood cells also means that your heart has to work harder to move oxygen-rich blood through your body. This can lead to irregular heartbeats called arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs), heart murmur, an enlarged heart, or even heart failure.\\n                \\nSigns and Symptoms of Vitamin B12 Deficiency\\n                \\nVitamin B12 deficiency may lead to nerve damage. This can cause tingling and numbness in your hands and feet, muscle weakness, and loss of reflexes. You also may feel unsteady, lose your balance, and have trouble walking. Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause weakened bones and may lead to hip fractures.\\n                \\nSevere vitamin B12 deficiency can cause neurological problems, such as confusion, dementia, depression, and memory loss.\\n                \\nOther symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency involve the digestive tract. These symptoms include nausea (feeling sick to your stomach) and vomiting, heartburn, abdominal bloating and gas, constipation or diarrhea, loss of appetite, and weight loss. An enlarged liver is another symptom.\\n                \\nA smooth, thick, red tongue also is a sign of vitamin B12 deficiency and pernicious anemia.\\n                \\nInfants who have vitamin B12 deficiency may have poor reflexes or unusual movements, such as face tremors. They may have trouble feeding due to tongue and throat problems. They also may be irritable. If vitamin B12 deficiency isn't treated, these infants may have permanent growth problems.\", \"Your doctor will diagnose pernicious anemia based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and test results.\\n                \\nYour doctor will want to find out whether the condition is due to a lack of intrinsic factor or another cause. He or she also will want to find out the severity of the condition, so it can be properly treated.\\n                \\nSpecialists Involved\\n                \\nPrimary care doctorssuch as family doctors, internists, and pediatricians (doctors who treat children)often diagnose and treat pernicious anemia. Other kinds of doctors also may be involved, including:\\n                \\nA neurologist (nervous system specialist)\\n                \\nA cardiologist (heart specialist)\\n                \\nA hematologist (blood disease specialist)\\n                \\nA gastroenterologist (digestive tract specialist)\\n                \\nMedical and Family Histories\\n                \\nYour doctor may ask about your signs and symptoms. He or she also may ask:\\n                \\nWhether you've had any stomach or intestinal surgeries\\n                \\nWhether you have any digestive disorders, such as celiac disease or Crohn's disease\\n                \\nAbout your diet and any medicines you take\\n                \\nWhether you have a family history of anemia or pernicious anemia\\n                \\nWhether you have a family history of autoimmune disorders (such as Addison's disease, type 1 diabetes, Graves' disease, or vitiligo). Research suggests a link may exist between these autoimmune disorders and pernicious anemia that's caused by an autoimmune response.\\n                \\nPhysical Exam\\n                \\nDuring the physical exam, your doctor may check for pale or yellowish skin and an enlarged liver. He or she may listen to your heart for rapid or irregular heartbeats or a heart murmur.\\n                \\nYour doctor also may check for signs of nerve damage. He or she may want to see how well your muscles, eyes, senses, and reflexes work. Your doctor may ask questions or do tests to check your mental status, coordination, and ability to walk.\\n                \\nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\\n                \\nBlood tests and procedures can help diagnose pernicious anemia and find out what's causing it.\\n                \\nComplete Blood Count\\n                \\nOften, the first test used to diagnose many types of anemia is a complete blood count (CBC). This test measures many parts of your blood. For this test, a small amount of blood is drawn from a vein (usually in your arm) using a needle.\\n                \\nA CBC checks your hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin) and hematocrit (hee-MAT-oh-crit) levels. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that helps red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. Hematocrit is a measure of how much space red blood cells take up in your blood. A low level of hemoglobin or hematocrit is a sign of anemia.\\n                \\nThe normal range of these levels may be lower in certain racial and ethnic populations. Your doctor can explain your test results to you.\\n                \\nThe CBC also checks the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets (PLATE-lets) in your blood. Abnormal results may be a sign of anemia, another blood disorder, an infection, or another condition.\\n                \\nFinally, the CBC looks at mean corpuscular (kor-PUS-kyu-lar) volume (MCV). MCV is a measure of the average size of your red blood cells. MCV can be a clue as to what's causing your anemia. In pernicious anemia, the red blood cells tend to be larger than normal.\\n                \\nOther Blood Tests\\n                \\nIf the CBC results confirm that you have anemia, you may need other blood tests to find out what type of anemia you have.\\n                \\nA reticulocyte (re-TIK-u-lo-site) count measures the number of young red blood cells in your blood. The test shows whether your bone marrow is making red blood cells at the correct rate. People who have pernicious anemia have low reticulocyte counts.\\n                \\nSerum folate, iron, and iron-binding capacity tests also can help show whether you have pernicious anemia or another type of anemia.\\n                \\nAnother common test, called the Combined Binding Luminescence Test, sometimes gives false results. Scientists are working to develop a more reliable test.\\n                \\nYour doctor may recommend other blood tests to check:\\n                \\nYour vitamin B12 level. A low level of vitamin B12 in the blood indicates pernicious anemia. However, a falsely normal or high value of vitamin B12 in the blood may occur if antibodies interfere with the test.\\n                \\nYour homocysteine and methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels. High levels of these substances in your body are a sign of pernicious anemia.\\n                \\nFor intrinsic factor antibodies and parietal cell antibodies. These antibodies also are a sign of pernicious anemia.\\n                \\nBone Marrow Tests\\n                \\nBone marrow tests can show whether your bone marrow is healthy and making enough red blood cells. The two bone marrow tests are aspiration (as-pi-RA-shun) and biopsy.\\n                \\nFor aspiration, your doctor removes a small amount of fluid bone marrow through a needle. For a biopsy, your doctor removes a small amount of bone marrow tissue through a larger needle. The samples are then examined under a microscope.\\n                \\nIn pernicious anemia, the bone marrow cells that turn into blood cells are larger than normal.\", 'Doctors treat pernicious anemia by replacing the missing vitamin B12 in the body. People who have pernicious anemia may need lifelong treatment.\\n                \\nThe goals of treating pernicious anemia include:\\n                \\nPreventing or treating the anemia and its signs and symptoms\\n                \\nPreventing or managing complications, such as heart and nerve damage\\n                \\nTreating the cause of the pernicious anemia (if a cause can be found)\\n                \\nSpecific Types of Treatment\\n                \\nPernicious anemia usually is easy to treat with vitamin B12 shots or pills.\\n                \\nIf you have severe pernicious anemia, your doctor may recommend shots first. Shots usually are given in a muscle every day or every week until the level of vitamin B12 in your blood increases. After your vitamin B12 blood level returns to normal, you may get a shot only once a month.\\n                \\nFor less severe pernicious anemia, your doctor may recommend large doses of vitamin B12 pills. A vitamin B12 nose gel and spray also are available. These products may be useful for people who have trouble swallowing pills, such as older people who have had strokes.\\n                \\nYour signs and symptoms may begin to improve within a few days after you start treatment. Your doctor may advise you to limit your physical activity until your condition improves.\\n                \\nIf your pernicious anemia is caused by something other than a lack of intrinsic factor, you may get treatment for the cause (if a cause can be found). For example, your doctor may prescribe medicines to treat a condition that prevents your body from absorbing vitamin B12.\\n                \\nIf medicines are the cause of your pernicious anemia, your doctor may change the type or dose of medicine you take. Infants of strict vegetarian mothers may be given vitamin B12 supplements from birth.', \"You can't prevent pernicious anemia caused by a lack of intrinsic factor. Without intrinsic factor, you won't be able to absorb vitamin B12 and will develop pernicious anemia.\\n                \\nAlthough uncommon, some people develop pernicious anemia because they don't get enough vitamin B12 in their diets. You can take steps to prevent pernicious anemia caused by dietary factors.\\n                \\nEating foods high in vitamin B12 can help prevent low vitamin B12 levels. Good food sources of vitamin B12 include:\\n                \\nBreakfast cereals with added vitamin B12\\n                \\nMeats such as beef, liver, poultry, and fish\\n                \\nEggs and dairy products (such as milk, yogurt, and cheese)\\n                \\nFoods fortified with vitamin B12, such as soy-based beverages and vegetarian burgers\\n                \\nIf youre a strict vegetarian, talk with your doctor about having your vitamin B12 level checked regularly.\\n                \\nVitamin B12 also is found in multivitamins and B-complex vitamin supplements. Doctors may recommend supplements for people at risk for vitamin B12 deficiency, such as strict vegetarians or people who have had stomach surgery.\\n                \\nOlder adults may have trouble absorbing vitamin B12. Thus, doctors may recommend that older adults eat foods fortified with vitamin B12 or take vitamin B12 supplements.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283465.588414}
