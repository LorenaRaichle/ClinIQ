Your risk for CHD increases with the number of CHD risk factors you have.\\n                \\nOne step you can take is to adopt a heart healthy lifestyle. A heart healthy lifestyle should be part of a lifelong approach to healthy living.\\n                \\nFor example, if you smoke, try to quit. Smoking can raise your risk for CHD andheart attackand worsen other CHD risk factors. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.\\n                \\nFor more information about quitting smoking, go to the Health Topics Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\'s (NHLBI\\'s) \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.\"\\n                \\nFollowing a healthy diet also is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. A healthy diet includes a variety of vegetables and fruits. It also includes whole grains, fat-free or low-fat dairy products, and protein foods, such as lean meats, poultry without skin, seafood, processed soy products, nuts, seeds, beans, and peas.\\n                \\nA healthy diet is low in sodium (salt), added sugars, solid fats, and refined grains. Solid fats are saturated fat and trans fatty acids. Refined grains come from processing whole grains, which results in a loss of nutrients (such as dietary fiber).\\n                \\nThe NHLBI\\'s Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) are two programs that promote healthy eating.\\n                \\nIf you\\'reoverweight or obese, work with your doctor to create a reasonable weight-loss plan.

Talk with your doctor about what types of activity are safe for you.\\n                \\nFor more information about physical activity, go to the Health Topics Physical Activity and Your Heart article and the NHLBI\\'s \"Your Guide to Physical Activity and Your Heart.\"\\n                \\nKnow your family history of CHD. If you or someone in your family has CHD, be sure to tell your doctor.\\n                \\nIf lifestyle changes aren\\'t enough, you also may need medicines to control your CHD risk factors. Take all of your medicines as prescribed.\\n                \\nFor more information about lifestyle changes and medicines, go to \"How Is Heart Disease Treated?\"', 'To understand high blood cholesterol (ko-LES-ter-ol), it helps to learn about cholesterol. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance thats found in all cells of the body.\\n                \\nYour body needs some cholesterol to make hormones, vitamin D, and substances that help you digest foods. Your body makes all the cholesterol it needs. However, cholesterol also is found in some of the foods you eat.\\n                \\nCholesterol travels through your bloodstream in small packages called lipoproteins (lip-o-PRO-teens). These packages are made of fat (lipid) on the inside and proteins on the outside.\\n                \\nTwo kinds of lipoproteins carry cholesterol throughout your body: low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL). Having healthy levels of both types of lipoproteins is important.\\n                \\nLDL cholesterol sometimes is called bad cholesterol. A high LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in your arteries. (Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to your body.)\\n                \\nHDL cholesterol sometimes is called good cholesterol. This is because it carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Your liver removes the cholesterol from your body.\\n                \\nWhat Is High Blood Cholesterol?\\n                \\nHigh blood cholesterol is a condition in which you have too much cholesterol in your blood. By itself, the condition usually has no signs or symptoms. Thus, many people dont know that their cholesterol levels are too high.\\n                \\nPeople who have high blood cholesterol have a greater chance of getting coronary heart disease, also called coronary artery disease. (In this article, the term heart disease refers to coronary heart disease.)\\n                \\nThe higher the level of LDL cholesterol in your blood, the GREATER your chance is of getting heart disease. The higher the level of HDL cholesterol in your blood, the LOWER your chance is of getting heart disease.\\n                \\nCoronary heart disease is a condition in which plaque (plak) builds up inside the coronary (heart) arteries. Plaque is made up of cholesterol, fat, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. When plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis (ATH-er-o-skler-O-sis).\\n                \\nAtherosclerosis\\n                \\n\\n                \\nOver time, plaque hardens and narrows your coronary arteries. This limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart.\\n                \\nEventually, an area of plaque can rupture (break open). This causes a blood clot to form on the surface of the plaque. If the clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block blood flow through a coronary artery.\\n                \\nIf the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle is reduced or blocked, angina (an-JI-nuh or AN-juh-nuh) or a heart attack may occur.\\n                \\nAngina is chest pain or discomfort. It may feel like pressure or squeezing in your chest. The pain also may occur in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. Angina pain may even feel like indigestion.\\n                \\nA heart attack occurs if the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle is cut off. If blood flow isnt restored quickly, the section of heart muscle begins to die. Without quick treatment, a heart attack can lead to serious problems or death.\\n                \\nPlaque also can build up in other arteries in your body, such as the arteries that bring oxygen-rich blood to your brain and limbs. This can lead to problems such as carotid artery disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nLowering your cholesterol may slow, reduce, or even stop the buildup of plaque in your arteries. It also may reduce the risk of plaque rupturing and causing dangerous blood clots.\\n                \\n\\n                \\nSources: National Center for Health Statistics (20072010).

Third report of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) exert panel on detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood cholesterol in adults (Adult Treatment Panel III) final report.', 'Many factors can affect the cholesterol levels in your blood. You can control some factors, but not others.\\n                \\nFactors You Can Control\\n                \\nDiet\\n                \\nCholesterol is found in foods that come from animal sources, such as egg yolks, meat, and cheese. Some foods have fats that raise your cholesterol level.\\n                \\nFor example, saturated fat raises your low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level more than anything else in your diet. Saturated fat is found in some meats, dairy products, chocolate, baked goods, and deep-fried and processed foods.\\n                \\nTrans fatty acids (trans fats) raise your LDL cholesterol and lower your high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Trans fats are made when hydrogen is added to vegetable oil to harden it. Trans fats are found in some fried and processed foods.\\n                \\nLimiting foods with cholesterol, saturated fat, and trans fats can help you control your cholesterol levels.\\n                \\nPhysical Activity and Weight\\n                \\nLack of physical activity can lead to weight gain. Being overweight tends to raise your LDL level, lower your HDL level, and increase your total cholesterol level. (Total cholesterol is a measure of the total amount of cholesterol in your blood, including LDL and HDL.)\\n                \\nRoutine physical activity can help you lose weight and lower your LDL cholesterol. Being physically active also can help you raise your HDL cholesterol level.\\n                \\nFactors You Cant Control\\n                \\nHeredity\\n                \\nHigh blood cholesterol can run in families. An inherited condition called familial hypercholesterolemia causes very high LDL cholesterol. (Inherited means the condition is passed from parents to children through genes.) This condition begins at birth, and it may cause a heart attack at an early age.\\n                \\nAge and Sex\\n                \\nStarting at puberty, men often have lower levels of HDL cholesterol than women. As women and men age, their LDL cholesterol levels often rise. Before age 55, women usually have lower LDL cholesterol levels than men. However, afterage 55, women can have higher LDL levels than men.', \"High blood cholesterol usually has no signs or symptoms. Thus, many people don't know that their cholesterol levels are too high.\\n                \\nIf you're 20 years old or older, have your cholesterol levels checked at least once every 5 years. Talk with your doctor about how often you should be tested.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283465.7699132}
