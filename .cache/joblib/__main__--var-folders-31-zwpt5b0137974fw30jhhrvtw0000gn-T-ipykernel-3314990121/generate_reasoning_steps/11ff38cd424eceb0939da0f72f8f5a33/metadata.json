There is no formal criteria for diagnosis yet. The term SHORT syndrome was first created to reflect several of the features of the original reported cases: Short stature, Hyperextensibility, Ocular depression (deeply set eyes), Rieger anomaly, and Teething delay. However, it is now recognized that all of these five features are neither required to make the diagnosis nor necessarily the most specific features of SHORT syndrome. The features most consistently observed in SHORT syndrome include: Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) Short stature Partial lipodystrophy Facial characteristics: Face with triangular shape, prominent forehead, deep-set eyes, nose with a narrow low-hanging tip and thin nasal alae, small chin with a central dimple and large ears that are low-set. Other frequent features include: Axenfeld-Rieger anomaly or related eye anomalies Delayed dentition Diabetes. In general, the facial features allow to make a suspicion of the diagnosis. Diagnosis is confirmed with the genetic testing showing a mutation in the PIK3R1 gene.', \"Myotonic dystrophy is an inherited condition that affects the muscles and other body systems. It is the most common form of muscular dystrophy that begins in adulthood, usually in a person's 20s or 30s. This condition is characterized by progressive muscle loss and weakness, particularly in the lower legs, hands, neck, and face. People with myotonic dystrophy often have prolonged muscle tensing (myotonia) and are not able to relax certain muscles after use. The severity of the condition varies widely among affected people, even among members of the same family. There are two types of myotonic dystrophy: myotonic dystrophy type 1 and myotonic dystrophy type 2. The symptoms in people with myotonic dystrophy type 2 tend to be milder than in those with type 1. Although both types are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, they are caused by mutations in different genes. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is caused by mutations in the DMPK gene, while type 2 is caused by mutations in the CNBP gene.\", \"What are the signs and symptoms of Myotonic dystrophy? Signs and symptoms of myotonic dystrophy often begin in a person's 20s or 30s, but they can begin at any age. Symptoms often include progressive muscle weakness and wasting (particularly in the legs, hands, neck and face); stiffness and tightness of the muscles; cataracts; and cardiac conduction defects (irregular electrical control of the heartbeat). Some affected men also have hormonal changes that may cause balding or infertility. The severity of symptoms can vary widely among affected people. The signs and symptoms of type 1 and type 2 overlap, but type 2 is generally more mild than type 1. People who are born with the condition have congenital myotonic dystrophy, which is a variation of type 1. Congenital myotonic dystophy causes weakness of all muscles, in addition to breathing problems, developmental delays and intellectual disabilities. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Myotonic dystrophy. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.\", 'What causes myotonic dystrophy? Myotonic dystrophy is caused by mutations called nucleotide repeat expansions in either the DMPK gene (in type 1) or the CNBP gene (in type 2). Nucleotide repeat expansions occur when a piece of DNA is abnormally repeated a number of times, which makes the gene unstable. In myotonic dystrophy, the gene instability leads to a series of events that ultimately prevent cells in muscles and other tissues from acting normally, leading to the features of the condition. The exact functions of these genes in not well understood. The DMPK gene may play a role in communication within cells, specifically in cells of the heart, brain, and skeletal muscles. The CNBP gene gives directions to make a protein found mainly in cells of the heart and skeletal muscles, where it is thought to regulate the activities of other genes.']}"}, "time": 1746283460.3909152}
