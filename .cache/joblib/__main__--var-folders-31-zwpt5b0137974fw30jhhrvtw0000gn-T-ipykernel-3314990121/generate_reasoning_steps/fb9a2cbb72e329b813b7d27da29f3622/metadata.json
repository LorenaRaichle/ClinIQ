Childhood hypophosphatasia, specifically, is generally diagnosed when the condition develops after six months of age but before adulthood. Signs and symptoms vary but may include delayed motor milestones; low bone mineral density for age; early loss of baby teeth (before age 5); bone and joint pain; short stature; a waddling gait; skeletal malformations; and/or unexplained broken bones. The forms of hypophosphatasia that develop during childhood are generally more mild than those that appear in infancy. Childhood hypophosphatasia is caused by changes (mutations) in the ALPL gene and can be inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is supportive and based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. Recently an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) called asfotase alfa has been show to improve bone symptoms in people with childhood hypophosphatasia and has been approved by the FDA.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Childhood hypophosphatasia? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Childhood hypophosphatasia. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal recessive inheritance - Bowing of the legs - Carious teeth - Craniosynostosis - Dolichocephaly - Elevated plasma pyrophosphate - Elevated urine pyrophosphate - Frontal bossing - Low alkaline phosphatase - Myopathy - Phosphoethanolaminuria - Premature loss of primary teeth - Proptosis - Rachitic rosary - Seizures - Short stature - Skin dimple over apex of long bone angulation - Waddling gait - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Retinal arterial macroaneurysm with supravalvular pulmonic stenosis?

It commonly involves the urinary tract, but may also involve the prostate, ureter, pelvis, bones, lungs, testes, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and kidney.  Malakoplakia of the kidney is often associated with chronic kidney infection and obstruction. E. coli  is the most common organism found in urine samples. Common symptoms of malakoplakia of the kidney include flank pain and signs of active kidney infection. It may affect one or both kidneys and can cause symptoms similar to that of kidney failure.Careful studies of the involved tissues can help to distinguish malakoplakia of the kidney from similar conditions, namely xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis and megalocytic interstitial nephritis.']}"}, "time": 1746283457.6758232}
