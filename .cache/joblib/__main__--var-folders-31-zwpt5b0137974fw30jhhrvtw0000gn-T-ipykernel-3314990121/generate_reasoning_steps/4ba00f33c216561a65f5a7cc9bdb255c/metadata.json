It causes large numbers of nerve cells in the brain to die. This affects a persons ability to remember things and think clearly. People with Alzheimers become forgetful and easily confused and may have a hard time concentrating. They may have trouble taking care of themselves and doing basic things like making meals, bathing, and getting dressed. Alzheimers varies from person to person. It can progress faster in some people than in others, and not everyone will have the same symptoms. In general, though, Alzheimers takes many years to develop, becoming increasingly severe over time. As the disease gets worse, people need more help. Eventually, they require total care. For a short overview of Alzheimers, see  Understanding Alzheimers Disease: What You Need to Know.', 'Alzheimers disease has three stages: early (also called mild), middle (moderate), and late (severe). Understanding these stages can help you care for your loved one and plan ahead. A person in the early stage of Alzheimers disease may find it hard to remember things, ask the same questions over and over, lose things, or have trouble handling money and paying bills. As Alzheimers disease progresses to the middle stage, memory loss and confusion grow worse, and people may have problems recognizing family and friends. Other symptoms at this stage may include difficulty learning new things and coping with new situations; trouble carrying out tasks that involve multiple steps, like getting dressed; forgetting the names of common things; and wandering away from home. As Alzheimers disease becomes more severe, people lose the ability to communicate. They may sleep more, lose weight, and have trouble swallowing. Often they are incontinentthey cannot control their bladder and/or bowels. Eventually, they need total care.', 'Currently, no medication can cure Alzheimers disease, but four medicines are approved to treat the symptoms of the disease. - Aricept (donezepil)for all stages of Alzheimers  - Exelon (rivastigmine)for mild to moderate Alzheimers  - Razadyne (galantamine)--for mild to moderate Alzheimers  - Namenda (memantine)for moderate to severe Alzheimers  -  Namzarec (memantine and donepezil)for moderate to severe Alzheimers Aricept (donezepil)for all stages of Alzheimers Exelon (rivastigmine)for mild to moderate Alzheimers Razadyne (galantamine)--for mild to moderate Alzheimers Namenda (memantine)for moderate to severe Alzheimers Namzarec (memantine and donepezil)for moderate to severe Alzheimers These medications can help slow down memory loss and allow people with Alzheimers to be more comfortable and independent for a longer time. If appropriate, the persons doctor may prescribe a medicine to treat behavior problems such as anxiety, depression, and aggression. Medicines to treat these behavior problems should be used only after other strategies have been tried. Talk with the doctor about which medicines are safest and most effective.', \"Here are some ways you can learn more about Alzheimers disease. - Talk with a doctor or other healthcare provider who specializes in Alzheimers disease.  - Check out books or videos about Alzheimers from the library.  - Go to educational programs about the disease.   - Visit the website of the National Institute on Aging's  Alzheimer's Disease and Referral Center (ADEAR).   - The National Institute on Aging has a book, Caring for a Person with Alzheimers Disease, that can be viewed and ordered at www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/publication/caring-person-alzheimers-disease  -  Read about  Alzheimer's disease on NIHSeniorHealth.
