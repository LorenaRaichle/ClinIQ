It means that the body (including the brain) is adapting to the presence of the drug, and the person may require a higher dosage or a different medication to get relief; this condition is known as tolerance. They may also suffer from withdrawal or feel sick when they stop taking the medication abruptly. However, the symptoms of withdrawal can usually be prevented or managed by a physician, which is why it is so important to talk to a doctor before stopping a medication. Someone who is addicted to a drug may also be physically dependent on it, but rather than benefitting from the drugs effects, an addicted person will continue to get worse with continued or increasing drug abuse. An addicted person compulsively seeks and abuses drugs, despite their negative consequences.', 'A persons behavior, especially changes in behavior, can signal a possible substance abuse problem. For example, you may notice that an older adult seems worried about whether a medicine is really working, or complains that a doctor refuses to write a prescription. He or she may have new problems doing everyday tasks or withdraw from family, friends, and normal activities. Other possible warning signs include - rapid increases in the amount of medication needed  - frequent requests for refills of certain medicines  - a person not seeming like themselves (showing a general lack of interest or being overly energetic)  - \"doctor shopping\" -- moving from provider to provider in an effort to get several prescriptions for the same medication  - use of more than one pharmacy  - false or forged prescriptions. rapid increases in the amount of medication needed frequent requests for refills of certain medicines a person not seeming like themselves (showing a general lack of interest or being overly energetic) \"doctor shopping\" -- moving from provider to provider in an effort to get several prescriptions for the same medication use of more than one pharmacy false or forged prescriptions.', 'The prescription medications most commonly abused by people of any age are opioids (painkillers), depressants, and stimulants. Doctors prescribe opioids to relieve pain and, sometimes, to treat severe coughs and diarrhea. Common opioid prescription medications include the following: - morphine (MS Contin, Kadian, Avinza), which is used before and after surgical procedures to treat severe pain  - codeine (Tylenol with Codeine, Robitussin AC), which is prescribed for mild pain  - hydrocodone (Vicodin, Lortab, Zydone), which is prescribed to relieve moderate to severe pain  - oxycodone (OxyContin, Percodan, Percocet, Tylox, Roxicet), which is used to relieve moderate to severe pain   - fentanyl (Duragesic), which is a strong pain medication typically delivered through a pain patch and prescribed for severe ongoing pain  morphine (MS Contin, Kadian, Avinza), which is used before and after surgical procedures to treat severe pain codeine (Tylenol with Codeine, Robitussin AC), which is prescribed for mild pain hydrocodone (Vicodin, Lortab, Zydone), which is prescribed to relieve moderate to severe pain oxycodone (OxyContin, Percodan, Percocet, Tylox, Roxicet), which is used to relieve moderate to severe pain fentanyl (Duragesic), which is a strong pain medication typically delivered through a pain patch and prescribed for severe ongoing pain For more on opioids, see  What Are the Possible Consequences of Opioid Use and Abuse?\" Depressants are used to treat anxiety and sleep disorders. The types of depressants that are most commonly abused are barbiturates (Secobarbital ,Mebaral and Nembutal) and benzodiazepines (Valium, Librium, and Xanax). For more on depressants, see What Are the Possible Consequences of CNS Depressant Use and Abuse?\"  Stimulants are used to treat narcolepsy (a sleep disorder), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and depression that has not responded to other treatments. These medications increase alertness, attention, and energy. Stimulants include methylphenidate (Ritalin and Concerta), and amphetamines (Adderall). For more on stimulants, see  What Are the Possible Consequences of Stimulant Use and Abuse?\"', 'Medications affect older people differently than younger people because aging changes how the body and brain handle these substances. As we age, our bodies change and cannot break down and get rid of substances as easily as before. This means that even a small amount of a medicine or a drug can have a strong effect. If you take medications the wrong way or abuse illicit drugs, this can have a serious effect on your health and make existing health problems worse. As people age, they may also become more sensitive to alcohols effects.
