Health care providers choose antibiotics that treat the infection in the small intestine and cross the blood-brain barriera layer of tissue around the brain. Using antibiotics that cross the blood-brain barrier ensures destruction of any bacteria that may have entered the patients brain and central nervous system.\\n                \\nThe health care provider usually prescribes IV antibiotics for the first 2 weeks of treatment. Most patients feel relief from symptoms within the first week or two. A nurse or technician places an IV in the patients arm to give the antibiotics. IV antibiotics used to treat Whipple disease may include\\n                \\n- ceftriaxone (Rocephin)  - meropenem (Merrem I.V.)  - penicillin G (Pfizerpen)  - streptomycin (Streptomycin)\\n                \\nAfter a patient completes the IV antibiotics, the health care provider will prescribe long-term oral antibiotics. Patients receive long-term treatmentat least 1 to 2 yearsto cure the infection anywhere in the body. Oral antibiotics may include\\n                \\n- trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Septra, Bactrim)a combination antibiotic  - doxycycline (Vibramycin)\\n                \\nPatients should finish the prescribed course of antibiotics to ensure the medication destroyed all T. whipplei bacteria in the body. Patients who feel better may still have the bacteria in the small intestine or other areas of the body for 1 to 2 years. A health care provider will monitor the patient closely, repeat the blood tests, and repeat the upper GI endoscopy with biopsy during and after treatment to determine whether T. whipplei is still present.\\n                \\nPeople may relapse during or after treatment. A health care provider will prescribe additional or new antibiotics if a relapse occurs. Some people will relapse years after treatment, so it is important for patients to schedule routine follow-ups with the health care provider. Most patients have good outcomes with an early diagnosis and complete treatment.\\n                \\nHealth care providers treat patients with neurologic symptoms at diagnosis or during relapse more aggressively. Treatment may include\\n                \\n- a combination of antibiotics  - hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil)an antimalarial medication  - weekly injections of interferon gammaa substance made by the body that activates the immune system  - corticosteroidsmedications that decrease inflammation', 'Experts have not yet found a way to prevent Whipple disease.', 'A person with Whipple disease and malabsorption may need\\n                \\n- a diet high in calories and protein  - vitamins  - nutritional supplements', '- Whipple disease is a rare bacterial infection that primarily affects the small intestine. Left untreated, Whipple disease gets worse and is usually life threatening.  - Bacteria called Tropheryma whipplei (T. whipplei) cause Whipple disease. T. whipplei infection can cause internal sores, also called lesions, and thickening of tissues in the small intestine.  - Anyone can get Whipple disease. However, it is more common in Caucasian men between 40 and 60 years old.  - Signs and symptoms of Whipple disease can vary widely from person to person. The most common symptoms of Whipple disease are      - diarrhea    - weight loss caused by malabsorption    - People with Whipple disease may have complications caused by malnutrition, which is due to damaged villi in the small intestine.  - The health care provider prescribes antibiotics to destroy the T. whipplei bacteria and treat Whipple disease.  - The health care provider usually prescribes intravenous (IV) antibiotics for the first 2 weeks of treatment. Most patients feel relief from symptoms within the first week or two.  - After a patient completes the IV antibiotics, the health care provider will prescribe long-term oral antibiotics.  - Most patients have good outcomes with an early diagnosis and complete treatment.']}"}, "time": 1746283485.236576}
