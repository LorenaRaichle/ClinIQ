It contains immature cells, called stem cells. The stem cells can develop into the red blood cells that carry oxygen through your body, the white blood cells that fight infections, and the platelets that help with blood clotting. If you have a myelodysplastic syndrome, the stem cells do not mature into healthy blood cells. Many of them die in the bone marrow. This means that you do not have enough healthy cells, which can lead to infection, anemia, or easy bleeding.    Myelodysplastic syndromes often do not cause early symptoms and are sometimes found during a routine blood test. If you have symptoms, they may include       - Shortness of breath    - Weakness or feeling tired    - Skin that is paler than usual    - Easy bruising or bleeding    - Pinpoint spots under the skin caused by bleeding    - Fever or frequent infections       Myelodysplastic syndromes are rare. People at higher risk are over 60, have had chemotherapy or radiation therapy, or have been exposed to certain chemicals. Treatment options include transfusions, drug therapy, chemotherapy, and blood or bone marrow stem cell transplants.    NIH: National Cancer Institute', 'Metabolic syndrome is a group of conditions that put you at risk for heart disease and diabetes. These conditions are        -  High blood pressure    -  High blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels    -  High levels of triglycerides, a type of fat, in your blood     -  Low levels of HDL, the good cholesterol, in your blood    -  Too much fat around your waist       Not all doctors agree on the definition or cause of metabolic syndrome. The cause might be insulin resistance. Insulin is a hormone your body produces to help you turn sugar from food into energy for your body. If you are insulin resistant, too much sugar builds up in your blood, setting the stage for disease.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Your gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ under your liver. It stores bile, a fluid made by your liver to digest fat. As your stomach and intestines digest food, your gallbladder releases bile through a tube called the common bile duct. The duct connects your gallbladder and liver to your small intestine.    Your gallbladder is most likely to give you trouble if something blocks the flow of bile through the bile ducts. That is usually a gallstone. Gallstones form when substances in bile harden. Rarely, you can also get cancer in your gallbladder.    Many gallbladder problems get better with removal of the gallbladder. Fortunately, you can live without a gallbladder. Bile has other ways of reaching your small intestine.', 'Gaucher disease is a rare, inherited disorder in which you do not have enough of an enzyme called glucocerebrosidase. This causes too much of a fatty substance to build up in your spleen, liver, lungs, bones and, sometimes, your brain. This prevents these organs from working properly.    There are three types:       - Type 1, the most common form, causes liver and spleen enlargement, bone pain and broken bones, and, sometimes, lung and kidney problems. It does not affect the brain. It can occur at any age.    - Type 2, which causes severe brain damage, appears in infants. Most children who have it die by age 2.    - In type 3, there may be liver and spleen enlargement. The brain is gradually affected. It usually starts in childhood or adolescence.       Gaucher disease has no cure. Treatment options for types 1 and 3 include medicine and enzyme replacement therapy, which is usually very effective. There is no good treatment for the brain damage of types 2 and 3.
