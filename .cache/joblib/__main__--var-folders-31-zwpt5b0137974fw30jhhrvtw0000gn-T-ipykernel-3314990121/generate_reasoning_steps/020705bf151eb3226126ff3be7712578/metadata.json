Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Spinocerebellar ataxia 14?

It is primarily characterized by short stature. Other signs and symptoms vary but may include reduced muscle strength and endurance; hypoglycemia in infancy; delayed puberty; short limbs (arms and legs); and obesity. It is often caused by changes (mutations) in the GHR gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is focused on improving growth and generally includes injections of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1).', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Laron syndrome? Laron syndrome is a rare condition in which the body is unable to use growth hormone. The primary symptom is short stature. Although affected people are generally close to average size at birth, they experience slow growth from early childhood. If left untreated, adult males with Laron syndrome typically reach a maximum height of about 4.5 feet and adult females may be just over 4 feet tall. Other signs and symptoms associated with the condition vary but may include: Reduced muscle strength and endurance Hypoglycemia in infancy Delayed puberty Small genitals Thin, fragile hair Dental abnormalities Short limbs (arms and legs) Obesity Distinctive facial features (protruding forehead, a sunken bridge of the nose, and blue sclerae) People affected by Laron syndrome appear to have a reduced risk of cancer and type 2 diabetes.
