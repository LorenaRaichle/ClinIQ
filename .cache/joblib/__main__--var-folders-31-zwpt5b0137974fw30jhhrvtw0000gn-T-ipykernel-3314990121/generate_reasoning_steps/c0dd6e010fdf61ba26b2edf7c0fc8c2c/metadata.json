The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Polyhydramnios, megalencephaly, and symptomatic epilepsy syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Hyperplasia of midface 16/16 Hypertelorism 16/16 Large forehead 16/16 Long face 16/16 Muscular hypotonia 16/16 Polyhydramnios 16/16 Thick lower lip vermilion 16/16 Thick upper lip vermilion 16/16 Wide mouth 16/16 Wide nasal bridge 16/16 Macrocephaly 15/16 Premature birth 15/16 Atria septal defect 4/16 Diabetes insipidus 2/16 Nephrocalcinosis 2/16 Autosomal recessive inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Amyloidosis is a group of diseases in which a protein, called amyloid, builds up in the body\\'s organs and tissues. Amyloidosis AA is also referred to as Secondary amyloidosis or Inflammatory amyloidosis. This disease is caused by a long-lasting infection or inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, familial Mediterranean fever, or osteomyelitis. Infection or inflammation in the body causes an increased amount of a specific protein called serum amyloid A (SAA) protein. In this disease, part of the SAA protein forms deposits called \"amyloid fibrils\". These desposits occur in the space around the cells of certain tissues of the body. Amyloidosis AA usually begins as a disease in the kidneys, but other organs can be affected such as the liver and spleen. Medical or surgical treatment of the underlying infection or inflammatory disease can slow down or stop the progression of this condition.', 'What are the most current treatments for this disease? In amyloidosis AA, the treatment depends on the underlying disease. It is important to control the chronic infection or inflammatory disease which is responsible for the amyloid. Both surgery and medication can be used to achieve successful treatment outcomes for patients. Medscape Reference provides current and comprehensive information on medical treatment options for amyloidosis AA based on the underlying inflammatory disease or infection.

However, appropriate patient selection is strongly recommended due to a higher incidence of heart failure and infections in AA individuals. Currently there is a clinical study on the safety and effectiveness of the medication KIACTA in preventing decline of renal function in patients with amyloidosis AA.

The lungs, kidneys, ovaries, and thyroid are the most commonly involved sites. Pleuropulmonary blastoma is the most commonly associated tumor and often occurs in infants and young children. Cysts in the kidneys (cystic nephroma) are also associated with DICER1 syndrome. These cysts typically develop in childhood, but do not usually cause any health problems. Women with DICER1 syndrome are at an increased risk for Sertoli-Leydig tumors of the ovaries. DICER1 syndrome is also associated with goiter (multiple fluid-filled or solid tumors in the thyroid gland). These goiters typically occur in adulthood and most often do not cause symptoms. This syndrome is caused by mutations in the DICER1 gene. It is passed through families in an autosomal dominant fashion. Affected members in the same family can be very differently affected.']}"}, "time": 1746283457.1332202}
