A test that measures immunoglobulin G (IgG) is used to determine if a person has been infected. If it is necessary to try to estimate the time of infection, which is of particular importance for pregnant women, a test which measures immunoglobulin M (IgM) is also used along with other tests such as an avidity test.\\n    \\nDiagnosis can be made by direct observation of the parasite in stained tissue sections, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or other biopsy material. These techniques are used less frequently because of the difficulty of obtaining these specimens.\\n    \\nParasites can also be isolated from blood or other body fluids (for example, CSF) but this process can be difficult and requires considerable time.\\n    \\nMolecular techniques that can detect the parasite's DNA in the amniotic fluid can be useful in cases of possible mother-to-child (congenital) transmission.\\n    \\nOcular disease is diagnosed based on the appearance of the lesions in the eye, symptoms, course of disease, and often serologic testing.\", 'Healthy people (nonpregnant)\\n    \\nMost healthy people recover from toxoplasmosis without treatment. Persons who are ill can be treated with a combination of drugs such as pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, plus folinic acid.\\n    \\n     \\n    Pregnant women, newborns, and infants\\n    \\nPregnant women, newborns, and infants can be treated, although the parasite is not eliminated completely. The parasites can remain within tissue cells in a less active phase; their location makes it difficult for the medication to completely eliminate them.\\n    \\n     \\n    Persons with ocular disease\\n    \\nPersons with ocular toxoplasmosis are sometimes prescribed medicine to treat active disease by their ophthalmologist. Whether or not medication is recommended depends on the size of the eye lesion, the location, and the characteristics of the lesion (acute active, versus chronic not progressing).\\n    \\n     \\n    Persons with compromised immune systems\\n    \\nPersons with compromised immune systems need to be treated until they have improvement in their condition. For AIDS patients, continuation of medication for the rest of their lives may be necessary, or for as long as they are immunosuppressed.\\n    \\nMore on: Resources for Health Professionals: Treatment', \"People who are healthy should follow the guidelines below to reduce risk of toxoplasmosis. If you have a weakened immune system, please see guidelines for Immunocompromised Persons.\\n   Reduce Risk from Food\\n   \\nTo prevent risk of toxoplasmosis and other infections from food:\\n   \\n    - Freeze meat for several days at sub-zero (0\u00b0 F) temperatures before cooking to greatly reduce chance of infection.\\n    - Peel or wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly before eating. \\n     \\n      \\n     \\n    - Wash cutting boards, dishes, counters, utensils, and hands with hot soapy water after contact with raw meat, poultry, seafood, or unwashed fruits or vegetables.\\n   \\n   \\nMore on: Handwashing\\n   \\nThe U.S. Government and the meat industry continue their efforts to reduce T. gondii in meat.\\n   Reduce Risk from the Environment\\n   \\nTo prevent risk of toxoplasmosis from the environment:\\n   \\n    - Avoid drinking untreated drinking water.\\n    - Wear gloves when gardening and during any contact with soil or sand because it might be contaminated with cat feces that contain Toxoplasma. Wash hands with soap and warm water after gardening or contact with soil or sand.\\n    - Teach children the importance of washing hands to prevent infection.\\n    - Keep outdoor sandboxes covered. \\n     \\n      \\n     \\n    - Feed cats only canned or dried commercial food or well-cooked table food, not raw or undercooked meats.\\n    - Change the litter box daily if you own a cat. The Toxoplasma parasite does not become infectious until 1 to 5 days after it is shed in a cat's feces. If you are pregnant or immunocompromised: \\n     \\n      - Avoid changing cat litter if possible. If no one else can perform the task, wear disposable gloves and wash your hands with soap and warm water afterwards.\\n      - Keep cats indoors.\\n      - Do not adopt or handle stray cats, especially kittens. Do not get a new cat while you are pregnant.\", 'Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease that is found in parts of the tropics, subtropics, and southern Europe. Leishmaniasis is caused by infection with Leishmania parasites, which are spread by the bite of infected sand flies. There are several different forms of leishmaniasis in people. The most common forms are cutaneous leishmaniasis, which causes skin sores, and visceral leishmaniasis, which affects several internal organs (usually spleen, liver, and bone marrow).']}"}, "time": 1746283483.821484}
