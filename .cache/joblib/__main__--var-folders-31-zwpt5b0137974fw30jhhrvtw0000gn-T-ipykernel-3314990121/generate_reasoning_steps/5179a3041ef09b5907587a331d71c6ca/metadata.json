The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Cataract Hutterite type. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal recessive inheritance - Congenital cataract - Juvenile cataract - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Intrauterine growth retardation with increased mitomycin C sensitivity?

People with this condition have a narrowing of the eye opening (blepharophimosis), droopy eyelids (ptosis), and an upward fold of the skin of the lower eyelid near the inner corner of the eye (epicanthus inversus). In addition, there is an increased distance between the inner corners of the eyes (telecanthus). Because of these eyelid malformations, the eyelids cannot open fully, and vision may be limited. BPES type 2 consists only of the eyelid malformations, whereas  BPES type 1 also causes premature ovarian failure. It is caused by mutations in the FOXL2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Treatment typically consists of various eyelid surgeries to correct the malformations.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome type 2?
