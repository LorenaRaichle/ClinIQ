People normally have 46 chromosomes in each cell. Two of the 46 chromosomes, known as X and Y, are called sex chromosomes because they help determine whether a person will develop male or female sex characteristics. Females typically have two X chromosomes (46,XX), and males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome (46,XY). 48,XXYY syndrome results from the presence of an extra copy of both sex chromosomes in each of a male's cells (48,XXYY). Extra copies of genes on the X chromosome interfere with male sexual development, preventing the testes from functioning normally and reducing the levels of testosterone. Many genes are found only on the X or Y chromosome, but genes in areas known as the pseudoautosomal regions are present on both sex chromosomes. Extra copies of genes from the pseudoautosomal regions of the extra X and Y chromosome contribute to the signs and symptoms of 48,XXYY syndrome; however, the specific genes have not been identified.[5209]\", 'Can 48,XXYY syndrome be inherited?', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Brooks Wisniewski Brown syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Brooks Wisniewski Brown syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Developmental regression 5% Agenesis of corpus callosum - Blepharophimosis - Bulbous nose - Cerebral atrophy - Cupped ear - Decreased muscle mass - Deeply set eye - Delayed speech and language development - Depressed nasal bridge - EEG abnormality - Epicanthus inversus - Esotropia - Flexion contracture - Hyperactivity - Hyperreflexia - Increased serum lactate - Intellectual disability, progressive - Intellectual disability, severe - Low posterior hairline - Low-set ears - Microcephaly - Myopia - Narrow mouth - Nystagmus - Optic atrophy - Pectus excavatum - Poor coordination - Posteriorly rotated ears - Protruding ear - Seizures - Severe postnatal growth retardation - Short palpebral fissure - Short stature - Small for gestational age - Spastic diplegia - Tapered finger - Triangular face - X-linked recessive inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', \"Encephalitis lethargica is a disease characterized by high fever, headache, double vision, delayed physical and mental response, extreme tiredness (lethargy), and sometimes coma. Patients may also experience abnormal eye movements, upper body weakness, muscule pain, tremors, neck rigidity, and behavioral changes including psychosis. A world-wide epidemic of encephalitis lethargica occurred from 1917 to 1928. The cause of this condition is unknown, and treatment depends on a person's symptoms. Levodopa and other antiparkinson drugs often produce dramatic responses.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283459.248462}
