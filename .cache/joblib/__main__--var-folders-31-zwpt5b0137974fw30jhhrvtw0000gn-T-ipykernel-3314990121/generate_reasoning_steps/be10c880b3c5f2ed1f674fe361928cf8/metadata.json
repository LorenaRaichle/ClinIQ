Hearing loss, seizures, and delayed motor development have also been reported. Swallowing and feeding difficulties early on may result in a failure to thrive. Recurrent infections of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urinary tracts are common. Vici syndrome is caused by mutations in the EPG5 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is mainly supportive.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Vici syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Vici syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Bile acid synthesis defect, congenital, 4?

Infants with achondrogenesis usually have a small body, short arms and legs, and other skeletal abnormalities that cause life-threatening complications.  There are at least three forms of achondrogenesis, type 1A, type 1B and type 2, which are distinguished by signs and symptoms, pattern of inheritance, and the results of imaging studies such as x-rays (radiology), tissue analysis (histology), and genetic testing.  Type 1A and 1B achondrogenesis are both inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.  Type 1B may be caused by mutations in the SLC26A2 gene.  Type 2 achondrogenesis is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and is caused by new (de novo) mutations in the COL2A1 gene.']}"}, "time": 1746283458.4877849}
