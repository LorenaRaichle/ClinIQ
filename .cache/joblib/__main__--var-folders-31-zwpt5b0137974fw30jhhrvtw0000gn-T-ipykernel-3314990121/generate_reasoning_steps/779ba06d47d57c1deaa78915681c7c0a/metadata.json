An arrhythmia is a problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. During an arrhythmia, the heart can beat too fast, too slow, or with an irregular rhythm.\\n                \\nAF occurs if rapid, disorganized electrical signals cause the heart\\'s two upper chamberscalled the atria (AY-tree-uh)to fibrillate. The term \"fibrillate\" means to contract very fast and irregularly.\\n                \\nIn AF, blood pools in the atria. It isn\\'t pumped completely into the heart\\'s two lower chambers, called the ventricles (VEN-trih-kuls). As a result, the heart\\'s upper and lower chambers don\\'t work together as they should.\\n                \\nPeople who have AF may not feel symptoms. However, even when AF isn\\'t noticed, it can increase the risk of stroke. In some people, AF can cause chest pain or heart failure, especially if the heart rhythm is very rapid.\\n                \\nAF may happen rarely or every now and then, or it may become an ongoing or long-term heart problem that lasts for years.\\n                \\nUnderstanding the Heart\\'s Electrical System\\n                \\nTo understand AF, it helps to understand the heart\\'s internal electrical system. The heart\\'s electrical system controls the rate and rhythm of the heartbeat.\\n                \\nWith each heartbeat, an electrical signal spreads from the top of the heart to the bottom. As the signal travels, it causes the heart to contract and pump blood.\\n                \\nEach electrical signal begins in a group of cells called the sinus node or sinoatrial (SA) node. The SA node is located in the right atrium. In a healthy adult heart at rest, the SA node sends an electrical signal to begin a new heartbeat 60 to 100 times a minute. (This rate may be slower in very fit athletes.)\\n                \\nFrom the SA node, the electrical signal travels through the right and left atria. It causes the atria to contract and pump blood into the ventricles.\\n                \\nThe electrical signal then moves down to a group of cells called the atrioventricular (AV) node, located between the atria and the ventricles. Here, the signal slows down slightly, allowing the ventricles time to finish filling with blood.\\n                \\nThe electrical signal then leaves the AV node and travels to the ventricles. It causes the ventricles to contract and pump blood to the lungs and the rest of the body. The ventricles then relax, and the heartbeat process starts all over again in the SA node.\\n                \\nFor more information about the heart\\'s electrical system and detailed animations, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index How the Heart Works article.\\n                \\nUnderstanding the Electrical Problem in Atrial Fibrillation\\n                \\nIn AF, the heart\\'s electrical signals don\\'t begin in the SA node. Instead, they begin in another part of the atria or in the nearby pulmonary veins. The signals don\\'t travel normally. They may spread throughout the atria in a rapid, disorganized way. This can cause the atria to fibrillate.\\n                \\nThe faulty signals flood the AV node with electrical impulses. As a result, the ventricles also begin to beat very fast. However, the AV node can\\'t send the signals to the ventricles as fast as they arrive. So, even though the ventricles are beating faster than normal, they aren\\'t beating as fast as the atria.\\n                \\nThus, the atria and ventricles no longer beat in a coordinated way. This creates a fast and irregular heart rhythm. In AF, the ventricles may beat 100 to 175 times a minute, in contrast to the normal rate of 60 to 100 beats a minute.\\n                \\nIf this happens, blood isn\\'t pumped into the ventricles as well as it should be. Also, the amount of blood pumped out of the ventricles to the body is based on the random atrial beats.\\n                \\nThe body may get rapid, small amounts of blood and occasional larger amounts of blood. The amount will depend on how much blood has flowed from the atria to the ventricles with each beat.\\n                \\nMost of the symptoms of AF are related to how fast the heart is beating. If medicines or age slow the heart rate, the symptoms are minimized.\\n                \\nAF may be brief, with symptoms that come and go and end on their own. Or, the condition may be ongoing and require treatment. Sometimes AF is permanent, and medicines or other treatments can\\'t restore a normal heart rhythm.\\n                \\nThe animation below shows atrial fibrillation.

This causes the atria to beat very fast and irregularly.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nPeople who have AF can live normal, active lives. For some people, treatment can restore normal heart rhythms.\\n                \\nFor people who have permanent AF, treatment can help control symptoms and prevent complications. Treatment may include medicines, medical procedures, and lifestyle changes.', \"Atrial fibrillation (AF) occurs if the heart's electrical signals don't travel through the heart in a normal way. Instead, they become very rapid and disorganized.\\n                \\nDamage to the heart's electrical system causes AF. The damage most often is the result of other conditions that affect the health of the heart, such as high blood pressure and coronary heart disease.\\n                \\nThe risk of AF increases as you age. Inflammation also is thought to play a role in causing AF.\\n                \\nSometimes, the cause of AF is unknown.\", \"Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects millions of people, and the number is rising. Men are more likely than women to have the condition. In the United States, AF is more common among Whites than African Americans or Hispanic Americans.\\n                \\nThe risk of AF increases as you age. This is mostly because your risk for heart disease and other conditions that can cause AF also increases as you age. However, about half of the people who have AF are younger than 75.\\n                \\nAF is uncommon in children.\\n                \\nMajor Risk Factors\\n                \\nAF is more common in people who have:\\n                \\nHigh blood pressure\\n                \\nCoronary heart disease (CHD)\\n                \\nHeart failure\\n                \\nRheumatic (ru-MAT-ik) heart disease\\n                \\nStructural heart defects, such as mitral valve prolapse\\n                \\nPericarditis (PER-i-kar-DI-tis; a condition in which the membrane, or sac, around your heart is inflamed)\\n                \\nCongenital heart defects\\n                \\nSick sinus syndrome (a condition in which the heart's electrical signals don't fire properly and the heart rate slows down; sometimes the heart will switch back and forth between a slow rate and a fast rate)\\n                \\nAF also is more common in people who are having heart attacks or who have just had surgery.\\n                \\nOther Risk Factors\\n                \\nOther conditions that raise your risk for AF include hyperthyroidism (too much thyroid hormone), obesity, diabetes, and lung disease.\\n                \\nCertain factors also can raise your risk for AF. For example, drinking large amounts of alcohol, especially binge drinking, raises your risk. Even modest amounts of alcohol can trigger AF in some people. Caffeine or psychological stress also may trigger AF in some people.\\n                \\nSome data suggest that people who have sleep apnea are at greater risk for AF. Sleep apnea is a common disorder that causes one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep.\\n                \\nMetabolic syndrome also raises your risk for AF. Metabolic syndrome is the name for a group of risk factors that raises your risk for CHD and other health problems, such as diabetes and stroke.\\n                \\nResearch suggests that people who receive high-dose steroid therapy are at increased risk for AF. This therapy is used for asthma and some inflammatory conditions. It may act as a trigger in people who have other AF risk factors.\\n                \\nGenetic factors also may play a role in causing AF. However, their role isn't fully known.\", \"Atrial fibrillation (AF) usually causes the heart's lower chambers, the ventricles, to contract faster than normal.\\n                \\nWhen this happens, the ventricles can't completely fill with blood. Thus, they may not be able to pump enough blood to the lungs and body.

Thus, they may not be able to pump enough blood to the lungs and body.\\n                \\nFatigue and shortness of breath are common symptoms of heart failure. A buildup of fluid in the lungs causes these symptoms. Fluid also can build up in the feet, ankles, and legs, causing weight gain.\\n                \\nLifestyle changes, medicines, and procedures or surgery (rarely, a mechanical heart pump or heart transplant) are the main treatments for heart failure.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283465.396075}
