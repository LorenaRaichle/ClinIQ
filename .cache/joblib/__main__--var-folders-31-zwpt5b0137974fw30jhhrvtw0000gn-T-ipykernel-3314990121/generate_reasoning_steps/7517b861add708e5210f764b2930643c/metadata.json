They also can help find problems early, when your chances for treatment are better. As a woman, you need some special exams and screenings. During your checkup, your health care provider will usually do:       - A pelvic exam - an exam to check if internal female organs are normal by feeling their shape and size.    - A Pap test - a test to check for cancer of the cervix, the opening to a woman's uterus. Cells from the cervix are examined under a microscope.    - A clinical breast exam - to check for breast cancer by feeling and looking at your breasts.       Your health care provider may also recommend other tests, including a mammogram or a test for HPV.\", \"Vulvar cancer is a rare type of cancer. It forms in a woman's external genitals, called the vulva. The cancer usually grows slowly over several years. First, precancerous cells grow on vulvar skin. This is called vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), or dysplasia. Not all VIN cases turn into cancer, but it is best to treat it early.    Often, vulvar cancer doesn't cause symptoms at first. However, see your doctor for testing if you notice       - A lump in the vulva    - Vulvar itching or tenderness    - Bleeding that is not your period    - Changes in the vulvar skin, such as color changes or growths that look like a wart or ulcer       You are at greater risk if you've had a human papillomavirus (HPV) infection or have a history of genital warts. Your health care provider diagnoses vulvar cancer with a physica1 exam and a biopsy. Treatment varies, depending on your overall health and how advanced the cancer is. It might include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or biologic therapy. Biologic therapy boosts your body's own ability to fight cancer.    NIH: National Cancer Institute\", 'Salmonella is the name of a group of bacteria. In the United States, it is a common cause of foodborne illness. Salmonella occurs in raw poultry, eggs, beef, and sometimes on unwashed fruit and vegetables. You also can get infected after handling pets, especially reptiles like snakes, turtles, and lizards.    Symptoms include       - Fever    - Diarrhea    - Abdominal cramps    - Headache    - Possible nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite       Symptoms usually last 4-7 days. Your health care provider diagnoses the infection with a stool test. Most people get better without treatment. Infection can be more serious in the elderly, infants, and people with chronic health problems. If Salmonella gets into the bloodstream, it can be serious. The usual treatment is antibiotics.    Typhoid fever, a more serious disease caused by Salmonella, is not common in the United States. It frequently occurs in developing countries.    NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases', 'Rotavirus is a virus that causes gastroenteritis. Symptoms include severe diarrhea, vomiting, fever, and dehydration. Almost all children in the U.S. are likely to be infected with rotavirus before their 5th birthday.    Infections happen most often in the winter and spring. It is very easy for children with the virus to spread it to other children and sometimes to adults. Once a child gets the virus, it takes about two days to become sick. Vomiting and diarrhea may last from three to eight days.    There is no medicine to treat it. To prevent dehydration, have your child drink plenty of liquids. Your health care provider may recommend oral rehydration drinks. Some children need to go to the hospital for IV fluids. Two vaccines against rotavirus infections are available.
