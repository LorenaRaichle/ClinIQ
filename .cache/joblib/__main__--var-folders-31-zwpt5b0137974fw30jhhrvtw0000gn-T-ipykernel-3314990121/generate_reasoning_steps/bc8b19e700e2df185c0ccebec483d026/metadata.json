The severity and frequency of the movements vary significantly; in some affected people, they may be barely noticeable while in others, the movements are severely disabling and painful. Dystonia can affect just one muscle, a group of muscles or all muscles of the body. Other signs and symptoms of the condition may include a tremor or other neurologic features. In juvenile-onset dystonia, specifically, affected people develop features of the condition between the ages of 13 and 20 years. The underlying cause of juvenile-onset dystonia is poorly understood in most cases. Changes (mutations) in the ACTB gene that are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner have been identified in some families with the condition. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person and may include medications, surgery, physical therapy, and other treatments to reduce or eliminate muscle spasms and pain.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Juvenile-onset dystonia? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Juvenile-onset dystonia. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of immune system physiology 90% Abnormality of the hip bone 90% Abnormality of the tongue 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Developmental regression 90% Feeding difficulties in infancy 90% Gastrointestinal dysmotility 90% High forehead 90% Hypertelorism 90% Kyphosis 90% Micromelia 90% Oral cleft 90% Scoliosis 90% Sensorineural hearing impairment 90% Short stature 90% Sprengel anomaly 90% Cataract 50% Visual impairment 50% Achalasia - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Cleft palate - Cleft upper lip - Externally rotated hips - Generalized dystonia - Hypoplastic scapulae - Intellectual disability, mild - Kyphoscoliosis - Mild global developmental delay - Small for gestational age - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Preaxial polydactyly type 4?
