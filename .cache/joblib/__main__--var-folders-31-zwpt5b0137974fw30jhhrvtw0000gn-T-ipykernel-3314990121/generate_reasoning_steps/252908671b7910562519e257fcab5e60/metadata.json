The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Progressive supranuclear palsy atypical. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal pyramidal signs - Adult onset - Dementia - Kyphoscoliosis - Morphological abnormality of the pyramidal tract - Ophthalmoparesis - Parkinsonism - Rigidity - Tremor - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', \"Bronchiolitis obliterans is an inflammatory obstruction of the lung's tiniest airways, the bronchioles. The bronchioles may become damaged and inflamed after inhalation of toxic fumes, as a result of respiratory infections, in association with connective tissue disorders, or after bone marrow or heart-lung transplants. This leads to extensive scarring that blocks the airways, leading to a dry cough, shortness of breath, fatigue and wheezing in the absence of a cold or asthma. While there is no way to reverse the disease, treatments are available to stabilize or slow the progression.   Another similarly named disease, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, is a completely different disease.\", 'What are the signs and symptoms of bronchiolitis obliterans? Bronchiolitis obliterans is characterized by a dry cough and shortness of breath which develop 2 to 8 weeks after toxic fume exposure or a respiratory illness. Fatigue and wheezing in the absence of a cold or asthma may also be noted. While high resolution chest CT scans and pulmonary function tests may help to detect bronchiolitis obliterans, a surgical lung biopsy is the most definitive way to diagnose the disease.', 'How might bronchiolitis obliterans be treated? While there is no cure for this condition, treatment with corticosteroids can help to stabilize or slow its progression. Immunosuppressive therapies and lung transplants might also be used. Treatment is most effective during the early stages of the disease. If left untreated, bronchiolitis obliterans can be fatal.']}"}, "time": 1746283457.9357948}
