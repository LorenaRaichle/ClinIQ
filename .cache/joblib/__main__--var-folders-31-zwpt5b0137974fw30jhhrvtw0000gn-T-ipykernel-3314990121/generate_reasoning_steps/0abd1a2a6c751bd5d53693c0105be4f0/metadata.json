When you are using these types of care, it may be called complementary, integrative, or alternative medicine.    Complementary medicine is used together with mainstream medical care. An example is using acupuncture to help with side effects of cancer treatment. When health care providers and facilities offer both types of care, it is called integrative medicine. Alternative medicine is used instead of mainstream medical care.    The claims that non-mainstream practitioners make can sound promising. However, researchers do not know how safe many of these treatments are or how well they work. Studies are underway to determine the safety and usefulness of many of these practices.    To minimize the health risks of a non-mainstream treatment       - Discuss it with your doctor. It might have side effects or interact with other medicines.    - Find out what the research says about it    - Choose practitioners carefully    - Tell all of your doctors and practitioners about all of the different types of treatments you use       NIH: National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health', \"Constipation means that a person has three or fewer bowel movements in a week.

There are many things you can do to prevent constipation. They include       -  Eating more fruits, vegetables and grains, which are high in fiber    -  Drinking plenty of water and other liquids    -  Getting enough exercise    -  Taking time to have a bowel movement when you need to    -  Using laxatives only if your doctor says you should    -  Asking your doctor if medicines you take may cause constipation           It's not important that you have a bowel movement every day.

NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\", 'Summary : Lice are parasitic insects that can be found on people\\'s heads and bodies. They survive by feeding on human blood. Lice found on each area of the body are different from each other. The three types of lice that live on humans are head lice, body lice (also called clothes lice), and pubic lice (\"crabs\").     Symptoms of lice may include       - Intense itching    - Rash    - Visible nits (lice eggs) or crawling lice           Lice spread most commonly by close person-to-person contact. Dogs, cats, and other pets do not spread human lice. Lice move by crawling. They cannot hop or fly. If you get lice, both over-the-counter and prescription medicines are available for treatment.    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', \"Summary : A mammogram is an x-ray picture of the breast. It can be used to check for breast cancer in women who have no signs or symptoms of the disease. It can also be used if you have a lump or other sign of breast cancer.    Screening mammography is the type of mammogram that checks you when you have no symptoms. It can help reduce the number of deaths from breast cancer among women ages 40 to 70. But it can also have drawbacks. Mammograms can sometimes find something that looks abnormal but isn't cancer. This leads to further testing and can cause you anxiety. Sometimes mammograms can miss cancer when it is there. It also exposes you to radiation. You should talk to your doctor about the benefits and drawbacks of mammograms. Together, you can decide when to start and how often to have a mammogram.    Mammograms are also recommended for younger women who have symptoms of breast cancer or who have a high risk of the disease.    When you have a mammogram, you stand in front of an x-ray machine. The person who takes the x-rays places your breast between two plastic plates. The plates press your breast and make it flat. This may be uncomfortable, but it helps get a clear picture. You should get a written report of your mammogram results within 30 days.    NIH: National Cancer Institute\"]}"}, "time": 1746283467.733578}
