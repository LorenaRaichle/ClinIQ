Occasionally be more widespread and involve other parts of the back, the shoulders and upper chest. People feel both the sensation of an itch and paresthesia (a sensation of tingling, pricking, or numbness of the skin).  There are no signs on the skin except for signs of chronic scratching and rubbing.  Amyloid deposits (a collection of a specific type of protein) may be found in skin biopsies, but this is thought to be a secondary event.  The cause of the itch in notalgia paresthetica may be due to the compression of spinal nerves by bones or muscles as the nerves emerge through the vertebrae to the back muscles.  Sometimes degenerative changes in the area of the vertebrae that innervate the affected back muscles can be seen, but not always.  Symptoms of notalgia paresthetica may respond to topical capsaicin treatment.', \"How might notalgia paresthetica be treated? While this condition may be difficult to treat, typical neuralgia therapies are often employed with moderate success. Effective measures may include:  Cooling lotions as required (camphor and menthol) Capsaicin cream - this depletes nerve endings of their chemical transmitters Local anaesthetic creams Amitriptyline tablets at night Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) Gabapentin Oxcarbazepine Botulinum toxin Phototherapy Exercise Additional information about treatment of notalgia paresthetica can be accessed by clicking here. You can find relevant journal articles on treatment of notalgia paresthetica through a service called PubMed, a searchable database of medical literature. Information on finding an article and its title, authors, and publishing details is listed here. Some articles are available as a complete document, while information on other studies is available as a summary abstract. To obtain the full article, contact a medical/university library (or your local library for interlibrary loan), or order it online using the following link. Using 'notalgia paresthetica AND treatment' as your search term should locate 10 articles.

The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Spinocerebellar ataxia 31. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Late onset 50% Gaze-evoked horizontal nystagmus 33% Sensorineural hearing impairment 7.5% Ataxia - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Cerebellar atrophy - Dysarthria - Gait ataxia - Limb ataxia - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', \"Ebstein's anomaly is a rare heart defect in which parts of the tricuspid valve (which separates the right ventricle from the right atrium) are abnormal. The abnormality causes the tricuspid valve to leak blood backwards into the right atrium. The  backup of blood flow can lead to heart swelling and fluid buildup in the lungs or liver. Sometimes, not enough blood gets out of the heart into the lungs and the person may appear blue. Symptoms range from mild to very severe. Treatment depends on the severity of the defect and may include medications, oxygen therapy, or surgery.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283455.345435}
