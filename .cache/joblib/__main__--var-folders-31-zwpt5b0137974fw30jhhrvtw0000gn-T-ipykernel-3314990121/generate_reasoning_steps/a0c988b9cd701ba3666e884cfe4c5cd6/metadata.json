Praziquantel, a prescription medication, is taken for 1-2 days to treat infections caused by all Schistosoma species.\\n    \\nMore on: Resources for Health Professionals: Treatment', 'Prevention\\n    \\nNo vaccine is available.\\n    \\nThe best way to prevent schistosomiasis is to take the following steps if you are visiting or live in an area where schistosomiasis is transmitted:\\n    \\n     - Avoid swimming or wading in freshwater when you are in countries in which schistosomiasis occurs. Swimming in the ocean and in chlorinated swimming pools is safe.\\n     - Drink safe water. Although schistosomiasis is not transmitted by swallowing contaminated water, if your mouth or lips come in contact with water containing the parasites, you could become infected. Because water coming directly from canals, lakes, rivers, streams, or springs may be contaminated with a variety of infectious organisms, you should either bring your water to a rolling boil for 1 minute or filter water before drinking it. Bring your water to a rolling boil for at least 1 minute will kill any harmful parasites, bacteria, or viruses present. Iodine treatment alone WILL NOT GUARANTEE that water is safe and free of all parasites.\\n     - Water used for bathing should be brought to a rolling boil for 1 minute to kill any cercariae, and then cooled before bathing to avoid scalding. Water held in a storage tank for at least 1 - 2 days should be safe for bathing.\\n     - Vigorous towel drying after an accidental, very brief water exposure may help to prevent the Schistosoma parasite from penetrating the skin. However, do not rely on vigorous towel drying alone to prevent schistosomiasis.\\n    \\n    \\nThose who have had contact with potentially contaminated water overseas should see their health care provider after returning from travel to discuss testing.\\n    \\nMore on: Schistosomiasis in Travelers\\n   \\n  \\n  \\n   Control\\n   \\nIn countries where schistosomiasis causes significant disease, control efforts usually focus on:\\n   \\n    - reducing the number of infections in people and/or\\n    - eliminating the snails that are required to maintain the parasite\u2019s life cycle.\\n   \\n   \\nFor all species that cause schistosomiasis, improved sanitation could reduce or eliminate transmission of this disease. In some areas with lower transmission levels, elimination of schistosomiasis is considered a \"winnable battle\" by public health officials.\\n   \\nControl measures can include mass drug treatment of entire communities and targeted treatment of school-age children. Some of the problems with control of schistosomiasis include:\\n   \\n    - Chemicals used to eliminate snails in freshwater sources may harm other species of animals in the water and, if treatment is not sustained, the snails may return to those sites afterwards.\\n    - For certain species of the parasite, such as S. japonicum, animals such as cows or water buffalo can also be infected. Runoff from pastures (if the cows are infected) can contaminate freshwater sources.', 'A single-celled parasite called Toxoplasma gondii causes a disease known as toxoplasmosis. While the parasite is found throughout the world, more than 60 million people in the United States may be infected with the Toxoplasma parasite. Of those who are infected, very few have symptoms because a healthy person\u2019s immune system usually keeps the parasite from causing illness. However, pregnant women and individuals who have compromised immune systems should be cautious; for them, a Toxoplasma infection could cause serious health problems.', \"Toxoplasmosis is caused by the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. In the United States it is estimated that 22.5% of the population 12 years and older have been infected with Toxoplasma. In various places throughout the world, it has been shown that up to 95% of some populations have been infected with Toxoplasma. Infection is often highest in areas of the world that have hot, humid climates and lower altitudes. \\n    \\nToxoplasmosis is not passed from person-to-person, except in instances of mother-to-child (congenital) transmission and blood transfusion or organ transplantation. People typically become infected by three principal routes of transmission. \\n         \\n     \\n     \\n       \\n      \\n     \\n    \\n      \\n    Foodborne transmission \\n    \\nThe tissue form of the parasite (a microscopic cyst consisting of bradyzoites) can be transmitted to humans by food. People become infected by: \\n     \\n     - Eating undercooked, contaminated meat (especially pork, lamb, and venison) \\n     - Accidental ingestion of undercooked, contaminated meat after handling it and not washing hands thoroughly (Toxoplasma cannot be absorbed through intact skin) \\n     - Eating food that was contaminated by knives, utensils, cutting boards, or other foods that had contact with raw, contaminated meat \\n     \\n    \\n      \\n    Animal-to-human (zoonotic) transmission \\n    \\nCats play an important role in the spread of toxoplasmosis. They become infected by eating infected rodents, birds, or other small animals. The parasite is then passed in the cat's feces in an oocyst form, which is microscopic. \\n    \\nKittens and cats can shed millions of oocysts in their feces for as long as 3 weeks after infection. Mature cats are less likely to shed Toxoplasma if they have been previously infected. A Toxoplasma-infected cat that is shedding the parasite in its feces contaminates the litter box. If the cat is allowed outside, it can contaminate the soil or water in the environment as well. \\n     \\n       \\n      \\n     \\n    \\nPeople can accidentally swallow the oocyst form of the parasite. People can be infected by: \\n     \\n     - Accidental ingestion of oocysts after cleaning a cat's litter box when the cat has shed Toxoplasma in its feces \\n     - Accidental ingestion of oocysts after touching or ingesting anything that has come into contact with a cat's feces that contain Toxoplasma \\n     - Accidental ingestion of oocysts in contaminated soil (e.g., not washing hands after gardening or eating unwashed fruits or vegetables from a garden) \\n     - Drinking water contaminated with the Toxoplasma parasite \\n     \\n    \\n      \\n    Mother-to-child (congenital) transmission \\n    \\nA woman who is newly infected with Toxoplasma during pregnancy can pass the infection to her unborn child (congenital infection). The woman may not have symptoms, but there can be severe consequences for the unborn child, such as diseases of the nervous system and eyes. \\n    \\n      \\n    Rare instances of transmission \\n    \\nOrgan transplant recipients can become infected by receiving an organ from a Toxoplasma-positive donor. Rarely, people can also become infected by receiving infected blood via transfusion. Laboratory workers who handle infected blood can also acquire infection through accidental inoculation.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283483.815713}
