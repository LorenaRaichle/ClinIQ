It helps make semen, the fluid that contains sperm. The prostate surrounds the tube that carries urine out of the body. As men age, their prostate grows bigger. If it gets too large, it can cause problems. An enlarged prostate is also called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Most men will get BPH as they get older. Symptoms often start after age 50.    BPH is not cancer, and it does not seem to increase your chance of getting prostate cancer. But the early symptoms are the same. Check with your doctor if you have       - A frequent and urgent need to urinate, especially at night    - Trouble starting a urine stream or making more than a dribble    - A urine stream that is weak, slow, or stops and starts several times    - The feeling that you still have to go, even just after urinating    - Small amounts of blood in your urine       Severe BPH can cause serious problems over time, such as urinary tract infections, and bladder or kidney damage. If it is found early, you are less likely to develop these problems.    Tests for BPH include a digital rectal exam, blood and imaging tests, a urine flow study, and examination with a scope called a cystoscope. Treatments include watchful waiting, medicines, nonsurgical procedures, and surgery.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain. Usually the cause is a viral infection, but bacteria can also cause it. It can be mild or severe. Most cases are mild. You may have flu-like symptoms. With a mild case, you may just need rest, plenty of fluids, and a pain reliever.    Severe cases need immediate treatment. Symptoms of severe cases include       - Severe headache    - Sudden fever    - Drowsiness     - Vomiting    - Confusion    - Seizures       In babies, additional symptoms may include constant crying, poor feeding, body stiffness, and bulging in the soft spots of the skull.    Severe cases may require a stay in the hospital. Treatments include oral and intravenous medicines to reduce inflammation and treat infection. Patients with breathing difficulties may need artificial respiration. Some people may need physical, speech, and occupational therapy once the illness is under control.     NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', \"Each year over a million people in the U.S. have a heart attack. About half of them die. Many people have permanent heart damage or die because they don't get help immediately. It's important to know the symptoms of a heart attack and call 9-1-1 if someone is having them. Those symptoms include       - Chest discomfort - pressure, squeezing, or pain     - Shortness of breath     - Discomfort in the upper body - arms, shoulder, neck, back     - Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, lightheadedness, sweating        These symptoms can sometimes be different in women.    What exactly is a heart attack? Most heart attacks happen when a clot in the coronary artery blocks the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart. Often this leads to an irregular heartbeat - called an arrhythmia - that causes a severe decrease in the pumping function of the heart. A blockage that is not treated within a few hours causes the affected heart muscle to die.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\", 'Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a group of inherited disorders that weaken connective tissues. Connective tissues are proteins that support skin, bones, blood vessels, and other organs.     EDS usually affects your skin, joints and blood vessel walls. Symptoms include       -  Loose joints     -  Fragile, small blood vessels     -  Abnormal scar formation and wound healing     -  Soft, velvety, stretchy skin that bruises easily        There are several types of EDS. They can range from mild to life-threatening. About 1 in 5,000 people has EDS. There is no cure. Treatment involves managing symptoms, often with medicines and physical therapy. It also includes learning how to protect your joints and prevent injuries.']}"}, "time": 1746283467.460636}
