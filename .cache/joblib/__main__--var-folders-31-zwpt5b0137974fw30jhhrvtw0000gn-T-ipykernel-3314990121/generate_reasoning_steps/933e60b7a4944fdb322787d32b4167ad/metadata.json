The condition usually is diagnosed after a person has been admitted to a hospital for a heart attack. If the person isn't already in a hospital, emergency treatment can start as soon as medical personnel arrive.\\n                \\nThe first goal of emergency treatment for cardiogenic shock is to improve the flow of blood and oxygen to the bodys organs.\\n                \\nSometimes both the shock and its cause are treated at the same time. For example, doctors may quickly open a blocked blood vessel that's damaging the heart. Often, this can get the patient out of shock with little or no additional treatment.\\n                \\nEmergency Life Support\\n                \\nEmergency life support treatment is needed for any type of shock. This treatment helps get oxygen-rich blood flowing to the brain, kidneys, and other organs.\\n                \\nRestoring blood flow to the organs keeps the patient alive and may prevent long-term damage to the organs. Emergency life support treatment includes:\\n                \\nGiving the patient extra oxygen to breathe so that more oxygen reaches the lungs, the heart, and the rest of the body.\\n                \\nProviding breathing support if needed. A ventilator might be used to protect the airway and provide the patient with extra oxygen. A ventilator is a machine that supports breathing.\\n                \\nGiving the patient fluids, including blood and blood products, through a needle inserted in a vein (when the shock is due to blood loss). This can help get more blood to major organs and the rest of the body. This treatment usually isnt used for cardiogenic shock because the heart can't pump the blood that's already in the body. Also, too much fluid is in the lungs, making it hard to breathe.\\n                \\nMedicines\\n                \\nDuring and after emergency life support treatment, doctors will try to find out whats causing the shock. If the reason for the shock is that the heart isn't pumping strongly enough, then the diagnosis is cardiogenic shock.\\n                \\nTreatment for cardiogenic shock will depend on its cause. Doctors may prescribe medicines to:\\n                \\nPrevent blood clots from forming\\n                \\nIncrease the force with which the heart muscle contracts\\n                \\nTreat a heart attack\\n                \\nMedical Devices\\n                \\nMedical devices can help the heart pump and improve blood flow. Devices used to treat cardiogenic shock may include:\\n                \\nAn intra-aortic balloon pump. This device is placed in the aorta, the main blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the body. A balloon at the tip of the device is inflated and deflated in a rhythm that matches the hearts pumping rhythm. This allows the weakened heart muscle to pump as much blood as it can, which helps get more blood to vital organs, such as the brain and kidneys.\\n                \\nA left ventricular assist device (LVAD). This device is a battery-operated pump that takes over part of the hearts pumping action. An LVAD helps the heart pump blood to the body. This device may be used if damage to the left ventricle, the hearts main pumping chamber, is causing shock.\\n                \\nMedical Procedures and Surgery\\n                \\nSometimes medicines and medical devices aren't enough to treat cardiogenic shock.\\n                \\nMedical procedures and surgery can restore blood flow to the heart and the rest of the body, repair heart damage, and help keep a patient alive while he or she recovers from shock.\\n                \\nSurgery also can improve the chances of long-term survival. Surgery done within 6 hours of the onset of shock symptoms has the greatest chance of improving survival.\\n                \\nThe types of procedures and surgery used to treat underlying causes of cardiogenic shock include:\\n                \\nPercutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and stents. PCI,also known as coronary angioplasty,is a procedure used to open narrowed or blocked coronary (heart) arteries and treat an ongoing heart attack. A stent is a small mesh tube that's placed in a coronary artery during PCI to help keep it open.\\n                \\nCoronary artery bypass grafting. For this surgery, arteries or veins from other parts of the body are used to bypass (that is, go around) narrowed coronary arteries. This creates a new passage for oxygen-rich blood to reach the heart.\\n                \\nSurgery to repair damaged heart valves.\\n                \\nSurgery to repair a break in the wall that separates the hearts chambers. This break is called a septal rupture.\\n                \\nHeart transplant. This type of surgery rarely is done during an emergency situation like cardiogenic shock because of other available options. Also, doctors need to do very careful testing to make sure a patient will benefit from a heart transplant and to find a matching heart from a donor. Still, in some cases, doctors may recommend a transplant if they feel it's the best way to improve a patient's chances of long-term survival.\", 'The best way to prevent cardiogenic shock is to lower your risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) and heart attack. (For more information, go to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\'s \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.\")\\n                \\nIf you already have CHD, its important to get ongoing treatment from a doctor who has experience treating heart problems.\\n                \\nIf you have a heart attack, you should get treatment right away to try to prevent cardiogenic shock and other possible complications.\\n                \\nAct in time. Know the warning signs of a heart attack so you can act fast to get treatment. Many heart attack victims wait 2 hours or more after their symptoms begin before they seek medical help. Delays in treatment increase the risk of complications and death.\\n                \\nIf you think you\\'re having a heart attack, call 911 for help. Don\\'t drive yourself or have friends or family drive you to the hospital. Call an ambulance so that medical personnel can begin life-saving treatment on the way to the emergency room.', \"Espaol\\n                \\nAnemia (uh-NEE-me-uh) is a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal number of red blood cells.\\n                \\nAnemia also can occur if your red blood cells don't contain enough hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin). Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that gives blood its red color. This protein helps red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.\\n                \\nIf you have anemia, your body doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. As a result, you may feel tired or weak. You also may have other symptoms, such as shortness of breath, dizziness, or headaches.\\n                \\nSevere or long-lasting anemia can damage your heart, brain, and other organs in your body. Very severe anemia may even cause death.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nBlood is made up of many parts, including red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets (PLATE-lets), and plasma (the fluid portion of blood).\\n                \\nRed blood cells are disc-shaped and look like doughnuts without holes in the center. They carry oxygen and remove carbon dioxide (a waste product) from your body. These cells are made in the bone marrowa sponge-like tissue inside the bones.\\n                \\nWhite blood cells and platelets (PLATE-lets) also are made in the bone marrow. White blood cells help fight infection. Platelets stick together to seal small cuts or breaks on the blood vessel walls and stop bleeding. With some types of anemia, you may have low numbers of all three types of blood cells.\\n                \\nAnemia has three main causes: blood loss, lack of red blood cell production, or high rates of red blood cell destruction. These causes might be the result of diseases, conditions, or other factors.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nMany types of anemia can be mild, short term, and easily treated. You can even prevent some types with a healthy diet. Other types can be treated with dietary supplements.\\n                \\nHowever, certain types of anemia can be severe, long lasting, and even life threatening if not diagnosed and treated.\\n                \\nIf you have signs or symptoms of anemia, see your doctor to find out whether you have the condition. Treatment will depend on the cause of the anemia and how severe it is.\", 'The three main causes of anemia are:\\n                \\nBlood loss\\n                \\nLack of red blood cell production\\n                \\nHigh rates of red blood cell destruction\\n                \\nFor some people, the condition is caused by more than one of these factors.\\n                \\nBlood Loss\\n                \\nBlood loss is the most common cause of anemia, especially iron-deficiency anemia. Blood loss can be short term or persist over time.\\n                \\nHeavy menstrual periods or bleeding in the digestive or urinary tract can cause blood loss. Surgery, trauma, or cancer also can cause blood loss.\\n                \\nIf a lot of blood is lost, the body may lose enough red blood cells to cause anemia.\\n                \\nLack of Red Blood Cell Production\\n                \\nBoth acquired and inherited conditions and factors can prevent your body from making enough red blood cells. \"Acquired\" means you aren\\'t born with the condition, but you develop it. \"Inherited\" means your parents passed the gene for the condition on to you.\\n                \\nAcquired conditions and factors that can lead to anemia include poor diet, abnormal hormone levels, some chronic (ongoing) diseases, and pregnancy.\\n                \\nAplastic anemia also can prevent your body from making enough red blood cells. This condition can be acquired or inherited.\\n                \\nDiet\\n                \\nA diet that lacks iron, folic acid (folate), or vitamin B12 can prevent your body from making enough red blood cells. Your body also needs small amounts of vitamin C, riboflavin, and copper to make red blood cells.\\n                \\nConditions that make it hard for your body to absorb nutrients also can prevent your body from making enough red blood cells.\\n                \\nHormones\\n                \\nYour body needs the hormone erythropoietin (eh-rith-ro-POY-eh-tin) to make red blood cells. This hormone stimulates the bone marrow to make these cells. A low level of this hormone can lead to anemia.\\n                \\nDiseases and Disease Treatments\\n                \\nChronic diseases, like kidney disease and cancer, can make it hard for your body to make enough red blood cells.\\n                \\nSome cancer treatments may damage the bone marrow or damage the red blood cells\\' ability to carry oxygen. If the bone marrow is damaged, it can\\'t make red blood cells fast enough to replace the ones that die or are destroyed.\\n                \\nPeople who have HIV/AIDS may develop anemia due to infections or medicines used to treat their diseases.\\n                \\nPregnancy\\n                \\nAnemia can occur during pregnancy due to low levels of iron and folic acid and changes in the blood.\\n                \\nDuring the first 6 months of pregnancy, the fluid portion of a woman\\'s blood (the plasma) increases faster than the number of red blood cells. This dilutes the blood and can lead to anemia.\\n                \\nAplastic Anemia\\n                \\nSome infants are born without the ability to make enough red blood cells. This condition is called aplastic anemia. Infants and children who have aplastic anemia often need blood transfusions to increase the number of red blood cells in their blood.\\n                \\nAcquired conditions or factors, such as certain medicines, toxins, and infectious diseases, also can cause aplastic anemia.\\n                \\nHigh Rates of Red Blood Cell Destruction\\n                \\nBoth acquired and inherited conditions and factors can cause your body to destroy too many red blood cells. One example of an acquired condition is an enlarged or diseased spleen.\\n                \\nThe spleen is an organ that removes wornout red blood cells from the body. If the spleen is enlarged or diseased, it may remove more red blood cells than normal, causing anemia.\\n                \\nExamples of inherited conditions that can cause your body to destroy too many red blood cells include sickle cell anemia, thalassemias, and lack of certain enzymes. These conditions create defects in the red blood cells that cause them to die faster than healthy red blood cells.\\n                \\nHemolytic anemia is another example of a condition in which your body destroys too many red blood cells. Inherited or acquired conditions or factors can cause hemolytic anemia. Examples include immune disorders, infections, certain medicines, or reactions to blood transfusions.']}"}, "time": 1746283465.360014}
