The exact underlying cause of alopecia universalis (AU) is not currently known. AU is an advanced form of alopecia areata (AA), a condition that leads to round patches of hair loss. AA is thought to be an autoimmune condition in which an affected person's immune system mistakenly attacks the hair follicles. Genetic studies have found that AA and AU are associated with several immune-related genes; however, they are likely complex disorders caused by the interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors. This means that even if someone inherits a genetic predisposition to the condition, they may not become affected unless something in the environment triggers the onset of the condition.\", 'Is alopecia universalis inherited? Alopecia universalis is believed to be a multifactorial condition, which means it is caused by a combination of environmental influences and genetic predisposition. While a predisposition can be inherited and some affected people have a family history, the condition itself is not thought to be inherited.', 'How is alopecia universalis diagnosed? A diagnosis of alopecia universalis is usually based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. In rare cases, a scalp biopsy may be needed to confirm the diagnosis.', 'How might alopecia universalis be treated? Although these is no therapy approved for the treatment of alopecia universalis, some people find that medications approved for other purposes may help hair grow back, at least temporarily. Since alopecia universalis is one of the more severe types of alopecia areata, treatment options are somewhat limited. The most common treatments include corticosteriods and topical (applied to the skin) immunotherapy. There are possible side effects of corticosteriods which should be discussed with a physician. Also, regrown hair is likely to fall out when the corticosteriods are stopped. About 40% of people treated with topical immunotherapy will regrow scalp hair after about six months of treatment. Those who do successfully regrow scalp hair need to continue the treatment to maintain the hair regrowth. While these treatments may promote hair growth, they do not prevent new loss or cure the underlying disease. For those who do not respond to treatment, wigs are an option.']}"}, "time": 1746283459.145281}
