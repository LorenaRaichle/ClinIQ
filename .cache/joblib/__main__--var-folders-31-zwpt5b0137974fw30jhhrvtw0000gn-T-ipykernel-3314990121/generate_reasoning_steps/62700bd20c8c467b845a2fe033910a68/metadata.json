People who have severe hemolytic anemia usually need ongoing treatment. Severe hemolytic anemia can be fatal if it's not properly treated.\\n                \\nGoals of Treatment\\n                \\nThe goals of treating hemolytic anemia include:\\n                \\nReducing or stopping the destruction of red blood cells\\n                \\nIncreasing the red blood cell count to an acceptable level\\n                \\nTreating the underlying cause of the condition\\n                \\nTreatment will depend on the type, cause, and severity of the hemolytic anemia you have. Your doctor also will consider your age, overall health, and medical history.\\n                \\nIf you have an inherited form of hemolytic anemia, it's a lifelong condition that may require ongoing treatment. If you have an acquired form of hemolytic anemia, it may go away if its cause can be found and corrected.\\n                \\nBlood Transfusions\\n                \\nBlood transfusions are used to treat severe or life-threatening hemolytic anemia.\\n                \\nA blood transfusion is a common procedure in which blood is given to you through an intravenous (IV) line in one of your blood vessels. Transfusions require careful matching of donated blood with the recipient's blood.\\n                \\nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Blood Transfusion article.\\n                \\nMedicines\\n                \\nMedicines can improve some types of hemolytic anemia, especially autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Corticosteroid medicines, such as prednisone, can stop your immune system from, or limit its ability to, make antibodies (proteins) against red blood cells.\\n                \\nIf you don't respond to corticosteroids, your doctor may prescribe other medicines to suppress your immune system. Examples include the medicines rituximab and cyclosporine.\\n                \\nIf you have severe sickle cell anemia, your doctor may recommend a medicine called hydroxyurea. This medicine prompts your body to make fetal hemoglobin. Fetal hemoglobin is the type of hemoglobin that newborns have.\\n                \\nIn people who have sickle cell anemia, fetal hemoglobin helps prevent red blood cells from sickling and improves anemia.\\n                \\nPlasmapheresis\\n                \\nPlasmapheresis is a procedure that removes antibodies from the blood. For this procedure, blood is taken from your body using a needle inserted into a vein.\\n                \\nThe plasma, which contains the antibodies, is separated from the rest of the blood. Then, plasma from a donor and the rest of the blood is put back in your body.\\n                \\nThis treatment may help if other treatments for immune hemolytic anemia don't work.\\n                \\nSurgery\\n                \\nSome people who have hemolytic anemia may need surgery to remove their spleens. The spleen is an organ in the abdomen. A healthy spleen helps fight infection and filters out old or damaged blood cells.\\n                \\nAn enlarged or diseased spleen may remove more red blood cells than normal, causing anemia. Removing the spleen can stop or reduce high rates of red blood cell destruction.\\n                \\nBlood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant\\n                \\nIn some types of hemolytic anemia, such as thalassemias, the bone marrow doesn't make enough healthy red blood cells. The red blood cells it does make may be destroyed before their normal lifespan is over. Blood and marrow stem cell transplants may be used to treat these types of hemolytic anemia.\\n                \\nA blood and marrow stem cell transplant replaces damaged stem cells with healthy ones from another person (a donor).\\n                \\nDuring the transplant, which is like a blood transfusion, you get donated stem cells through a tube placed in a vein. Once the stem cells are in your body, they travel to your bone marrow and begin making new blood cells.\\n                \\nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant article.\\n                \\nLifestyle Changes\\n                \\nIf you have AIHA with cold-reactive antibodies, try to avoid cold temperatures. This can help prevent the breakdown of red blood cells. It's very important to protect your fingers, toes, and ears from the cold.\\n                \\nTo protect yourself, you can:\\n                \\nWear gloves or mittens when taking food out of the refrigerator or freezer.\\n                \\nWear a hat, scarf, and a coat with snug cuffs during cold weather.\\n                \\nTurn down air conditioning or dress warmly while in air-conditioned spaces.\\n                \\nWarm up the car before driving in cold weather.\\n                \\nPeople born with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency can avoid substances that may trigger anemia. For example, avoid fava beans, naphthalene (a substance found in some moth balls), and certain medicines (as your doctor advises).\", 'You can\\'t prevent inherited types of hemolytic anemia. One exception is glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.\\n                \\nIf you\\'re born with G6PD deficiency, you can avoid substances that may trigger the condition. For example, avoid fava beans, naphthalene (a substance found in some moth balls), and certain medicines (as your doctor advises).\\n                \\nSome types of acquired hemolytic anemia can be prevented. For example, reactions to blood transfusions, which can cause hemolytic anemia, can be prevented. This requires careful matching of blood types between the blood donor and the recipient.\\n                \\nPrompt and proper prenatal care can help you avoid the problems of Rh incompatibility. This condition can occur during pregnancy if a woman has Rh-negative blood and her baby has Rh-positive blood. \"Rh-negative\" and \"Rh-positive\" refer to whether your blood has Rh factor. Rh factor is a protein on red blood cells.\\n                \\nRh incompatibility can lead to hemolytic anemia in a fetus or newborn.', \"Pulmonary embolism (PULL-mun-ary EM-bo-lizm), or PE, is a sudden blockage in a lung artery. The blockage usually is caused by a blood clot that travels to the lung from a vein in the leg.\\n                \\nA clot that forms in one part of the body and travels in the bloodstream to another part of the body is called an embolus (EM-bo-lus).\\n                \\nPE is a serious condition that can:\\n                \\nDamage part of your lung because of a lack of blood flow to your lung tissue. This damage may lead to pulmonary hypertension (increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries).\\n                \\nCause low oxygen levels in your blood.\\n                \\nDamage other organs in your body because of a lack of oxygen.\\n                \\nIf a blood clot is large, or if there are many clots, PE can cause death.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nPE most often is a complication of a condition called deep vein thrombosis (DVT). In DVT, blood clots form in the deep veins of the bodymost often in the legs. These clots can break free, travel through the bloodstream to the lungs, and block an artery.\\n                \\nDeep vein clots are not like clots in veins close to the skin's surface. Those clots remain in place and do not cause PE.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nThe exact number of people affected by DVT and PE isn't known. Estimates suggest these conditions affect 300,000 to 600,000 people in the United States each year.\\n                \\nIf left untreated, about 30 percent of patients who have PE will die. Most of those who die do so within the first few hours of the event.\\n                \\nThe good news is that a prompt diagnosis and proper treatment can save lives and help prevent the complications of PE.\", 'Major Causes\\n                \\nPulmonary embolism (PE) usually begins as a blood clot in a deep vein of the leg. This condition is called deep vein thrombosis. The clot can break free, travel through the bloodstream to the lungs, and block an artery.\\n                \\nThe animation below shows how a blood clot from a deep vein in the leg can travel to the lungs, causing pulmonary embolism.

This can happen if you don\\'t move around for long periods, such as:\\n                \\nAfter some types of surgery\\n                \\nDuring a long trip in a car or airplane\\n                \\nIf you must stay in bed for an extended time\\n                \\nBlood clots are more likely to develop in veins damaged from surgery or injured in other ways.\\n                \\nOther Causes\\n                \\nRarely, an air bubble, part of a tumor, or other tissue travels to the lungs and causes PE. Also, if a large bone in the body (such as the thigh bone) breaks, fat from the bone marrow can travel through the blood. If the fat reaches the lungs, it can cause PE']}"}, "time": 1746283466.1170628}
