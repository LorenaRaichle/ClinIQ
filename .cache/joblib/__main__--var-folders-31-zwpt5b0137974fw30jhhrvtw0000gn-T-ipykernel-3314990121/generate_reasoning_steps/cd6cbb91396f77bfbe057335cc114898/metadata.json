The part most commonly affected is the end part of the small intestine, called the ileum.\\n                \\n*See the Pronunciation Guide for tips on how to say the words in bold type.\\n                \\nCrohns disease is one of two main forms of diseases of the GI tract named inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The other form, called ulcerative colitis, affects the large intestine, which includes the colon and the rectumthe lower end of the large intestine, leading to the anus.\\n                \\nWith Crohns disease, chronicor long lastinginflammation may cause scar tissue to form in the lining of the intestine. When scar tissue builds up, the passage can become narrow, causing food and stool to move through the GI tract more slowlywhich can lead to pain, cramps, and diarrhea.\", \"Both men and women can get Crohn's disease, and it can run in families. People with Crohns disease may have a blood relative with the disease or another type of IBD. Crohns disease most commonly starts between the ages of 13 and 30.\", 'Researchers are studying the possible causes of Crohns disease. Your bodys natural defense system, called the immune system, protects you from infection by fighting against bacteria, viruses, and other things that can make you sick. Researchers believe that with Crohns disease, the immune system attacks harmless bacteria and viruses. During the attack, white blood cells gather in the intestinal lining. The white blood cells cause chronic inflammation, which leads to ulcers, or sores, and damage to the intestines.\\n                \\nOther factors associated with Crohns disease are\\n                \\n- genesthe traits passed down from your parents  - unknown triggers caused by the environment', \"Crohn's disease symptoms can be different for each person. The most common symptoms of Crohns disease are\\n                \\n- abdominal painoften in the lower right area of the abdomen  - diarrhea  - bleeding in the rectum, which can be seen in a persons underwear, in the toilet, or in a bowel movement; rectal bleeding can be serious and may not stop without medical help  - weight loss  - fever\"]}"}, "time": 1746283485.241146}
