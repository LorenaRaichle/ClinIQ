The viruses pass through the air and enter your body through your nose or mouth. Between 5% and 20% of people in the U.S. get the flu each year. The flu can be serious or even deadly for elderly people, newborn babies, and people with certain chronic illnesses.    Symptoms of the flu come on suddenly and are worse than those of the common cold. They may include        - Body or muscle aches    - Chills     - Cough     - Fever     - Headache     - Sore throat        Is it a cold or the flu? Colds rarely cause a fever or headaches. Flu almost never causes an upset stomach. And \"stomach flu\" isn\\'t really flu at all, but gastroenteritis.    Most people with the flu recover on their own without medical care. People with mild cases of the flu should stay home and avoid contact with others, except to get medical care. If you get the flu, your health care provider may prescribe medicine to help your body fight the infection and lessen symptoms.     The main way to keep from getting the flu is to get a yearly flu vaccine. Good hygiene, including hand washing, can also help.    NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases', 'Regular health exams and tests can help find problems before they start. They also can help find problems early, when your chances for treatment and cure are better. Which exams and screenings you need depends on your age, health and family history, and lifestyle choices such as what you eat, how active you are, and whether you smoke.    To make the most of your next check-up, here are some things to do before you go:       - Review your family health history    - Find out if you are due for any general screenings or vaccinations    - Write down a list of issues and questions to take with you       Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Summary : Exercise and physical activity are good for just about everyone, including older adults. There are four main types and each type is different. Doing them all will give you more benefits.       - Endurance, or aerobic, activities increase your breathing and heart rate. Brisk walking or jogging, dancing, swimming, and biking are examples.    - Strength exercises make your muscles stronger. Lifting weights or using a resistance band can build strength.    - Balance exercises help prevent falls    - Flexibility exercises stretch your muscles and can help your body stay limber       NIH: National Institute on Aging', \"Everyone feels tired now and then. Sometimes you may just want to stay in bed. But, after a good night's sleep, most people feel refreshed and ready to face a new day. If you continue to feel tired for weeks, it's time to see your doctor. He or she may be able to help you find out what's causing your fatigue and recommend ways to relieve it.    Fatigue itself is not a disease. Medical problems, treatments, and personal habits can add to fatigue. These include       - Taking certain medicines, such as antidepressants, antihistamines, and medicines for nausea and pain    - Having medical treatments, like chemotherapy and radiation    - Recovering from major surgery    - Anxiety, stress, or depression    - Staying up too late    - Drinking too much alcohol or too many caffeinated drinks    - Pregnancy       One disorder that causes extreme fatigue is chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). This fatigue is not the kind of tired feeling that goes away after you rest. Instead, it lasts a long time and limits your ability to do ordinary daily activities.
