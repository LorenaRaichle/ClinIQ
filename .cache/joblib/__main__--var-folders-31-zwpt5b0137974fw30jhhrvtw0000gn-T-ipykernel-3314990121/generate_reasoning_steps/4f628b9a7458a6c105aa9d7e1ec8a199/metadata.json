As a result, blood clots can form more easily. These clots can block blood flow through your arteries and veins, which can cause a heart attack or stroke.\\n                \\nThicker blood also doesn't flow as quickly to your body as normal blood. Slowed blood flow prevents your organs from getting enough oxygen, which can cause serious problems, such as angina (an-JI-nuh or AN-juh-nuh) and heart failure. (Angina is chest pain or discomfort.)\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nRed blood cells carry oxygen to all parts of your body. They also remove carbon dioxide (a waste product) from your body's cells and carry it to the lungs to be exhaled.\\n                \\nRed blood cells are made in your bone marrowa sponge-like tissue inside the bones. White blood cells and platelets (PLATE-lets) also are made in your bone marrow. White blood cells help fight infection. Platelets stick together to seal small cuts or breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding.\\n                \\nIf you have PV, your bone marrow makes too many red blood cells. It also can make too many white blood cells and platelets.\\n                \\nA mutation, or change, in the body's JAK2 gene is the major cause of PV. This gene makes a protein that helps the body produce blood cells. What causes the change in the JAK2 gene isn't known. PV generally isn't inheritedthat is, passed from parents to children through genes.\\n                \\nPV develops slowly and may not cause symptoms for years. The disease often is found during routine blood tests done for other reasons.\\n                \\nWhen signs and symptoms are present, they're the result of the thick blood that occurs with PV. This thickness slows the flow of oxygen-rich blood to all parts of your body. Without enough oxygen, many parts of your body won't work normally.\\n                \\nFor example, slower blood flow deprives your arms, legs, lungs, and eyes of the oxygen they need. This can cause headaches, dizziness, itching, and vision problems, such as blurred or double vision.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nPV is a serious, chronic (ongoing) disease that can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated. PV has no cure, but treatments can help control the disease and its complications.\\n                \\nPV is treated with procedures, medicines, and other methods. You may need one or more treatments to manage the disease.\", \"Primary Polycythemia\\n                \\nPolycythemia vera (PV) also is known as primary polycythemia. A mutation, or change, in the body's JAK2 gene is the main cause of PV. The JAK2 gene makes a protein that helps the body produce blood cells.\\n                \\nWhat causes the change in the JAK2 gene isn't known. PV generally isn't inheritedthat is, passed from parents to children through genes. However, in some families, the JAK2 gene may have a tendency to mutate. Other, unknown genetic factors also may play a role in causing PV.\\n                \\nSecondary Polycythemia\\n                \\nAnother type of polycythemia, called secondary polycythemia, isn't related to the JAK2 gene. Long-term exposure to low oxygen levels causes secondary polycythemia.\\n                \\nA lack of oxygen over a long period can cause your body to make more of the hormone erythropoietin (EPO). High levels of EPO can prompt your body to make more red blood cells than normal. This leads to thicker blood, as seen in PV.\\n                \\nPeople who have severe heart or lung disease may develop secondary polycythemia. People who smoke, spend long hours at high altitudes, or are exposed to high levels of carbon monoxide where they work or live also are at risk.\\n                \\nFor example, working in an underground parking garage or living in a home with a poorly vented fireplace or furnace can raise your risk for secondary polycythemia.\\n                \\nRarely, tumors can make and release EPO, or certain blood problems can cause the body to make more EPO.\\n                \\nSometimes doctors can cure secondary polycythemiait depends on whether the underlying cause can be stopped, controlled, or cured.\", \"Polycythemia vera (PV) is a rare blood disease. The disease affects people of all ages, but it's most common in adults who are older than 60. PV is rare in children and young adults. Men are at slightly higher risk for PV than women.\", \"Polycythemia vera (PV) develops slowly. The disease may not cause signs or symptoms for years.\\n                \\nWhen signs and symptoms are present, they're the result of the thick blood that occurs with PV. This thickness slows the flow of oxygen-rich blood to all parts of your body. Without enough oxygen, many parts of your body won't work normally.\\n                \\nThe signs and symptoms of PV include:\\n                \\nHeadaches, dizziness, and weakness\\n                \\nShortness of breath and problems breathing while lying down\\n                \\nFeelings of pressure or fullness on the left side of the abdomen due to an enlarged spleen (an organ in the abdomen)\\n                \\nDouble or blurred vision and blind spots\\n                \\nItching all over (especially after a warm bath), reddened face, and a burning feeling on your skin (especially your hands and feet)\\n                \\nBleeding from your gums and heavy bleeding from small cuts\\n                \\nUnexplained weight loss\\n                \\nFatigue (tiredness)\\n                \\nExcessive sweating\\n                \\nVery painful swelling in a single joint, usually the big toe (called gouty arthritis)\\n                \\nIn rare cases, people who have PV may have pain in their bones.\\n                \\nPolycythemia Vera Complications\\n                \\nIf you have PV, the thickness of your blood and the slowed blood flow can cause serious health problems.\\n                \\nBlood clots are the most serious complication of PV. Blood clots can cause a heart attack or stroke. They also can cause your liver and spleen to enlarge. Blood clots in the liver and spleen can cause sudden, intense pain.\\n                \\nSlowed blood flow also prevents enough oxygen-rich blood from reaching your organs. This can lead to angina (chest pain or discomfort) and heart failure. The high levels of red blood cells that PV causes can lead to stomach ulcers, gout, or kidney stones.\\n                \\nSome people who have PV may develop myelofibrosis (MY-e-lo-fi-BRO-sis). This is a condition in which your bone marrow is replaced with scar tissue. Abnormal bone marrow cells may begin to grow out of control.\\n                \\nThis abnormal growth can lead to acute myelogenous (my-eh-LOJ-eh-nus) leukemia (AML), a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. This disease can worsen very quickly.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283465.931594}
