It can be in a variety of raw foods as well as in processed foods and foods made from unpasteurized milk. Listeria is unlike many other germs because it can grow even in the cold temperature of the refrigerator.     Symptoms include fever and chills, headache, upset stomach and vomiting. Treatment is with antibiotics.    Anyone can get the illness. But it is most likely to affect pregnant women and unborn babies, older adults, and people with weak immune systems. To reduce your risk       - Use precooked and ready-to-eat foods as soon as you can     -  Avoid raw milk and raw milk products    -  Heat ready-to-eat foods and leftovers until they are steaming hot    -  Wash fresh fruits and vegetables     -  Avoid rare meat and refrigerated smoked seafood       Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', \"You've probably heard that high blood pressure is a problem. Sometimes blood pressure that is too low can also cause problems.    Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Each time your heart beats, it pumps out blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is highest when your heart beats, pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest, between beats, your blood pressure falls. This is the diastolic pressure. Your blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually they're written one above or before the other, such as 120/80. If your blood pressure reading is 90/60 or lower, you have low blood pressure.     Some people have low blood pressure all the time. They have no symptoms and their low readings are normal for them. In other people, blood pressure drops below normal because of a medical condition or certain medicines. Some people may have symptoms of low blood pressure when standing up too quickly. Low blood pressure is a problem only if it causes dizziness, fainting or in extreme cases, shock.

In the United States, it is often done before a new baby leaves the hospital. There are medical benefits and risks to circumcision. Possible benefits include a lower risk of urinary tract infections, penile cancer and sexually transmitted diseases. The risks include pain and a low risk of bleeding or infection.    The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) found that the medical benefits of circumcision outweigh the risks. They recommend that parents make this decision in consultation with their pediatrician. Parents need to decide what is best for their sons, based on their religious, cultural and personal preferences.', \"Your colon, also known as the large intestine, is part of your digestive system. It's a long, hollow tube at the end of your digestive tract where your body makes and stores stool. Many disorders affect the colon's ability to work properly. Some of these include       - Colorectal cancer     -  Colonic polyps - extra tissue growing in the colon that can become cancerous    -  Ulcerative colitis - ulcers of the colon and rectum    -  Diverticulitis - inflammation or infection of pouches in the colon    -  Irritable bowel syndrome - an uncomfortable condition causing abdominal cramping and other symptoms       Treatment for colonic diseases varies greatly depending on the disease and its severity. Treatment may involve diet, medicines and in some cases, surgery.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\"]}"}, "time": 1746283466.6119208}
