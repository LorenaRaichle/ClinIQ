The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Hemolytic anemia lethal congenital nonspherocytic with genital and other abnormalities.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Spinocerebellar ataxia 23?

Symptoms include the following: a large liver, a large spleen, gastrointestinal bleeding caused by varices, increased pressure in the blood vessels that carry blood to the liver (portal hypertension), and scar tissue in the liver (fibrosis). Isolated congenital hepatic fibrosis is rare; it usually occurs as part of a syndrome that also affects the kidneys. There is no treatment to correct the fibrosis or the specific abnormalities in the blood vessels, but complications such as bleeding and infection can be treated.', 'What causes congenital hepatic fibrosis? Isolated congenital hepatic fibrosis is rare. Congenital hepatic fibrosis is usually associated with conditions known as hepatorenal fibrocystic diseases (FCD) that can also affect the kidneys. Examples of FCDs include polycystic kidney disease (PKD) and nephronophthisis (NPHP). FCDs can be inherited as autosomal recessive , autosomal dominant , or X-linked recessive disorders.']}"}, "time": 1746283461.173706}
