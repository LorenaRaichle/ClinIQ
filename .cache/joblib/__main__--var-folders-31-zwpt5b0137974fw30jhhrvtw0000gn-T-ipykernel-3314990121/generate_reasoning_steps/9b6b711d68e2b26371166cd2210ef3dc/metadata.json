There they receive around-the-clock treatment from health care professionals who specialize in treating premature infants.\\n                \\nThe most important treatments for RDS are:\\n                \\nSurfactant replacement therapy.\\n                \\nBreathing support from a ventilator or nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) machine. These machines help premature infants breathe better.\\n                \\nOxygen therapy.\\n                \\nSurfactant Replacement Therapy\\n                \\nSurfactant is a liquid that coats the inside of the lungs. It helps keep them open so that an infant can breathe in air once he or she is born.\\n                \\nBabies who have RDS are given surfactant until their lungs are able to start making the substance on their own. Surfactant usually is given through a breathing tube. The tube allows the surfactant to go directly into the baby's lungs.\\n                \\nOnce the surfactant is given, the breathing tube is connected to a ventilator, or the baby may get breathing support from NCPAP.\\n                \\nSurfactant often is given right after birth in the delivery room to try to prevent or treat RDS. It also may be given several times in the days that follow, until the baby is able to breathe better.\\n                \\nSome women are given medicines called corticosteroids during pregnancy. These medicines can speed up surfactant production and lung development in a fetus. Even if you had these medicines, your infant may still need surfactant replacement therapy after birth.\\n                \\nBreathing Support\\n                \\nInfants who have RDS often need breathing support until their lungs start making enough surfactant. Until recently, a mechanical ventilator usually was used. The ventilator was connected to a breathing tube that ran through the infant's mouth or nose into the windpipe.\\n                \\nToday, more and more infants are receiving breathing support from NCPAP. NCPAP gently pushes air into the baby's lungs through prongs placed in the infant's nostrils.\\n                \\nOxygen Therapy\\n                \\nInfants who have breathing problems may get oxygen therapy. Oxygen is given through a ventilator or NCPAP machine, or through a tube in the nose. This treatment ensures that the infants' organs get enough oxygen to work well.\\n                \\nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Oxygen Therapy article.\\n                \\nOther Treatments\\n                \\nOther treatments for RDS include medicines, supportive therapy, and treatment for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). PDA is a condition that affects some premature infants.\\n                \\nMedicines\\n                \\nDoctors often give antibiotics to infants who have RDS to control infections (if the doctors suspect that an infant has an infection).\\n                \\nSupportive Therapy\\n                \\nTreatment in the NICU helps limit stress on babies and meet their basic needs of warmth, nutrition, and protection. Such treatment may include:\\n                \\nUsing a radiant warmer or incubator to keep infants warm and reduce the risk of infection.\\n                \\nOngoing monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, breathing, and temperature through sensors taped to the babies' bodies.\\n                \\nUsing sensors on fingers or toes to check the amount of oxygen in the infants' blood.\\n                \\nGiving fluids and nutrients through needles or tubes inserted into the infants' veins. This helps prevent malnutrition and promotes growth. Nutrition is critical to the growth and development of the lungs. Later, babies may be given breast milk or infant formula through feeding tubes that are passed through their noses or mouths and into their throats.\\n                \\nChecking fluid intake to make sure that fluid doesn't build up in the babies' lungs.\\n                \\nTreatment for Patent Ductus Arteriosus\\n                \\nPDA is a possible complication of RDS. In this condition, a fetal blood vessel called the ductus arteriosus doesn't close after birth as it should.\\n                \\nThe ductus arteriosus connects a lung artery to a heart artery. If it remains open, it can strain the heart and increase blood pressure in the lung arteries.\\n                \\nPDA is treated with medicines, catheter procedures, and surgery. For more information, go to the Health Topics Patent Ductus Arteriosus article.\", \"Taking steps to ensure a healthy pregnancy might prevent your infant from being born before his or her lungs have fully developed. These steps include:\\n                \\nSeeing your doctor regularly during your pregnancy\\n                \\nFollowing a healthy diet\\n                \\nAvoiding tobacco smoke, alcohol, and illegal drugs\\n                \\nManaging any medical conditions you have\\n                \\nPreventing infections\\n                \\nIf you're having a planned cesarean delivery (C-section), your doctor can do tests before delivery to show whether it's likely that your baby's lungs are fully developed. These tests assess the age of the fetus or lung maturity.\\n                \\nYour doctor may give you injections of a corticosteroid medicine if he or she thinks you may give birth too early. This medicine can speed up surfactant production and development of the lungs, brain, and kidneys in your baby.\\n                \\nTreatment with corticosteroids can reduce your baby's risk of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). If the baby does develop RDS, it will probably be fairly mild.\\n                \\nCorticosteroid treatment also can reduce the chances that your baby will have bleeding in the brain.\", \"Holes in the heart are simple congenital (kon-JEN-ih-tal) heart defects. Congenital heart defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. These defects change the normal flow of blood through the heart.\\n                \\nThe heart has two sides, separated by an inner wall called the septum. With each heartbeat, the right side of the heart receives oxygen-poor blood from the body and pumps it to the lungs. The left side of the heart receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pumps it to the body.\\n                \\nThe septum prevents mixing of blood between the two sides of the heart. However, some babies are born with holes in the upper or lower septum.\\n                \\nA hole in the septum between the heart's two upper chambers is called an atrial septal defect (ASD). A hole in the septum between the heart's two lower chambers is called a ventricular septal defect (VSD).\\n                \\nASDs and VSDs allow blood to pass from the left side of the heart to the right side. Thus, oxygen-rich blood mixes with oxygen-poor blood. As a result, some oxygen-rich blood is pumped to the lungs instead of the body.\\n                \\nOver the past few decades, the diagnosis and treatment of ASDs and VSDs have greatly improved. Children who have simple congenital heart defects can survive to adulthood. They can live normal, active lives because their heart defects close on their own or have been repaired.\", \"Mothers of children who are born with atrial septal defects (ASDs), ventricular septal defects (VSDs), or other heart defects may think they did something wrong during their pregnancies. However, most of the time, doctors don't know why congenital heart defects occur.\\n                \\nHeredity may play a role in some heart defects. For example, a parent who has a congenital heart defect is slightly more likely than other people to have a child who has the problem. Very rarely, more than one child in a family is born with a heart defect.\\n                \\nChildren who have genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome, often have congenital heart defects. Half of all babies who have Down syndrome have congenital heart defects.\\n                \\nSmoking during pregnancy also has been linked to several congenital heart defects, including septal defects.\\n                \\nScientists continue to search for the causes of congenital heart defects.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283465.959845}
