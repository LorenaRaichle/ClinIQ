Accidents, poor training practices, or improper gear can cause them. Some people get hurt because they are not in shape. Not warming up or stretching enough can also lead to injuries.     The most common sports injuries are       - Sprains and strains     -  Knee injuries     -  Swollen muscles     -  Achilles tendon injuries     -  Pain along the shin bone     - Rotator cuff injuries    -  Fractures     -  Dislocations        If you get hurt, stop playing. Continuing to play or exercise can cause more harm. Treatment often begins with the RICE (Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation) method to relieve pain, reduce swelling, and speed healing. Other possible treatments include pain relievers, keeping the injured area from moving, rehabilitation, and sometimes surgery.    NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', \"Parasites are living things that use other living things - like your body - for food and a place to live. You can get them from contaminated food or water, a bug bite, or sexual contact. Some parasitic diseases are easily treated and some are not.    Parasites range in size from tiny, one-celled organisms called protozoa to worms that can be seen with the naked eye. Some parasitic diseases occur in the United States. Contaminated water supplies can lead to Giardia infections. Cats can transmit toxoplasmosis, which is dangerous for pregnant women. Others, like malaria, are common in other parts of the world.     If you are traveling, it's important to drink only water you know is safe. Prevention is especially important. There are no vaccines for parasitic diseases. Some medicines are available to treat parasitic infections.\", \"Summary : You may have heard of anabolic steroids, which can have harmful effects. But there's another type of steroid - sometimes called a corticosteroid - that treats a variety of problems. These steroids are similar to hormones that your adrenal glands make to fight stress associated with illnesses and injuries. They reduce inflammation and affect the immune system.     You may need to take corticosteroids to treat       -  Arthritis    -  Asthma    -  Autoimmune diseases such as lupus and multiple sclerosis    -  Skin conditions such as eczema and rashes    -  Some kinds of cancer       Steroids are strong medicines, and they can have side effects, including weakened bones and cataracts. Because of this, you usually take them for as short a time as possible.\", 'Summary : Normally, if you get hurt, your body forms a blood clot to stop the bleeding. Some people get too many clots or their blood clots abnormally. Many conditions can cause the blood to clot too much or prevent blood clots from dissolving properly.    Risk factors for excessive blood clotting include       - Certain genetic disorders    - Atherosclerosis    - Diabetes    - Atrial fibrillation    - Overweight, obesity, and metabolic syndrome    - Some medicines    - Smoking    Blood clots can form in, or travel to, the blood vessels in the brain, heart, kidneys, lungs, and limbs. A clot in the veins deep in the limbs is called   deep vein thrombosis (DVT). DVT usually affects the deep veins of the legs. If a blood clot in a deep vein breaks off and travels through the bloodstream to the lungs and blocks blood flow, the condition is called   pulmonary embolism. Other complications of blood clots include   stroke,   heart attack, kidney problems and kidney failure, and pregnancy-related problems. Treatments for blood clots include   blood thinners and other medicines.']}"}, "time": 1746283467.0377321}
