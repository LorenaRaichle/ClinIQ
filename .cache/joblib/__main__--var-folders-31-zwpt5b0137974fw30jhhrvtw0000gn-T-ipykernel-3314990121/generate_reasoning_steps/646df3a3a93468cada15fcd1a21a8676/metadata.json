Crohn's disease can thicken the wall of the intestine. Over time, the thickened areas of the intestine can narrow, which can block the intestine. A partial or complete obstruction, also called a bowel blockage, can block the movement of food or stool through the intestines. A complete bowel obstruction is life threatening and requires immediate medical attention and often surgery.  - fistulasabnormal passages, or tunnels, between two organs, or between an organ and the outside of the body. How a health care provider treats fistulas depends on their type and severity. For some people, fistulas heal with medication and diet changes, while other people will need to have surgery.  - anal fissuressmall tears in the anus that may cause itching, pain, or bleeding. Most anal fissures heal with medical treatment, including ointments, warm baths, and dietary changes.  - ulcers. Inflammation anywhere along the GI tract can lead to ulcers or open sores in a person's mouth, intestines, anus, and perineumthe area between the anus and the sex organs. In most cases, the treatment a health care provider prescribes for Crohn's disease will also treat the ulcers.  - malnutritiona condition that develops when the body does not get the right amount of vitamins, minerals, and nutrients it needs to maintain healthy tissues and organ function. Some people may need IV fluids or feeding tubes to replace lost nutrients and fluids.  - inflammation in other areas of the body. The immune system can trigger inflammation in the      - joints    - eyes    - skin\\n                \\nHealth care providers can treat inflammation by adjusting medications or prescribing new medications.\\n                \\n\\n                \\nCrohn's Disease and Colon Cancer   People with Crohn's disease in the large intestine may be more likely to develop colon cancer. People who receive ongoing treatment and remain in remission may reduce their chances of developing colon cancer.   People with Crohn's disease should talk with their health care provider about how often they should get screened for colon cancer. Screening can include colonoscopy with biopsies. Such screening does not reduce a person's chances of developing colon cancer. Instead, screening can help diagnose cancer early and improve chances for recovery.\", \"- Crohn's disease is a chronic, or long lasting, disease that causes inflammationirritation or swellingin the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.  - The exact cause of Crohn's disease is unknown. Researchers believe that factors such as an autoimmune reaction, genes, and environment may play a role in causing Crohn's disease.  - Crohn's disease can occur in people of any age. However, it is more likely to develop in people      - between the ages of 20 and 29    - who have a family member, most often a sibling or parent, with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)    - who smoke cigarettes    - The most common signs and symptoms of Crohn's disease are diarrhea, abdominal cramping and pain, and weight loss.  - A health care provider diagnoses Crohn's disease with the following:      - medical and family history    - physical exam    - lab tests    - upper GI series    - computerized tomography (CT) scan    - intestinal endoscopy    - Which treatment a person needs depends on the severity of the disease and symptoms.  - Good nutrition is important in the management of Crohn's disease. A health care provider may recommend that a person make dietary changes.  - People with Crohn's disease should talk with their health care provider about how often they should get screened for colon cancer.\", 'Whipple disease is a rare bacterial infection that primarily affects the small intestine.

The upper GI tract also includes the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and duodenum, or the first part of the small intestine.\\n                \\nMost food digestion and nutrient absorption take place in the small intestine. The small intestine measures about 20 feet long and includes the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Villitiny, fingerlike protrusionsline the inside of the small intestine. Villi normally let nutrients from food be absorbed through the walls of the small intestine into the bloodstream.']}"}, "time": 1746283485.2272398}
