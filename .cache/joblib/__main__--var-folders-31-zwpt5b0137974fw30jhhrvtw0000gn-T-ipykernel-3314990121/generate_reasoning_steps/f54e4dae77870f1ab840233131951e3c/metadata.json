T. whipplei infection can cause internal sores, also called lesions, and thickening of tissues in the small intestine. The villi take on an abnormal, clublike appearance and the damaged intestinal lining does not properly absorb nutrients, causing diarrhea and malnutrition. Diarrhea is frequent, loose, and watery bowel movements. Malnutrition is a condition that develops when the body does not get the right amount of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients it needs to maintain healthy tissues and organ function. Over time, the infection spreads to other parts of the persons body and will damage other organs.', 'Signs and symptoms of Whipple disease can vary widely from person to person. The most common symptoms of Whipple disease are\\n                \\n- diarrhea  - weight loss caused by malabsorption\\n                \\nA person may not have diarrhea. Instead, other signs and symptoms of Whipple disease may appear, such as\\n                \\n- abnormal yellow and white patches on the lining of the small intestine  - joint pain, with or without inflammation, that may appear off and on for years before other symptoms  - fatty or bloody stools  - abdominal cramps or bloating felt between the chest and groin  - enlarged lymph nodesthe small glands that make infection-fighting white blood cells  - loss of appetite  - fever  - fatigue, or feeling tired  - weakness  - darkening of the skin\\n                \\nPeople with a more advanced stage of Whipple disease may have neurologic symptomsthose related to the central nervous systemsuch as\\n                \\n- vision problems.  - memory problems or personality changes.  - facial numbness.  - headaches.  - muscle weakness or twitching.  - difficulty walking.  - hearing loss or ringing in the ears.  - dementiathe name for a group of symptoms caused by disorders that affect the brain. People with dementia may not be able to think well enough to do normal activities such as getting dressed or eating.\\n                \\nLess common symptoms of Whipple disease may include\\n                \\n- chronic cough.  - chest pain.  - pericarditisinflammation of the membrane surrounding the heart.  - heart failurea long-lasting condition in which the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the bodys needs. Heart failure does not mean the heart suddenly stops working.', 'People with Whipple disease may have complications caused by malnutrition, which is due to damaged villi in the small intestine. As a result of delayed diagnosis or treatment, people may experience the following complications in other areas of the body:\\n                \\n- long-lasting nutritional deficiencies  - heart and heart valve damage  - brain damage\\n                \\nA person with Whipple disease may experience a relapsea return of symptoms. Relapse can happen years after treatment and requires repeat treatments.', 'A health care provider may use several tests and exams to diagnose Whipple disease, including the following:\\n                \\n- medical and family history  - physical exam  - blood tests  - upper GI endoscopy and enteroscopy\\n                \\nA patient may be referred to a gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseases.\\n                \\nA health care provider may first try to rule out more common conditions with similar symptoms, including\\n                \\n- inflammatory rheumatic diseasecharacterized by inflammation and loss of function in one or more connecting or supporting structures of the body.  - celiac diseasea digestive disease that damages the small intestine and interferes with the absorption of nutrients from food. People who have celiac disease cannot tolerate gluten, a protein in wheat, rye, and barley.  - neurologic diseasesdisorders of the central nervous system.  - intra-abdominal lymphomaabdominal cancer in part of the immune system called the lymphatic system.  - Mycobacterium avium complexan infection that affects people with AIDS.\\n                \\nMedical and Family History\\n                \\nTaking a family and medical history can help a health care provider diagnose Whipple disease.\\n                \\nPhysical Exam\\n                \\nA physical exam may help diagnose Whipple disease. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually\\n                \\n- examines a patients body  - uses a stethoscope to listen to sounds related to the abdomen  - taps on specific areas of the patients body checking for pain or tenderness\\n                \\nBlood Tests\\n                \\nA technician or nurse draws a blood sample during an office visit or at a commercial facility and sends the sample to a lab for analysis. The health care provider may use blood tests to check for\\n                \\n- malabsorption. When the damaged villi do not absorb certain nutrients from food, the body has a shortage of protein, calories, and vitamins. Blood tests can show shortages of protein, calories, and vitamins in the body.  - abnormal levels of electrolytes. Electrolyteschemicals in body fluids, including sodium, potassium, magnesium, and chlorideregulate a persons nerve and muscle function. A patient who has malabsorption or a lot of diarrhea may lose fluids and electrolytes, causing an imbalance in the body.  - anemia. Anemia is a condition in which the body has fewer red blood cells than normal. A patient with Whipple disease does not absorb the proper nutrients to make enough red blood cells in the body, leading to anemia.  - T. whipplei DNA. Although not yet approved, rapid polymerase chain reaction diagnostic tests have been developed to detect T. whipplei DNA and may be useful in diagnosis.\\n                \\nUpper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and Enteroscopy\\n                \\nAn upper GI endoscopy and enteroscopy are procedures that use an endoscopea small, flexible tube with a lightto see the upper GI tract. A health care provider performs these tests at a hospital or an outpatient center. The health care provider carefully feeds the endoscope down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum.\\n                \\nOnce the endoscope is in the duodenum, the health care provider will use smaller tools and a smaller scope to see more of the small intestine. These additional procedures may include\\n                \\n- push enteroscopy, which uses a long endoscope to examine the upper portion of the small intestine.  - double-balloon enteroscopy, which uses balloons to help move the endoscope through the entire small intestine.  - capsule enteroscopy, during which the patient swallows a capsule containing a tiny camera. As the capsule passes through the GI tract, the camera will transmit images to a video monitor. Using this procedure, the health care provider can examine the entire digestive tract.\\n                \\nA small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. A health care provider may give a patient a liquid anesthetic to gargle or may spray anesthetic on the back of the patients throat. A health care provider will place an intravenous (IV) needle in a vein in the arm or hand to administer sedation. Sedatives help patients stay relaxed and comfortable. The test can show changes in the lining of the small intestine that can occur with Whipple disease.\\n                \\nThe health care provider can use tiny tools passed through the endoscope to perform biopsies. A biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of tissue for examination with a microscope. A pathologista doctor who specializes in examining tissues to diagnose diseasesexamines the tissue from the stomach lining in a lab. The pathologist applies a special stain to the tissue and examines it for T. whipplei-infected cells with a microscope. Once the pathologist completes the examination of the tissue, he or she sends a report to the gastroenterologist for review.
