Many rashes are itchy, red, painful, and irritated. Some rashes can also lead to blisters or patches of raw skin. Rashes are a symptom of many different medical problems. Other causes include irritating substances and allergies. Certain genes can make people more likely to get rashes.    Contact dermatitis is a common type of rash. It causes redness, itching, and sometimes small bumps. You get the rash where you have touched an irritant, such as a chemical, or something you are allergic to, like poison ivy.    Some rashes develop right away. Others form over several days. Although most rashes clear up fairly quickly, others are long-lasting and need long-term treatment.    Because rashes can be caused by many different things, it's important to figure out what kind you have before you treat it. If it is a bad rash, if it does not go away, or if you have other symptoms, you should see your health care provider. Treatments may include moisturizers, lotions, baths, cortisone creams that relieve swelling, and antihistamines, which relieve itching.\", 'While childbirth usually goes well, complications can happen. They can cause a risk to the mother, baby, or both. Possible complications include       - Preterm (premature) labor, when labor starts before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy    - Problems with the umbilical cord    - Problems with the position of the baby, such as breech, in which the baby is going to come out feet first    - Birth injuries       For some of these problems, the baby may need to be delivered surgically by a Cesarean section.', \"Summary : Chiropractic is a health care profession. Chiropractors perform adjustments (manipulations) to the spine or other parts of the body. The goal is to correct alignment problems, ease pain, and support the body's natural ability to heal itself. They may also use other treatments including        - Heat and ice    - Electrical stimulation    - Relaxation techniques    - Rehabilitative and general exercise    - Counseling about diet, weight loss, and other lifestyle factors    - Dietary supplements       Many people visit chiropractors for treatment of low back pain, neck pain, and headaches.

This includes completed or attempted sex acts that are against your will. Sometimes it can involve a victim who is unable to consent. It also includes abusive sexual contact. It can happen to men, women or children.    The attacker can be anyone - a current or former partner, a family member, a person in position of power or trust, a friend, an acquaintance, or a stranger.    Sexual assault can affect your health in many ways. It can lead to long-term health and emotional problems. It is important to seek help if you have been assaulted. First, get to a safe place. Then dial 9-1-1 or go to a hospital for medical care. You may want to have counseling to deal with your feelings. The most important thing to know is that the assault was not your fault.
