Genes pass information from both parents to the child and determine the childs traits. Sometimes, parents may pass a gene that has changed, or mutated, causing kidney dysplasia.\\n                \\nGenetic syndromes that affect multiple body systems can also cause kidney dysplasia. A syndrome is a group of symptoms or conditions that may seem unrelated yet are thought to have the same genetic cause. A baby with kidney dysplasia due to a genetic syndrome might also have problems of the digestive tract, nervous system, heart and blood vessels, muscles and skeleton, or other parts of the urinary tract.\\n                \\nA baby may also develop kidney dysplasia if his or her mother takes certain prescription medications during pregnancy, such as some used to treat seizures and high blood pressure. A mothers use of illegal drugs, such as cocaine, during pregnancy may also cause kidney dysplasia in her unborn child.', 'Kidney dysplasia is a common condition. Scientists estimate that kidney dysplasia affects about one in 4,000 babies.1 This estimate may be low because some people with kidney dysplasia are never diagnosed with the condition. About half of the babies diagnosed with this condition have other urinary tract defects.2', 'Many babies with kidney dysplasia in only one kidney have no signs of the condition. In some cases, the affected kidney may be enlarged at birth and may cause pain.', 'The complications of kidney dysplasia can include\\n                \\n- hydronephrosis of the working kidney. A baby with kidney dysplasia in only one kidney might have other urinary tract defects. When other defects in the urinary tract block the flow of urine, the urine backs up and causes the kidneys and ureters to swell, a condition called hydronephrosis. If left untreated, hydronephrosis can damage the working kidney and reduce its ability to filter blood. Kidney damage may lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and kidney failure.  - a urinary tract infection (UTI). A urine blockage may increase a babys chance of developing a UTI. Recurring UTIs can also lead to kidney damage.  - high blood pressure.  - a slightly increased chance of developing kidney cancer.\\n                \\nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topics, urine blockage in newbornsand UTIs in children.']}"}, "time": 1746283485.3179111}
