The TAZ gene provides instructions for making a protein called tafazzin. Tafazzin is located in structures called mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers of cells. Tafazzin is involved in altering a fat (lipid) called cardiolipin, which plays critical roles in the mitochondrial inner membrane. Once altered by tafazzin, cardiolipin is key in maintaining mitochondrial shape, energy production, and protein transport within cells.  TAZ gene mutations result in the production of tafazzin proteins with little or no function. As a result, tafazzin cannot alter cardiolipin. A lack of functional cardiolipin impairs normal mitochondrial shape and functions. Tissues with high energy demands, such as the heart and skeletal muscles, are most susceptible to cell death due to reduced energy production in mitochondria. Additionally, abnormally shaped mitochondria are found in affected white blood cells, which could affect their ability to grow (proliferate) and mature (differentiate), leading to neutropenia. Dysfunctional mitochondria likely lead to other signs and symptoms of Barth syndrome.', 'This condition is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. The gene associated with this condition is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.', \"These resources address the diagnosis or management of Barth syndrome:  - Cleveland Clinic: Dilated Cardiomyopathy  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Barth Syndrome  - Genetic Testing Registry: 3-Methylglutaconic aciduria type 2  - Johns Hopkins Children's Center: Neutrophil Disorders  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Neutropenia--Infants   These resources from MedlinePlus offer information about the diagnosis and management of various health conditions:  - Diagnostic Tests  - Drug Therapy  - Surgery and Rehabilitation  - Genetic Counseling   - Palliative Care\", 'Brody myopathy is a condition that affects the skeletal muscles, which are the muscles used for movement. Affected individuals experience muscle cramping and stiffening after exercise or other strenuous activity, especially in cold temperatures. These symptoms typically begin in childhood. They are usually painless, but in some cases can cause mild discomfort. The muscles usually relax after a few minutes of rest. Most commonly affected are the muscles of the arms, legs, and face (particularly the eyelids).  In some people with Brody myopathy, exercise leads to the breakdown of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis). The destruction of muscle tissue releases a protein called myoglobin, which is processed by the kidneys and released in the urine (myoglobinuria). Myoglobin causes the urine to be red or brown.']}"}, "time": 1746283449.809751}
