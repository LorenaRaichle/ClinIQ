The condition occurs if your immune system attacks your blood vessels by mistake. This may happen as the result of an infection, a medicine, or another disease or condition.\\n                \\nInflammation refers to the bodys response to injury, including injury to the blood vessels. Inflammation may involve pain, redness, warmth, swelling, and loss of function in the affected tissues.\\n                \\nIn vasculitis, inflammation can lead to serious problems. Complications depend on which blood vessels, organs, or other body systems are affected.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nVasculitis can affect any of the body\\'s blood vessels. These include arteries, veins, and capillaries. Arteries carry blood from your heart to your body\\'s organs. Veins carry blood from your organs and limbs back to your heart. Capillaries connect the small arteries and veins.\\n                \\nIf a blood vessel is inflamed, it can narrow or close off. This limits or prevents blood flow through the vessel. Rarely, the blood vessel will stretch and weaken, causing it to bulge. This bulge is known as an aneurysm (AN-u-rism).\\n                \\nVasculitis\\n                \\n\\n                \\nThe disruption in blood flow caused by inflammation can damage the body\\'s organs. Signs and symptoms depend on which organs have been damaged and the extent of the damage.\\n                \\nTypical symptoms of inflammation, such as fever and general aches and pains, are common among people who have vasculitis.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nThere are many types of vasculitis, but overall the condition is rare. If you have vasculitis, the outlook depends on:\\n                \\nThe type of vasculitis you have\\n                \\nWhich organs are affected\\n                \\nHow quickly the condition worsens\\n                \\nThe severity of the condition\\n                \\nTreatment often works well if its started early. In some cases, vasculitis may go into remission. \"Remission\" means the condition isn\\'t active, but it can come back, or \"flare,\" at any time.\\n                \\nSometimes vasculitis is chronic (ongoing) and never goes into remission. Long-term treatment with medicines often can control the signs and symptoms of chronic vasculitis.\\n                \\nRarely, vasculitis doesn\\'t respond well to treatment. This can lead to disability and even death.\\n                \\nMuch is still unknown about vasculitis. However, researchers continue to learn more about the condition and its various types, causes, and treatments.', \"Vasculitis occurs if your immune system attacks your blood vessels by mistake. What causes this to happen isn't fully known.\\n                \\nA recent or chronic (ongoing) infection may prompt the attack. Your body also may attack its own blood vessels in reaction to a medicine.\\n                \\nSometimes an autoimmune disorder triggers vasculitis. Autoimmune disorders occur if the immune system makes antibodies (proteins) that attack and damage the body's own tissues or cells. Examples of these disorders include lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and scleroderma. You can have these disorders for years before developing vasculitis.\\n                \\nVasculitis also may be linked to certain blood cancers, such as leukemia and lymphoma.\", 'Vasculitis can affect people of all ages and races and both sexes. Some types of vasculitis seem to occur more often in people who:\\n                \\nHave certain medical conditions, such as chronic hepatitis B or C infection\\n                \\nHave certain autoimmune diseases, such a lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and scleroderma\\n                \\nSmoke\\n                \\nFor more information, go to \"Types of Vasculitis.\"', 'The signs and symptoms of vasculitis vary. They depend on the type of vasculitis you have, the organs involved, and the severity of the condition. Some people may have few signs and symptoms. Other people may become very sick.\\n                \\nSometimes the signs and symptoms develop slowly, over months. Other times, the signs and symptoms develop quickly, over days or weeks.\\n                \\nSystemic Signs and Symptoms\\n                \\nSystemic signs and symptoms are those that affect you in a general or overall way. Common systemic signs and symptoms of vasculitis are:\\n                \\nFever\\n                \\nLoss of appetite\\n                \\nWeight loss\\n                \\nFatigue (tiredness)\\n                \\nGeneral aches and pains\\n                \\nOrgan- or Body System-Specific Signs and Symptoms\\n                \\nVasculitis can affect specific organs and body systems, causing a range of signs and symptoms.\\n                \\nSkin\\n                \\nIf vasculitis affects your skin, you may notice skin changes. For example, you may have purple or red spots or bumps, clusters of small dots, splotches, bruises, or hives. Your skin also may itch.\\n                \\nJoints\\n                \\nIf vasculitis affects your joints, you may ache or develop arthritis in one or more joints.\\n                \\nLungs\\n                \\nIf vasculitis affects your lungs, you may feel short of breath. You may even cough up blood. The results from a chest x ray may show signs that suggest pneumonia, even though that may not be what you have.\\n                \\nGastrointestinal Tract\\n                \\nIf vasculitis affects your gastrointestinal tract, you may get ulcers (sores) in your mouth or have stomach pain.\\n                \\nIn severe cases, blood flow to the intestines can be blocked. This can cause the wall of the intestines to weaken and possibly rupture (burst). A rupture can lead to serious problems or even death.\\n                \\nSinuses, Nose, Throat, and Ears\\n                \\nIf vasculitis affects your sinuses, nose, throat, and ears, you may have sinus or chronic (ongoing) middle ear infections. Other symptoms include ulcers in the nose and, in some cases, hearing loss.\\n                \\nEyes\\n                \\nIf vasculitis affects your eyes, you may develop red, itchy, burning eyes. Your eyes also may become sensitive to light, and your vision may blur. Rarely, certain types of vasculitis may cause blindness.\\n                \\nBrain\\n                \\nIf vasculitis affects your brain, symptoms may include headaches, problems thinking clearly, changes in mental function, or stroke-like symptoms, such as muscle weakness and paralysis (an inability to move).\\n                \\nNerves\\n                \\nIf vasculitis affects your nerves, you may have numbness, tingling, and weakness in various parts of your body.
