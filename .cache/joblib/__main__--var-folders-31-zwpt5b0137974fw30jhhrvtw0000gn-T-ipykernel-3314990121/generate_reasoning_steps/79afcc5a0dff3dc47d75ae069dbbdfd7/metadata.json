Alzheimers disease is the most common cause of dementia among older people. Dementia ranges in severity from the mild stage, when it is just beginning to affect a persons functioning, to the severe stage, when the person must depend completely on others for care.', 'Mild cognitive impairment, or MCI, is a condition that can be an early sign of Alzheimers diseasebut not everyone with MCI will develop Alzheimers. People with MCI can still take care of themselves and do their normal activities. Signs of MCI may include - losing things often  - forgetting to go to events and appointments  - having more trouble coming up with words than other people the same age. losing things often forgetting to go to events and appointments having more trouble coming up with words than other people the same age.', 'Memory problems are typically one of the first signs of Alzheimers disease, though different people may have different initial symptoms. A decline in other aspects of thinking, such as finding the right words, vision/spatial issues, and impaired reasoning or judgment, may also signal the very early stages of Alzheimers disease.', \"Alzheimer's disease has three stages: early (also called mild), middle (moderate), and late (severe). A person in the early stage of Alzheimers may - find it hard to remember things  -  ask the same questions over and over  -  get lost in familiar places  -  lose things or put them in odd places  - have trouble handling money and paying bills  - take longer than normal to finish daily tasks. find it hard to remember things ask the same questions over and over get lost in familiar places lose things or put them in odd places have trouble handling money and paying bills take longer than normal to finish daily tasks. As Alzheimers disease progresses to the middle stage, memory loss and confusion grow worse, and people may have problems recognizing family and friends. Other symptoms are this stage include -  difficulty learning new things and coping with new situations  - trouble carrying out tasks that involve multiple steps, like getting dressed  -  impulsive behavior  - forgetting the names of common things  - hallucinations, delusions, or paranoia  - wandering away from home. difficulty learning new things and coping with new situations trouble carrying out tasks that involve multiple steps, like getting dressed impulsive behavior forgetting the names of common things hallucinations, delusions, or paranoia wandering away from home. As Alzheimers disease becomes more severe, people lose the ability to communicate. They may sleep more, lose weight, and have trouble swallowing. Often they are incontinentthey cannot control their bladder and/or bowels. Eventually, they need total care.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283468.081423}
