Your gallbladder stores it between meals. When you eat, your gallbladder pushes the bile into tubes called bile ducts. They carry the bile to your small intestine. The bile helps break down fat. It also helps the liver get rid of toxins and wastes.    Different diseases can block the bile ducts and cause a problem with the flow of bile:       - Gallstones, which can increase pressure in the gallbladder and cause a gallbladder attack. The pain usually lasts from one to several hours.    - Cancer    - Infections    - Birth defects, such as biliary atresia. It is the most common reason for liver transplants in children in the United States.    - Inflammation, which can cause scarring. Over time, this can lead to liver failure.       NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', \"Many children wet the bed until they are 5 or even older. A child's bladder might be too small. Or the amount of urine produced overnight can be more than the bladder can hold. Some children sleep too deeply or take longer to learn bladder control. Stress can also be a factor. Children should not be punished for wetting the bed. They don't do it on purpose, and most outgrow it.    Call the doctor if your child is 7 years old or older and wets the bed more than two or three times in a week. The doctor will look for and treat any other heath problems that could cause the bedwetting. Bedwetting alarms, bladder training, and medicines might help with the bedwetting.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\", 'If you have diabetes, your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Over time, this can damage the covering on your nerves or the blood vessels that bring oxygen to your nerves. Damaged nerves may stop sending messages, or may send messages slowly or at the wrong times.     This damage is called diabetic neuropathy. Over half of people with diabetes get it. Symptoms may include       - Numbness in your hands, legs, or feet    - Shooting pains, burning, or tingling    - Nausea, vomiting, constipation, or diarrhea    - Problems with sexual function    - Urinary problems    - Dizziness when you change positions quickly       Your doctor will diagnose diabetic neuropathy with a physical exam and nerve tests. Controlling your blood sugar can help prevent nerve problems, or keep them from getting worse. Treatment may include pain relief and other medicines.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Summary : Computed tomography (CT) is a type of imaging. It uses special x-ray equipment to make cross-sectional pictures of your body.     Doctors use CT scans to look for       -  Broken bones    -  Cancers    -  Blood clots    -  Signs of heart disease    -  Internal bleeding       During a CT scan, you lie still on a table. The table slowly passes through the center of a large X-ray machine. The test is painless. During some tests you receive a contrast dye, which makes parts of your body show up better in the image.
