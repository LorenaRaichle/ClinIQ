The underlying cause of tracheobronchopathia osteoplastica (TO) remains unknown. Several theories have been proposed, including chronic airway inflammation, exostosis (formation of new bone), and metaplasia (abnormal cell changes) in the affected tissue. Numerous cases have been reported in association with different conditions including allergic rhinitis. However, no theories have been validated. There is no known genetic susceptibility to the development of TO.', 'Is tracheobronchopathia osteoplastica inherited? There is no known genetic susceptibility to the development of TO, and it typically occurs in people with no known history of the condition in their family. Familial occurrence has been reported only once, in a woman and her daughter.', 'How is tracheobronchopathia osteoplastica diagnosed? Fiberoptic bronchoscopy is thought to be the best procedure to diagnose tracheobronchopathia osteoplastica (TO). This procedure is done when it is important to see the airways or to get samples of mucus or tissue from the lungs. It involves placing a thin, tube-like instrument through the nose or mouth and down into the lungs. During this procedure a bronchial biopsy is usually performed, but samples are sometimes hard to obtain. TO is usually an incidental finding during fiberoptic bronchoscopy, and is rarely suspected before the procedure is done.', 'How might tracheobronchopathia osteoplastica be treated? There is no specific treatment for tracheobronchopathia osteoplastica (TO). Recurrent infections and collapse of the lung are treated conventionally. Inhaled corticosteroids may have some impact on people in early stages of the condition, but whether they may be helpful for people with more advanced disease needs further study. Occasionally, tracheostomy may be needed. Surgical treatment options may be considered when all conservative therapies have been unsuccessful. The long-term outlook (prognosis) for affected people is generally good, but usually depends on the extension and location of the lesions. It has been reported that over 55% of affected people do not have any disease progression following the diagnosis.']}"}, "time": 1746283459.062359}
