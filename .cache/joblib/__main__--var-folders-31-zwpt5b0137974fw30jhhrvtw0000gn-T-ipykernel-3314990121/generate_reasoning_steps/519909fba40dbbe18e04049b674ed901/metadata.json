Unfortunately, there is no cure for pseudoxanthoma elasticum.  Affected individuals are recommended to have regular physical examinations with their primary care physician and routine eye examinations with an eye doctor (ophthalmologist) who is familiar with retinal disorders.  A team of doctors in other specialties - including dermatology, cardiology, plastic surgery, vascular surgery, genetics, and nutrition - may also help with the management this condition.  Individuals should be alert to changes in their vision and should inform their eye doctor of any such changes.  Several therapies may be effective for slowing the reduction in vision in PXE.  Surgery may help to reduce skin symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, or severe vascular symptoms in the legs.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Leber congenital amaurosis 16? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Leber congenital amaurosis 16. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Strabismus 5% Autosomal recessive inheritance - Cataract - Nyctalopia - Nystagmus - Reduced visual acuity - Visual impairment - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Accessory deep peroneal nerve?

The condition may be classified into three major types based on the general age that signs and symptoms first appear: classic infantile (type 1); juvenile (type 2); and adult onset or chronic (type 3). Although the types differ in severity, their features may overlap significantly. GM1 gangliosidosis is caused by mutations in the GLB1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is currently symptomatic and supportive.']}"}, "time": 1746283461.6868742}
