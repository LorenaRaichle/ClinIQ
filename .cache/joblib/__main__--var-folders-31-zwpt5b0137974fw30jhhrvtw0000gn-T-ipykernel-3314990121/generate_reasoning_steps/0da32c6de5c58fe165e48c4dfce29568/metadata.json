The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the deletion and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with distal chromosome 18q deletion syndrome include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems and distinctive facial features. Chromosome testing of both parents can provide more information on whether or not the deletion was inherited. In most cases, parents do not have any chromosomal anomaly. However, sometimes one parent is found to have a balanced translocation, where a piece of a chromosome has broken off and attached to another one with no gain or loss of genetic material. The balanced translocation normally does not cause any signs or symptoms, but it increases the risk for having an affected child with a chromosomal anomaly like a deletion. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. This page is meant to provide general information about distal 18q deletions. You can contact GARD if you have questions about a specific deletion on chromosome 18. To learn more about chromosomal anomalies please visit our GARD webpage on FAQs about Chromosome Disorders.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Distal chromosome 18q deletion syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Distal chromosome 18q deletion syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Absence of the pulmonary valve - Aortic valve stenosis - Asthma - Atopic dermatitis - Atresia of the external auditory canal - Atria septal defect - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Bifid uvula - Blepharophimosis - Broad-based gait - Cerebellar hypoplasia - Choanal stenosis - Chorea - Cleft palate - Cleft upper lip - Conductive hearing impairment - Congestive heart failure - Cryptorchidism - Delayed CNS myelination - Depressed nasal bridge - Dilatation of the ascending aorta - Downturned corners of mouth - Dysplastic aortic valve - Dysplastic pulmonary valve - Epicanthus - Failure to thrive in infancy - Flat midface - Growth hormone deficiency - Hypertelorism - Hypoplasia of midface - Hypospadias - Inguinal hernia - Intellectual disability - Joint laxity - Low anterior hairline - Macrotia - Malar flattening - Mandibular prognathia - Microcephaly - Micropenis - Motor delay - Muscular hypotonia - Nystagmus - Optic atrophy - Overlapping toe - Patent ductus arteriosus - Pes cavus - Pes planus - Phenotypic variability - Poor coordination - Prominent nose - Proximal placement of thumb - Recurrent respiratory infections - Rocker bottom foot - Scoliosis - Secretory IgA deficiency - Seizures - Sensorineural hearing impairment - Short neck - Short palpebral fissure - Short philtrum - Short stature - Sporadic - Stenosis of the external auditory canal - Strabismus - Talipes equinovarus - Tapetoretinal degeneration - Toe syndactyly - Tremor - Umbilical hernia - U-Shaped upper lip vermilion - Ventricular septal defect - Ventriculomegaly - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Tourette syndrome is a complex neurological disorder that is characterized by repetitive, sudden, uncontrolled (involuntary) movements and sounds (vocalizations) called tics. Tourette syndrome is named for Georges Gilles de la Tourette, who first described this disorder in 1885. A variety of genetic and environmental factors likely play a role in causing Tourette syndrome. A small number of people with Tourette syndrome have been found to have mutations involving the SLITRK1 gene. The syndrome is believed to be linked to problems in certain areas of the brain, and the chemical substances (dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine) that help nerve cells talk to one another. It is estimated that about 1% of the population has Tourette syndrome. Many people with very mild tics may not be aware of them and never seek medical help. Tourette syndrome is four times as likely to occur in boys as in girls. Although Tourette syndrome can be a chronic condition with symptoms lasting a lifetime, most people with the condition experience their worst symptoms in their early teens, with improvement occurring in the late teens and continuing into adulthood.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Tourette syndrome? The early symptoms of Tourette syndrome are almost always noticed first in childhood, with the average onset between the ages of 3 and 9 years. Although the symptoms of Tourette syndrome vary from person to person and range from very mild to severe, the majority of cases fall into the mild category. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Tourette syndrome.
