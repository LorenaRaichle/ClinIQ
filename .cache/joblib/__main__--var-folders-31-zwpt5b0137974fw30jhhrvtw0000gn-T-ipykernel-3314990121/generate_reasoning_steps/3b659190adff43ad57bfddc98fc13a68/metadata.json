The goal of treatment is to close the PDA. Closure will help prevent complications and reverse the effects of increased blood volume.\\n                \\nSmall PDAs often close without treatment. For full-term infants, treatment is needed if the PDA is large or causing health problems. For premature infants, treatment is needed if the PDA is causing breathing problems or heart problems.\\n                \\nTalk with your child\\'s doctor about treatment options and how your family prefers to handle treatment decisions.\\n                \\nMedicines\\n                \\nYour child\\'s doctor may prescribe medicines to help close your child\\'s PDA.\\n                \\nIndomethacin (in-doh-METH-ah-sin) is a medicine that helps close PDAs in premature infants. This medicine triggers the PDA to constrict or tighten, which closes the opening. Indomethacin usually doesn\\'t work in full-term infants.\\n                \\nIbuprofen also is used to close PDAs in premature infants. This medicine is similar to indomethacin.\\n                \\nCatheter-Based Procedures\\n                \\nCatheters are thin, flexible tubes that doctors use as part of a procedure called cardiac catheterization (KATH-eh-ter-ih-ZA-shun). Catheter-based procedures often are used to close PDAs in infants or children who are large enough to have the procedure.\\n                \\nYour child\\'s doctor may refer to the procedure as \"transcatheter device closure.\" The procedure sometimes is used for small PDAs to prevent the risk of infective endocarditis (IE). IE is an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves.\\n                \\nYour child will be given medicine to help him or her relax or sleep during the procedure. The doctor will insert a catheter in a large blood vessel in the groin (upper thigh). He or she will then guide the catheter to your child\\'s heart.\\n                \\nA small metal coil or other blocking device is passed through the catheter and placed in the PDA. This device blocks blood flow through the vessel.\\n                \\nCatheter-based procedures don\\'t require the child\\'s chest to be opened. They also allow the child to recover quickly.\\n                \\nThese procedures often are done on an outpatient basis. You\\'ll most likely be able to take your child home the same day the procedure is done.\\n                \\nComplications from catheter-based procedures are rare and short term. They can include bleeding, infection, and movement of the blocking device from where it was placed.\\n                \\nSurgery\\n                \\nSurgery to correct a PDA may be done if:\\n                \\nA premature or full-term infant has health problems due to a PDA and is too small to have a catheter-based procedure\\n                \\nA catheter-based procedure doesn\\'t successfully close the PDA\\n                \\nSurgery is planned for treatment of related congenital heart defects\\n                \\nOften, surgery isn\\'t done until after 6 months of age in infants who don\\'t have health problems from their PDAs. Doctors sometimes do surgery on small PDAs to prevent the risk of IE.\\n                \\nFor the surgery, your child will be given medicine so that he or she will sleep and not feel any pain. The surgeon will make a small incision (cut) between your child\\'s ribs to reach the PDA. He or she will close the PDA using stitches or clips.\\n                \\nComplications from surgery are rare and usually short term. They can include hoarseness, a paralyzed diaphragm (the muscle below the lungs), infection, bleeding, or fluid buildup around the lungs.\\n                \\nAfter Surgery\\n                \\nAfter surgery, your child will spend a few days in the hospital. He or she will be given medicine to reduce pain and anxiety. Most children go home 2 days after surgery. Premature infants usually have to stay in the hospital longer because of their other health issues.\\n                \\nThe doctors and nurses at the hospital will teach you how to care for your child at home. They will talk to you about:\\n                \\nLimits on activity for your child while he or she recovers\\n                \\nFollowup appointments with your child\\'s doctors\\n                \\nHow to give your child medicines at home, if needed\\n                \\nWhen your child goes home after surgery, you can expect that he or she will feel fairly comfortable. However, you child may have some short-term pain.\\n                \\nYour child should begin to eat better and gain weight quickly. Within a few weeks, he or she should fully recover and be able to take part in normal activities.\\n                \\nLong-term complications from surgery are rare. However, they can include narrowing of the aorta, incomplete closure of the PDA, and reopening of the PDA.', \"Hemochromatosis (HE-mo-kro-ma-TO-sis) is a disease in which too much iron builds up in your body (iron overload). Iron is a mineral found in many foods.\\n                \\nToo much iron is toxic to your body. It can poison your organs and cause organ failure. In hemochromatosis, iron can build up in most of your body's organs, but especially in the liver, heart, and pancreas.\\n                \\nToo much iron in the liver can cause an enlarged liver, liver failure, liver cancer, or cirrhosis (sir-RO-sis). Cirrhosis is scarring of the liver, which causes the organ to not work well.\\n                \\nToo much iron in the heart can cause irregular heartbeats called arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs) and heart failure. Too much iron in the pancreas can lead to diabetes.\\n                \\nIf hemochromatosis isn't treated, it may even cause death.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nThe two types of hemochromatosis are primary and secondary. Primary hemochromatosis is caused by a defect in the genes that control how much iron you absorb from food. Secondary hemochromatosis usually is the result of another disease or condition that causes iron overload.\\n                \\nMost people who have primary hemochromatosis inherit it from their parents. If you inherit two hemochromatosis genesone from each parentyou're at risk for iron overload and signs and symptoms of the disease. The two faulty genes cause your body to absorb more iron than usual from the foods you eat.\\n                \\nHemochromatosis is one of the most common genetic disorders in the United States. However, not everyone who has hemochromatosis has signs or symptoms of the disease.\\n                \\nEstimates of how many people develop signs and symptoms vary greatly. Some estimates suggest that as many as half of all people who have the disease don't have signs or symptoms.\\n                \\nThe severity of hemochromatosis also varies. Some people don't have complications, even with high levels of iron in their bodies. Others have severe complications or die from the disease.\\n                \\nCertain factors can affect the severity of the disease. For example, a high intake of vitamin C can make hemochromatosis worse. This is because vitamin C helps your body absorb iron from food.\\n                \\nAlcohol use can worsen liver damage and cirrhosis caused by hemochromatosis. Conditions such as hepatitis also can further damage or weaken the liver.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nThe outlook for people who have hemochromatosis largely depends on how much organ damage they have at the time of diagnosis. Early diagnosis and treatment of the disease are important.\\n                \\nTreatment may help prevent, delay, or sometimes reverse complications of the disease. Treatment also may lead to better quality of life.\\n                \\nFor people who are diagnosed and treated early, a normal lifespan is possible. If left untreated, hemochromatosis can lead to severe organ damage and even death.\", 'The two types of hemochromatosis are primary and secondary. Each type has a different cause.\\n                \\nPrimary Hemochromatosis\\n                \\nPrimary hemochromatosis is caused by a defect in the genes that control how much iron you absorb from food. This form of the disease sometimes is called hereditary or classical hemochromatosis. Primary hemochromatosis is more common than the secondary form of the disease.\\n                \\nThe genes usually involved in primary hemochromatosis are called HFE genes. Faulty HFE genes cause the body to absorb too much iron. If you inherit two copies of the faulty HFE gene (one from each parent), you\\'re at risk for iron overload and signs and symptoms of hemochromatosis.\\n                \\nIf you inherit one faulty HFE gene and one normal HFE gene, you\\'re a hemochromatosis \"carrier.\" Carriers usually don\\'t develop the disease. However, they can pass the faulty gene on to their children. Estimates suggest that about 1 in 10 people in the United States are hemochromatosis carriers.\\n                \\nIf two parents are carriers of the faulty HFE gene, then each of their children has a 1 in 4 chance of inheriting two faulty HFE genes.\\n                \\nAlthough less common, other faulty genes also can cause hemochromatosis. Researchers continue to study what changes to normal genes may cause the disease.\\n                \\nSecondary Hemochromatosis\\n                \\nSecondary hemochromatosis usually is the result of another disease or condition that causes iron overload. Examples of such diseases and conditions include:\\n                \\nCertain types of anemia, such as thalassemias and sideroblastic anemia\\n                \\nAtransferrinemia and aceruloplasminemiaboth are rare, inherited diseases\\n                \\nChronic liver diseases, such as chronic hepatitis C infection, alcoholic liver disease, or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis\\n                \\nOther factors also can cause secondary hemochromatosis, including:\\n                \\nBlood transfusions\\n                \\nOral iron pills or iron injections, with or without very high vitamin C intake (vitamin C helps your body absorb iron)\\n                \\nLong-term kidney dialysis', \"Hemochromatosis is one of the most common genetic diseases in the United States. It's most common in Caucasians of Northern European descent. The disease is less common in African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, and American Indians.\\n                \\nPrimary hemochromatosis is more common in men than in women. Also, older people are more likely to develop the disease than younger people. In fact, signs and symptoms usually don't occur in men until they're 40 to 60 years old.\\n                \\nIn women, signs and symptoms usually don't occur until after the age of 50 (after menopause). Young children rarely develop hemochromatosis.\\n                \\nInheriting two faulty HFE genes (one from each parent) is the major risk factor for hemochromatosis. However, many people who have two copies of the faulty gene don't develop signs or symptoms of the disease.\\n                \\nAlcoholism is another risk factor for hemochromatosis. A family history of certain diseases and conditions also puts you at higher risk for hemochromatosis. Examples of such diseases and conditions include heart attack, liver disease, diabetes, arthritis, and erectile dysfunction (impotence).\"]}"}, "time": 1746283465.886368}
