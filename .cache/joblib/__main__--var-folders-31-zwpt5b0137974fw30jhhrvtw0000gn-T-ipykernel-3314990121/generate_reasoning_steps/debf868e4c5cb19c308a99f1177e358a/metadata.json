Different types of muscles have different jobs. There are many problems that can affect muscles. Muscle disorders can cause weakness, pain or even paralysis.     Causes of muscle disorders include       - Injury or overuse, such as sprains or strains, cramps or tendinitis     - A genetic disorder, such as muscular dystrophy    - Some cancers    - Inflammation, such as myositis    - Diseases of nerves that affect muscles    - Infections    - Certain medicines       Sometimes the cause is not known.', 'Cartilage is the tough but flexible tissue that covers the ends of your bones at a joint. It also gives shape and support to other parts of your body, such as your ears, nose and windpipe. Healthy cartilage helps you move by allowing your bones to glide over each other. It also protects bones by preventing them from rubbing against each other.     Injured, inflamed, or damaged cartilage can cause symptoms such as pain and limited movement. It can also lead to joint damage and deformity. Causes of cartilage problems include        -  Tears and injuries, such as sports injuries    -  Genetic factors     -  Other disorders, such as some types of arthritis       Osteoarthritis results from breakdown of cartilage.    NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Summary : You have many choices to make about your cancer treatment. One choice you might be thinking about is complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). CAM is the term for medical products and practices that are not part of standard care. Examples of CAM therapies are acupuncture, chiropractic, and herbal medicines.    People with cancer may use CAM to       - Help cope with the side effects of cancer treatments    - Ease worries of cancer treatment and related stress    - Feel that they are doing something more to help their own care       CAM treatments do not work for everyone. Some methods, such as acupuncture, might help with nausea, pain and other side effects of cancer treatment. Talk to your doctor to make sure that all aspects of your cancer care work together.    NIH: National Cancer Institute', 'Summary : Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses a large magnet and radio waves to look at organs and structures inside your body. Health care professionals use MRI scans to diagnose a variety of conditions, from torn ligaments to tumors. MRIs are very useful for examining the brain and spinal cord.     During the scan, you lie on a table that slides inside a tunnel-shaped machine. Doing the scan can take a long time, and you must stay still. The scan is painless. The MRI machine makes a lot of noise. The technician may offer you earplugs.    Before you get a scan, tell your doctor if you        - Are pregnant     - Have pieces of metal in your body. You might have metal in your body if you have a shrapnel or bullet injury or if you are a welder.    - Have metal or electronic devices in your body, such as a cardiac pacemaker or a metal artificial joint']}"}, "time": 1746283467.632394}
