Affected individuals usually do not have hair, teeth, or bone abnormalities. Signs and symptoms are variable, even among affected members of the same family. Less than 20 individuals with anonychia congenita have been identified. This condition is thought to be caused by mutations in the RSPO4 gene and inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Anonychia congenita? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Anonychia congenita. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Anonychia - Autosomal recessive inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'How might anonychia congenita be treated? There is limited information regarding anonychia congenita because it is very rare.  After a careful review of the medical literature, we did not find any information about treatment for this condition.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Facio thoraco genital syndrome?
