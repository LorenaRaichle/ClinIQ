The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Waardenburg syndrome type 3. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Blepharophimosis 90% Finger syndactyly 90% Hearing impairment 90% Limitation of joint mobility 90% Microcephaly 90% Narrow nasal bridge 90% Synostosis of carpal bones 90% Tented upper lip vermilion 90% Thick eyebrow 90% Atelectasis 50% Hypopigmentation of hair 50% Telecanthus 50% Acrocyanosis 7.5% Atria septal defect 7.5% Camptodactyly of finger 7.5% Cognitive impairment 7.5% Hypertonia 7.5% Tracheomalacia 7.5% Aganglionic megacolon - Autosomal dominant contiguous gene syndrome - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Blue irides - Brachydactyly syndrome - Carpal synostosis - Clinodactyly - Cutaneous finger syndactyly - Heterochromia iridis - Hypopigmented skin patches - Intellectual disability - Mandibular prognathia - Partial albinism - Premature graying of hair - Prominent nasal bridge - Scapular winging - Sensorineural hearing impairment - Spastic paraplegia - Synophrys - Variable expressivity - White forelock - Wide nasal bridge - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Orofaciodigital syndrome 5?

Features of this condition include short stature (dwarfism); a very short trunk and neck; abnormal curvature of the spine; barrel-shaped chest; shortened limbs; an abnormality of the hip joint; and problems with vision and hearing. Arthritis and decreased joint mobility often develop early in life. More than 175 cases have been reported in the scientific literature. This condition is caused by mutations in the COL2A1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Most cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no family history of the condition.']}"}, "time": 1746283459.184737}
