He or she also may suspect AAT deficiency if you develop emphysema when you're 45 years old or younger.\\n                \\nSpecialists Involved\\n                \\nMany doctors may be involved in the diagnosis of AAT deficiency. These include primary care doctors, pulmonologists (lung specialists), and hepatologists (liver specialists).\\n                \\nTo diagnose AAT deficiency, your doctor will:\\n                \\nAsk about possible risk factors. Risk factors include smoking and exposure to dust, fumes, and other toxic substances.\\n                \\nAsk about your medical history. A common sign of AAT deficiency is if you have a lung or liver disease without any obvious causes or risk factors. Another sign is if you have emphysema at an unusually early age (45 years or younger).\\n                \\nAsk about your family's medical history. If you have bloodline relatives who have AAT deficiency, you're more likely to have the condition.\\n                \\nDiagnostic Tests\\n                \\nYour doctor may recommend tests to confirm a diagnosis of AAT deficiency. He or she also may recommend tests to check for lung- or liver-related conditions.\\n                \\nA genetic test is the most certain way to check for AAT deficiency. This test will show whether you have faulty AAT genes.\\n                \\nA blood test also may be used. This test checks the level of AAT protein in your blood. If the level is a lot lower than normal, it's likely that you have AAT deficiency.\\n                \\nLung-Related Tests\\n                \\nIf you have a lung disease related to AAT deficiency, your doctor may recommend lung function tests and high-resolution computed tomography (to-MOG-rah-fee) scanning, also called CT scanning.\\n                \\nLung function tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. These tests may show how severe your lung disease is and how well treatment is working.\\n                \\nHigh-resolution CT scanning uses x rays to create detailed pictures of parts of the body. A CT scan can show whether you have emphysema or another lung disease and how severe it is.\", \"Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency has no cure, but its related lung diseases have many treatments. Most of these treatments are the same as the ones used for a lung disease called COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).\\n                \\nIf you have symptoms related to AAT deficiency, your doctor may recommend:\\n                \\nMedicines called inhaled bronchodilators (brong-ko-di-LA-tors) and inhaled steroids. These medicines help open your airways and make breathing easier. They also are used to treat asthma and COPD.\\n                \\nFlu and pneumococcal (noo-mo-KOK-al) vaccines to protect you from illnesses that could make your condition worse. Prompt treatment of lung infections also can help protect your lungs.\\n                \\nPulmonary rehabilitation (rehab). Rehab involves treatment by a team of experts at a special clinic. In rehab, you'll learn how to manage your condition and function at your best.\\n                \\nExtra oxygen, if needed.\\n                \\nA lung transplant. A lung transplant may be an option if you have severe breathing problems. If you have a good chance of surviving the transplant surgery, you may be a candidate for it.\\n                \\nAugmentation (og-men-TA-shun) therapy is a treatment used only for people who have AAT-related lung diseases. This therapy involves getting infusions of the AAT protein. The infusions raise the level of the protein in your blood and lungs.\\n                \\nNot enough research has been done to show how well this therapy works. However, some research suggests that this therapy may slow the development of AAT deficiency in people who don't have severe disease.\\n                \\nPeople who have AAT deficiency and develop related liver or skin diseases will be referred to doctors who treat those diseases.\\n                \\nFuture Treatments\\n                \\nResearchers are working on possible treatments that will target the faulty AAT genes and replace them with healthy genes. These treatments are in the early stages of development.\\n                \\nResearchers also are studying therapies that will help misshapen AAT proteins move from the liver into the bloodstream. They're also studying a type of augmentation therapy in which the AAT protein is inhaled instead of injected into a vein.\\n                \\nIf you're interested in new treatments, ask your doctor about ongoing clinical trials for AAT deficiency.\", 'You can\\'t prevent alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency because the condition is inherited (passed from parents to children through genes).\\n                \\nIf you inherit two faulty AAT genes, you\\'ll have AAT deficiency. Even so, you may never develop one of the diseases related to the condition.\\n                \\nYou can take steps to prevent or delay lung diseases related to AAT deficiency. One important step is to quit smoking. If you don\\'t smoke, don\\'t start.\\n                \\nTalk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.\\n                \\nFor more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Health Topics Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\'s \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.\" Although these resources focus on heart health, they include basic information about how to quit smoking.\\n                \\nAlso, try to avoid secondhand smoke and places with dust, fumes, or other toxic substances that you may inhale.\\n                \\nCheck your living and working spaces for things that may irritate your lungs. Examples include flower and tree pollen, ash, allergens, air pollution, wood burning stoves, paint fumes, and fumes from cleaning products and other household items.\\n                \\nIf you have a lung disease related to AAT deficiency, ask your doctor whether you might benefit from augmentation therapy. This is a treatment in which you receive infusions of AAT protein.\\n                \\nAugmentation therapy raises the level of AAT protein in your blood and lungs. (For more information, go to \"How Is Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Treated?\")', 'Cardiogenic (kar-dee-oh-JE-nik) shock is a condition in which a suddenly weakened heart isn\\'t able to pump enough blood to meet the body\\'s needs. The condition is a medical emergency and is fatal if not treated right away.\\n                \\nThe most common cause of cardiogenic shock is damage to the heart muscle from a severe heart attack. However, not everyone who has a heart attack has cardiogenic shock. In fact, on average, only about 7 percent of people who have heart attacks develop the condition.\\n                \\nIf cardiogenic shock does occur, it\\'s very dangerous. When people die from heart attacks in hospitals, cardiogenic shock is the most common cause of death.\\n                \\nWhat Is Shock?\\n                \\nThe medical term \"shock\" refers to a state in which not enough blood and oxygen reach important organs in the body, such as the brain and kidneys. Shock causes very low blood pressure and may be life threatening.\\n                \\nShock can have many causes. Cardiogenic shock is only one type of shock. Other types of shock include hypovolemic (hy-po-vo-LEE-mik) shock and vasodilatory (VAZ-oh-DILE-ah-tor-e) shock.\\n                \\nHypovolemic shock is a condition in which the heart cant pump enough blood to the body because of severe blood loss.\\n                \\nIn vasodilatory shock, the blood vessels suddenly relax. When the blood vessels are too relaxed, blood pressure drops and blood flow becomes very low. Without enough blood pressure, blood and oxygen dont reach the bodys organs.\\n                \\nA bacterial infection in the bloodstream, a severe allergic reaction, or damage to the nervous system (brain and nerves) may cause vasodilatory shock.\\n                \\nWhen a person is in shock (from any cause), not enough blood and oxygen are reaching the body\\'s organs. If shock lasts more than a few minutes, the lack of oxygen starts to damage the bodys organs. If shock isn\\'t treated quickly, it can cause permanent organ damage or death.\\n                \\nSome of the signs and symptoms of shock include:\\n                \\nConfusion or lack of alertness\\n                \\nLoss of consciousness\\n                \\nA sudden and ongoing rapid heartbeat\\n                \\nSweating\\n                \\nPale skin\\n                \\nA weak pulse\\n                \\nRapid breathing\\n                \\nDecreased or no urine output\\n                \\nCool hands and feet\\n                \\nIf you think that you or someone else is in shock, call 911 right away for emergency treatment. Prompt medical care can save your life and prevent or limit damage to your bodys organs.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nIn the past, almost no one survived cardiogenic shock. Now, about half of the people who go into cardiogenic shock survive. This is because of prompt recognition of symptoms and improved treatments, such as medicines and devices. These treatments can restore blood flow to the heart and help the heart pump better.\\n                \\nIn some cases, devices that take over the pumping function of the heart are used. Implanting these devices requires major surgery.']}"}, "time": 1746283465.34097}
