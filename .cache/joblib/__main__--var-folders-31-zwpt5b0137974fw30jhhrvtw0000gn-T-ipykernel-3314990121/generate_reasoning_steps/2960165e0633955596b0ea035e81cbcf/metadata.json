You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Anemia - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Birth length less than 3rd percentile - Calvarial osteosclerosis - Carious teeth - Congenital hypoparathyroidism - Decreased skull ossification - Delayed closure of the anterior fontanelle - Delayed skeletal maturation - Hypertelorism - Hypocalcemia - Hypomagnesemia - Intrauterine growth retardation - Long clavicles - Proportionate short stature - Recurrent bacterial infections - Seizures - Short foot - Short palm - Slender long bone - Small hand - Tetany - Thin clavicles - Thin ribs - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Progeroid syndrome, Penttinen type?

In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Klippel Feil syndrome (KFS) is a congenital, musculoskeletal condition characterized by the fusion of at least two vertebrae of the neck. Common symptoms include a short neck, low hairline at the back of the head, and restricted mobility of the upper spine. This condition can cause chronic headaches as well as pain in both the neck and the back. Other features may involve various other body parts or systems. Sometimes, KFS occurs as a feature of another disorder or syndrome, such as Wildervanck syndrome or hemifacial microsomia. In these cases, affected people have the features of both KFS and the additional disorder. KFS may be caused by mutations in the GDF6 or GDF3 gene and inherited in an autosomal dominant manner; or, it may be caused by mutations in the MEOX1 gene and inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is symptomatic and may include medications, surgery, and/or physical therapy.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Klippel Feil syndrome? Klippel Feil syndrome is characterized by the fusion of 2 or more spinal bones in the neck (cervical vertebrae). The condition is present from birth (congenital). The 3 most common features include a low posterior hairline (at the back of the head); a short neck; and limited neck range of motion. However, not all affected people have these features. This condition can cause chronic headaches as well as pain in both the neck and the back. KFS has been reported in people with a very wide variety of other conditions and abnormalities, including: scoliosis (curvature of the spine) cervical dystonia (painful, involuntary tensing of the neck muscles) genitourinary abnormalities (those of the reproductive organs and/or urinary system, including the kidneys) Sprengel deformity cardiac (heart) defects such as ventricular septal defect pulmonary abnormalities (relating to the lungs) and respiratory problems hearing deficits facial asymmetry, or other abnormalities of the head and face (such as cleft palate or hemifacial microsomia) torticollis central nervous system abnormalities (including Chiari malformation, spina bifida, or syringomyelia), and/or neurological symptoms other skeletal abnormalities (including those of the ribs, limbs and/or fingers) situs inversus short stature synkinesia (where movement in one hand involuntarily mimics the deliberate movement of the other hand) Wildervank syndrome Duane syndrome or other eye (ocular) abnormalities The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Klippel Feil syndrome.
