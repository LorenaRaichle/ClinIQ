The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Otofaciocervical syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Familial congenital fourth cranial nerve palsy?

Affected individuals can have a wide variety of other signs and symptoms, including loose skin folds due to reduced elasticity (cutis laxa); poor muscle tone (hypotonia); movement disorders; and other features that involve the eyes, face, skin and nervous system. The genetic cause of the condition is not known in most cases, but it is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment generally focuses on the signs and symptoms present in each individual and may include early eye surgery and physiotherapy to avoid contractures.']}"}, "time": 1746283455.001921}
