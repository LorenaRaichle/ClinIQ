These tests are often repeated at specific time periods to check for changes.  - A nuclear heart scan uses radioactive tracers to show damage to heart chambers and major blood vessels.  - Cardiac catheterization involves passing a thin flexible tube through an artery in your groin or arm to look at your coronary arteries. It allows your doctor to examine the blood flow in your heart's chambers.  - Cardiac angiography is usually performed along with cardiac catheterization, using a dye injected through the cardiac catheter. The dye allows the doctor to see where there may be blockages in the coronary arteries. An electrocardiogram, also called an EKG, measures the rate and regularity of your heartbeat.

Restoring blood flow to the heart can prevent or limit damage to the heart muscle and help prevent another heart attack. Doctors may use clot-busting drugs called thrombolytics and procedures, such as angioplasty. Long-term treatment after a heart attack may include cardiac rehabilitation, checkups and tests, lifestyle changes, and medications.', 'Angina is a recurring pain or discomfort in the chest that happens when some part of the heart does not receive enough blood. An episode of angina is not a heart attack. However, people with angina may have a hard time telling the difference between angina and heart attack symptoms. Angina is chest pain or discomfort that occurs when your heart muscle does not get enough blood. Angina may feel like pressure or a squeezing pain in your chest. The pain may also occur in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. It may also feel like indigestion. It is usually relieved within a few minutes by resting or by taking prescribed angina medicine.', 'There are many medicines that are used to treat a heart attack. - Clot-busters or thrombolytic drugs dissolve blood clots that are blocking blood flow to the heart.  - Beta blockers decrease the workload on your heart by slowing your heart rate.  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors lower your blood pressure and reduce the strain on your heart.  - Nitrates, such as nitroglycerin  relax blood vessels and relieve chest pain.  - Anticoagulants thin the blood and prevent clots from forming in your arteries.  - Antiplatelet medications, such as aspirin and clopidogrel, stop platelets from clumping together to form clots. These medications are given to people who have had a heart attack, have angina, or have had angioplasty.

Doctors may also prescribe medicines to relieve pain and anxiety, or to treat irregular heart rhythms which often occur during a heart attack.']}"}, "time": 1746283468.857446}
