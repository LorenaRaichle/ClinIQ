The NYX and CACNA1F genes are located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.  In X-linked recessive inheritance, a female with one altered copy of the gene in each cell is called a carrier. Carriers of an NYX or CACNA1F mutation can pass on the mutated gene, but most do not develop any of the vision problems associated with X-linked congenital stationary night blindness. However, carriers may have retinal changes that can be detected with an electroretinogram.', 'These resources address the diagnosis or management of X-linked congenital stationary night blindness:  - American Optometric Association: Infant Vision  - Gene Review: Gene Review: X-Linked Congenital Stationary Night Blindness  - Genetic Testing Registry: Congenital stationary night blindness  - Genetic Testing Registry: Congenital stationary night blindness, type 1A  - Genetic Testing Registry: Congenital stationary night blindness, type 2A  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Electroretinography  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Eye movements - Uncontrollable  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Nearsightedness  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Strabismus  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Vision - Night Blindness   These resources from MedlinePlus offer information about the diagnosis and management of various health conditions:  - Diagnostic Tests  - Drug Therapy  - Surgery and Rehabilitation  - Genetic Counseling   - Palliative Care', 'X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is an inherited disorder of the immune system that occurs almost exclusively in males. Boys with X-linked SCID are prone to recurrent and persistent infections because they lack the necessary immune cells to fight off certain bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Many infants with X-linked SCID develop chronic diarrhea, a fungal infection called thrush, and skin rashes. Affected individuals also grow more slowly than other children. Without treatment, males with X-linked SCID usually do not live beyond infancy.', 'X-linked SCID is the most common form of severe combined immunodeficiency. Its exact incidence is unknown, but the condition probably affects at least 1 in 50,000 to 100,000 newborns.']}"}, "time": 1746283452.6897652}
