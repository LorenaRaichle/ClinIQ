It occurs in one in 40,000 newborns and girls are four times more likely to be affected than boys.  Though it is usually benign, there is a possibility that the teratoma could become malignant.  As such, the recommended treatment of a teratoma is complete removal of the tumor by surgery, performed soon after the birth.  If not all of the tumor is removed during the initial surgery, the teratoma may grow back (recur) and additional surgeries may be needed.  Studies have found that sacrococcygeal teratomas recur in up to 22% of cases.', \"How might a sacrococcygeal teratoma be treated? The treatment for sacrococcygeal teratoma (SCT) typically involves surgery to remove the tumor. Surgery occurs either in the prenatal period or shortly after delivery. The timing is dependent on the size of the tumor and the associated symptoms. To learn more about both prenatal and postnatal surgery for SCT, visit the following links from The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) http://www.chop.edu/treatments/fetal-surgery-sacrococcygeal-teratoma-sct/about#.VqGW_PkrJD8 http://www.chop.edu/treatments/postnatal-surgery-sacrococcygeal-teratoma-sct#.VqGX7vkrJD8\", 'What are the signs and symptoms of STAR syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for STAR syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Clinodactyly of the 5th finger 90% External ear malformation 90% Short stature 90% Toe syndactyly 90% Urogenital fistula 90% Abnormal localization of kidney 50% Abnormality of female internal genitalia 50% Abnormality of the cardiac septa 50% Female pseudohermaphroditism 50% Midline defect of the nose 50% Renal hypoplasia/aplasia 50% Renal insufficiency 50% Telecanthus 50% Thin vermilion border 50% Vesicoureteral reflux 50% Abnormality of the aortic valve 7.5% Abnormality of the macula 7.5% Abnormality of the pulmonary artery 7.5% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the radius 7.5% Chorioretinal abnormality 7.5% Cleft eyelid 7.5% Mitral stenosis 7.5% Myopia 7.5% Seizures 7.5% Syringomyelia 7.5% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Lichen sclerosus is a chronic skin disorder that is more common in women, most often affecting the external part of the vagina (vulva) or the area around the anus. In men, it typically affects the tip of the penis. It can occur at any age but is usually seen in women over age 50. Some people have no symptoms, while others may experience itchiness (sometimes severe), discomfort, or blistering. It often lasts for years and can cause permanent scarring. The underlying cause of lichen sclerosus is not fully understood but it is thought to relate to an autoimmune process. Treatment may include topical steroids or other types of topical creams and/or surgery.']}"}, "time": 1746283457.6866329}
