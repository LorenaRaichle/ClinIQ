A lack of hemoglobin in the blood causes fatigue. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in red blood cells. It helps carry oxygen to the body.\\n                \\nA low red blood cell count also can cause shortness of breath; dizziness, especially when standing up; headaches; coldness in your hands or feet; pale skin; and chest pain.\\n                \\nIf you don't have enough hemoglobin-carrying red blood cells, your heart has to work harder to move the reduced amount of oxygen in your blood. This can lead to arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), a heart murmur, an enlarged heart, or even heart failure.\\n                \\nWhite Blood Cells\\n                \\nWhite blood cells help fight infections. Signs and symptoms of a low white blood cell count include fevers, frequent infections that can be severe, and flu-like illnesses that linger.\\n                \\nPlatelets\\n                \\nPlatelets stick together to seal small cuts or breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding. People who have low platelet counts tend to bruise and bleed easily, and the bleeding may be hard to stop.\\n                \\nCommon types of bleeding associated with a low platelet count include nosebleeds, bleeding gums, pinpoint red spots on the skin, and blood in the stool. Women also may have heavy menstrual bleeding.\\n                \\nOther Signs and Symptoms\\n                \\nAplastic anemia can cause signs and symptoms that aren't directly related to low blood cell counts. Examples include nausea (feeling sick to your stomach) and skin rashes.\\n                \\nParoxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria\\n                \\nSome people who have aplastic anemia have a condition called paroxysmal (par-ok-SIZ-mal) nocturnal hemoglobinuria (HE-mo-glo-bi-NOO-re-ah), or PNH. This is a red blood cell disorder. Most people who have PNH don't have any signs or symptoms.\\n                \\nIf symptoms do occur, they may include:\\n                \\nShortness of breath\\n                \\nSwelling or pain in the abdomen or swelling in the legs caused by blood clots\\n                \\nBlood in the urine\\n                \\nHeadaches\\n                \\nJaundice (a yellowish color of the skin or whites of the eyes)\\n                \\nIn people who have aplastic anemia and PNH, either condition can develop first.\", \"Your doctor will diagnose aplastic anemia based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and test results.\\n                \\nOnce your doctor knows the cause and severity of the condition, he or she can create a treatment plan for you.\\n                \\nSpecialists Involved\\n                \\nIf your primary care doctor thinks you have aplastic anemia, he or she may refer you to a hematologist. A hematologist is a doctor who specializes in treating blood diseases and disorders.\\n                \\nMedical and Family Histories\\n                \\nYour doctor may ask questions about your medical history, such as whether:\\n                \\nYou've had anemia or a condition that can cause anemia\\n                \\nYou have shortness of breath, dizziness, headaches, or other signs and symptoms of anemia\\n                \\nYou've been exposed to certain toxins or medicines\\n                \\nYou've had radiation or chemotherapy (treatments for cancer)\\n                \\nYou've had infections or signs of infections, such as fever\\n                \\nYou bruise or bleed easily\\n                \\nYour doctor also may ask whether any of your family members have had anemia or other blood disorders.\\n                \\nPhysical Exam\\n                \\nYour doctor will do a physical exam to check for signs of aplastic anemia. He or she will try to find out how severe the disorder is and what's causing it.\\n                \\nThe exam may include checking for pale or yellowish skin and signs of bleeding or infection. Your doctor may listen to your heart and lungs for abnormal heartbeats and breathing sounds. He or she also may feel your abdomen to check the size of your liver and feel your legs for swelling.\\n                \\nDiagnostic Tests\\n                \\nMany tests are used to diagnose aplastic anemia. These tests help:\\n                \\nConfirm a diagnosis of aplastic anemia, look for its cause, and find out how severe it is\\n                \\nRule out other conditions that may cause similar symptoms\\n                \\nCheck for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)\\n                \\nComplete Blood Count\\n                \\nOften, the first test used to diagnose aplastic anemia is a complete blood count (CBC). The CBC measures many parts of your blood.\\n                \\nThis test checks your hemoglobin and hematocrit (hee-MAT-oh-crit) levels. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in red blood cells. It carries oxygen to the body. Hematocrit is a measure of how much space red blood cells take up in your blood. A low level of hemoglobin or hematocrit is a sign of anemia.\\n                \\nThe normal range of these levels varies in certain racial and ethnic populations. Your doctor can explain your test results to you.\\n                \\nThe CBC also checks the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. Abnormal results may be a sign of aplastic anemia, an infection, or another condition.\\n                \\nFinally, the CBC looks at mean corpuscular (kor-PUS-kyu-lar) volume (MCV). MCV is a measure of the average size of your red blood cells. The results may be a clue as to the cause of your anemia.\\n                \\nReticulocyte Count\\n                \\nA reticulocyte (re-TIK-u-lo-site) count measures the number of young red blood cells in your blood. The test shows whether your bone marrow is making red blood cells at the correct rate. People who have aplastic anemia have low reticulocyte levels.\\n                \\nBone Marrow Tests\\n                \\nBone marrow tests show whether your bone marrow is healthy and making enough blood cells. The two bone marrow tests are aspiration (as-pi-RA-shun) and biopsy.\\n                \\nBone marrow aspiration may be done to find out if and why your bone marrow isn't making enough blood cells. For this test, your doctor removes a small amount of bone marrow fluid through a needle. The sample is looked at under a microscope to check for faulty cells.\\n                \\nA bone marrow biopsy may be done at the same time as an aspiration or afterward. For this test, your doctor removes a small amount of bone marrow tissue through a needle.\\n                \\nThe tissue is checked for the number and types of cells in the bone marrow. In aplastic anemia, the bone marrow has a lower than normal number of all three types of blood cells.\\n                \\nOther Tests\\n                \\nOther conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of aplastic anemia. Thus, other tests may be needed to rule out those conditions. These tests may include:\\n                \\nX ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, or an ultrasound imaging test. These tests can show enlarged lymph nodes in your abdomen. Enlarged lymph nodes may be a sign of blood cancer. Doctors also may use these tests to look at the kidneys and the bones in the arms and hands, which are sometimes abnormal in young people who have Fanconi anemia. This type of anemia can lead to aplastic anemia.\\n                \\nChest x ray. This test creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. A chest x ray may be used to rule out infections.\\n                \\nLiver tests and viral studies. These tests are used to check for liver diseases and viruses.\\n                \\nTests that check vitamin B12 and folate levels in the blood. These tests can help rule out anemia caused by vitamin deficiency.\\n                \\nYour doctor also may recommend blood tests for PNH and to check your immune system for proteins called antibodies. (Antibodies in the immune system that attack your bone marrow cells may cause aplastic anemia.)\", \"Treatments for aplastic anemia include blood transfusions, blood and marrow stem cell transplants, and medicines. These treatments can prevent or limit complications, relieve symptoms, and improve quality of life.\\n                \\nBlood and marrow stem cell transplants may cure the disorder in some people who are eligible for a transplant. Removing a known cause of aplastic anemia, such as exposure to a toxin, also may cure the condition.\\n                \\nWho Needs Treatment\\n                \\nPeople who have mild or moderate aplastic anemia may not need treatment as long as the condition doesn't get worse. People who have severe aplastic anemia need medical treatment right away to prevent complications.\\n                \\nPeople who have very severe aplastic anemia need emergency medical care in a hospital. Very severe aplastic anemia can be fatal if it's not treated right away.\\n                \\nBlood Transfusions\\n                \\nBlood transfusions can help keep blood cell counts at acceptable levels. A blood transfusion is a common procedure in which blood is given to you through an intravenous (IV) line in one of your blood vessels.\\n                \\nTransfusions require careful matching of donated blood with the recipient's blood.\\n                \\nBlood transfusions help relieve the symptoms of aplastic anemia, but they're not a permanent treatment.\\n                \\nBlood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplants\\n                \\nA blood and marrow stem cell transplant replaces damaged stem cells with healthy ones from another person (a donor).\\n                \\nDuring the transplant, which is like a blood transfusion, you get donated stem cells through a tube placed in a vein in your chest. Once the stem cells are in your body, they travel to your bone marrow and begin making new blood cells.\\n                \\nBlood and marrow stem cell transplants may cure aplastic anemia in people who can have this type of treatment. The transplant works best in children and young adults with severe aplastic anemia who are in good health and who have matched donors.\\n                \\nOlder people may be less able to handle the treatments needed to prepare the body for the transplant. They're also more likely to have complications after the transplant.\\n                \\nIf you have aplastic anemia, talk with your doctor about whether a blood and marrow stem cell transplant is an option for you.\\n                \\nMedicines\\n                \\nIf you have aplastic anemia, your doctor may prescribe medicines to:\\n                \\nStimulate your bone marrow\\n                \\nSuppress your immune system\\n                \\nPrevent and treat infections\\n                \\nMedicines To Stimulate Bone Marrow\\n                \\nMan-made versions of substances that occur naturally in the body can stimulate the bone marrow to make more blood cells. Examples of these types of medicines include erythropoietin and colony-stimulating factors.\\n                \\nThese medicines have some risks. You and your doctor will work together to decide whether the benefits of these medicines outweigh the risks. If this treatment works well, it can help you avoid the need for blood transfusions.\\n                \\nMedicines To Suppress the Immune System\\n                \\nResearch suggests that aplastic anemia may sometimes occur because the body's immune system attacks its own cells by mistake. For this reason, your doctor may prescribe medicines to suppress your immune system.\\n                \\nThese medicines allow your bone marrow to start making blood cells again. They also may help you avoid the need for blood transfusions.\\n                \\nMedicines that suppress the immune system don't cure aplastic anemia. However, they can relieve its symptoms and reduce complications. These medicines often are used for people who can't have blood and marrow stem cell transplants or who are waiting for transplants.\\n                \\nThree medicinesoften given togethercan suppress the body's immune system. They are antithymocyte globulin (ATG), cyclosporine, and methylprednisolone.\\n                \\nIt may take a few months to notice the effects of these medicines. Most often, as blood cell counts rise, symptoms lessen. Blood cell counts in people who respond well to these medicines usually don't reach normal levels. However, the blood cell counts often are high enough to allow people to do their normal activities.\\n                \\nPeople who have aplastic anemia may need long-term treatment with these medicines.\\n                \\nMedicines that suppress the immune system can have side effects. They also may increase the risk of developing leukemia (lu-KE-me-ah) or myelodysplasia (MI-e-lo-dis-PLA-ze-ah; MDS). Leukemia is a cancer of the blood cells. MDS is a condition in which the bone marrow makes too many faulty blood cells.\\n                \\nMedicines To Prevent and Treat Infections\\n                \\nIf you have aplastic anemia, you might be at risk for infections due to low white blood cell counts. Your doctor may prescribe antibiotic and antiviral medicines to prevent and treat infections.\", \"Espaol\\n                \\nAtherosclerosis is a disease in which plaque builds up inside your arteries. Arteries are blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood to your heart and other parts of your body.\\n                \\nPlaque is made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. Over time, plaque hardens and narrows your arteries. This limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your organs and other parts of your body.\\n                \\nAtherosclerosis can lead to serious problems, including heart attack, stroke, or even death.\\n                \\nAtherosclerosis\\n                \\n\\n                \\nAtherosclerosis-Related Diseases\\n                \\nAtherosclerosis can affect any artery in the body, including arteries in the heart, brain, arms, legs, pelvis, and kidneys. As a result, different diseases may develop based on which arteries are affected.\\n                \\nCoronary Heart Disease\\n                \\nCoronary heart disease (CHD), also called coronary artery disease, occurs when plaque builds up in the coronary arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart.\\n                \\nPlaque narrows the coronary arteries and reduces blood flow to your heart muscle. Plaque buildup also makes it more likely that blood clots will form in your arteries. Blood clots can partially or completely block blood flow.\\n                \\nIf blood flow to your heart muscle is reduced or blocked, you may have angina (chest pain or discomfort) or a heart attack.\\n                \\nPlaque also can form in the heart's smallest arteries. This disease is called coronary microvascular disease (MVD). In coronary MVD, plaque doesn't cause blockages in the arteries as it does in CHD.\\n                \\nCarotid Artery Disease\\n                \\nCarotid (ka-ROT-id) artery disease occurs if plaque builds up in the arteries on each side of your neck (the carotid arteries). These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your brain. If blood flow to your brain is reduced or blocked, you may have a stroke.\\n                \\nPeripheral Artery Disease\\n                \\nPeripheral artery disease (P.A.D.) occurs if plaque builds up in the major arteries that supply oxygen-rich blood to your legs, arms, and pelvis.\\n                \\nIf blood flow to these parts of your body is reduced or blocked, you may have numbness, pain, and, sometimes, dangerous infections.\\n                \\nChronic Kidney Disease\\n                \\nChronic kidney disease can occur if plaque builds up in the renal arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your kidneys.\\n                \\nOver time, chronic kidney disease causes a slow loss of kidney function. The main function of the kidneys is to remove waste and extra water from the body.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nThe cause of atherosclerosis isn't known. However, certain traits, conditions, or habits may raise your risk for the disease. These conditions are known as risk factors.\\n                \\nYou can control some risk factors, such as lack of physical activity, smoking, and an unhealthy diet. Others you can't control, such as age and a family history of heart disease.\\n                \\nSome people who have atherosclerosis have no signs or symptoms. They may not be diagnosed until after a heart attack or stroke.\\n                \\nThe main treatment for atherosclerosis is lifestyle changes. You also may need medicines and medical procedures. These treatments, along with ongoing medical care, can help you live a healthier life.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nImproved treatments have reduced the number of deaths from atherosclerosis-related diseases. These treatments also have improved the quality of life for people who have these diseases. However, atherosclerosis remains a common health problem.\\n                \\nYou may be able to prevent or delay atherosclerosis and the diseases it can cause. Making lifestyle changes and getting ongoing care can help you avoid the problems of atherosclerosis and live a long, healthy life.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283465.431085}
