If leukemia cells are found in the fluid around the brain or spinal cord, the doctor may inject drugs directly into the fluid to ensure that the drugs reach the leukemia cells in the brain.', \"Biological therapy is a treatment that uses a person's own immune system to fight leukemia. This therapy uses special substances to stimulate the immune system's ability to fight cancer. Some patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia receive monoclonal antibodies, which are man-made proteins that can identify leukemia cells and help the body kill them.\", 'Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays to destroy cancer cells.
