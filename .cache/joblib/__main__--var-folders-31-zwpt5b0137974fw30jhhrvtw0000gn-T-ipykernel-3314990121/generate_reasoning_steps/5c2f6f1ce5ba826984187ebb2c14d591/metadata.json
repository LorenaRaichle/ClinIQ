If your parents have missing or altered hemoglobin-making genes, you may have thalassemia.\\n                \\nAncestry\\n                \\nThalassemias occur most often among people of Italian, Greek, Middle Eastern, Southern Asian, and African descent.', \"A lack of oxygen in the bloodstream causes the signs and symptoms of thalassemias. The lack of oxygen occurs because the body doesn't make enough healthy red blood cells and hemoglobin. The severity of symptoms depends on the severity of the disorder.\\n                \\nNo Symptoms\\n                \\nAlpha thalassemia silent carriers generally have no signs or symptoms of the disorder. The lack of alpha globin protein is so minor that the body's hemoglobin works normally.\\n                \\nMild Anemia\\n                \\nPeople who have alpha or beta thalassemia trait can have mild anemia. However, many people who have these types of thalassemia have no signs or symptoms.\\n                \\nMild anemia can make you feel tired. Mild anemia caused by alpha thalassemia trait might be mistaken for iron-deficiency anemia.\\n                \\nMild to Moderate Anemia and Other Signs and Symptoms\\n                \\nPeople who have beta thalassemia intermedia have mild to moderate anemia. They also may have other health problems, such as:\\n                \\nSlowed growth and delayed puberty. Anemia can slow down a child's growth and development.\\n                \\nBone problems. Thalassemia may cause bone marrow to expand. Bone marrow is the spongy substance inside bones that makes blood cells. When bone marrow expands, the bones become wider than normal. They may become brittle and break easily.\\n                \\nAn enlarged spleen. The spleen is an organ that helps your body fight infection and remove unwanted material. When a person has thalassemia, the spleen has to work very hard. As a result, the spleen becomes larger than normal. This makes anemia worse. If the spleen becomes too large, it must be removed.\\n                \\nSevere Anemia and Other Signs and Symptoms\\n                \\nPeople who have hemoglobin H disease or beta thalassemia major (also called Cooley's anemia) have severe thalassemia. Signs and symptoms usually occur within the first 2years of life. They may include severe anemia and other health problems, such as:\\n                \\nA pale and listless appearance\\n                \\nPoor appetite\\n                \\nDark urine (a sign that red blood cells are breaking down)\\n                \\nSlowed growth and delayed puberty\\n                \\nJaundice (a yellowish color of the skin or whites of the eyes)\\n                \\nAn enlarged spleen, liver, or heart\\n                \\nBone problems (especially with bones in the face)\\n                \\nComplications of Thalassemias\\n                \\nBetter treatments now allow people who have moderate and severe thalassemias to live much longer. As a result, these people must cope with complications of these disorders that occur over time.\\n                \\nHeart and Liver Diseases\\n                \\nRegular blood transfusions are a standard treatment for thalassemias. Transfusions can cause iron to build up in the blood (iron overload). This can damage organs and tissues, especially the heart and liver.\\n                \\nHeart disease caused by iron overload is the main cause of death in people who have thalassemias. Heart disease includes heart failure, arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), and heart attack.\\n                \\nInfection\\n                \\nAmong people who have thalassemias, infections are a key cause of illness and the second most common cause of death. People who have had their spleens removed are at even higher risk because they no longer have this infection-fighting organ.\\n                \\nOsteoporosis\\n                \\nMany people who have thalassemias have bone problems, including osteoporosis (OS-te-o-po-RO-sis). This is a condition in which bones are weak and brittle and break easily.\", 'Doctors diagnose thalassemias using blood tests, including a complete blood count (CBC) and special hemoglobin tests.\\n                \\nA CBC measures the amount of hemoglobin and the different kinds of blood cells, such as red blood cells, in a sample of blood. People who have thalassemias have fewer healthy red blood cells and less hemoglobin than normal in their blood. People who have alpha or beta thalassemia trait may have red blood cells that are smaller than normal.\\n                \\nHemoglobin tests measure the types of hemoglobin in a blood sample. People who have thalassemias have problems with the alpha or beta globin protein chains of hemoglobin.\\n                \\nModerate and severe thalassemias usually are diagnosed in early childhood. This is because signs and symptoms, including severe anemia, often occur within the first 2years of life.\\n                \\nPeople who have milder forms of thalassemia might be diagnosed after a routine blood test shows they have anemia. Doctors might suspect thalassemia if a person has anemia and is a member of an ethnic group that\\'s at increased risk for thalassemias. (For more information, go to \"Who Is at Risk for Thalassemias?\")\\n                \\nDoctors also test the amount of iron in the blood to find out whether the anemia is due to iron deficiency or thalassemia. Iron-deficiency anemia occurs if the body doesn\\'t have enough iron to make hemoglobin. The anemia in thalassemia occurs because of a problem with either the alpha globin or beta globin chains of hemoglobin, not because of a lack of iron.\\n                \\nBecause thalassemias are passed from parents to children through genes, family genetic studies also can help diagnose the disorder. These studies involve taking a family medical history and doing blood tests on family members. The tests will show whether any family members have missing or altered hemoglobin genes.\\n                \\nIf you know of family members who have thalassemias and you\\'re thinking of having children, consider talking with your doctor and a genetic counselor. They can help determine your risk for passing the disorder to your children.\\n                \\nIf you\\'re expecting a baby and you and your partner are thalassemia carriers, you may want to consider prenatal testing.\\n                \\nPrenatal testing involves taking a sample of amniotic fluid or tissue from the placenta. (Amniotic fluid is the fluid in the sac surrounding a growing embryo. The placenta is the organ that attaches the umbilical cord to the mother\\'s womb.) Tests done on the fluid or tissue can show whether your baby has thalassemia and how severe it might be.', \"Treatments for thalassemias depend on the type and severity of the disorder. People who are carriers or who have alpha or beta thalassemia trait have mild or no symptoms. Theyll likely need little or no treatment.\\n                \\nDoctors use three standard treatments for moderate and severe forms of thalassemia. These treatments include blood transfusions, iron chelation (ke-LAY-shun) therapy, and folic acid supplements. Other treatments have been developed or are being tested, but they're used much less often.\\n                \\nStandard Treatments\\n                \\nBlood Transfusions\\n                \\nTransfusions of red blood cells are the main treatment for people who have moderate or severe thalassemias. This treatment gives you healthy red blood cells with normal hemoglobin.\\n                \\nDuring a blood transfusion, a needle is used to insert an intravenous (IV) line into one of your blood vessels. Through this line, you receive healthy blood. The procedure usually takes 1 to 4 hours.\\n                \\nRed blood cells live only for about 120 days. So, you may need repeated transfusions to maintain a healthy supply of red blood cells.\\n                \\nIf you have hemoglobin H disease or beta thalassemia intermedia, you may need blood transfusions on occasion. For example, you may have transfusions when you have an infection or other illness, or when your anemia is severe enough to cause tiredness.\\n                \\nIf you have beta thalassemia major (Cooley's anemia), youll likely need regular blood transfusions (often every 2 to 4 weeks). These transfusions will help you maintain normal hemoglobin and red blood cell levels.\\n                \\nBlood transfusions allow you to feel better, enjoy normal activities, and live into adulthood. This treatment is lifesaving, but it's expensive and carries a risk of transmitting infections and viruses (for example, hepatitis). However, the risk is very low in the United States because of careful blood screening.\\n                \\nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Blood Transfusion article.\\n                \\nIron Chelation Therapy\\n                \\nThe hemoglobin in red blood cells is an iron-rich protein. Thus, regular blood transfusions can lead to a buildup of iron in the blood. This condition is called iron overload. It damages the liver, heart, and other parts of the body.\\n                \\nTo prevent this damage, doctors use iron chelation therapy to remove excess iron from the body. Two medicines are used for iron chelation therapy.\\n                \\nDeferoxamine is a liquid medicine that's given slowly under the skin, usually with a small portable pump used overnight. This therapy takes time and can be mildly painful. Side effects include problems with vision and hearing.\\n                \\nDeferasirox is a pill taken once daily. Side effects include headache, nausea (feeling sick to the stomach), vomiting, diarrhea, joint pain, and tiredness.\\n                \\nFolic Acid Supplements\\n                \\nFolic acid is a B vitamin that helps build healthy red blood cells. Your doctor may recommend folic acid supplements in addition to treatment with blood transfusions and/or iron chelation therapy.\\n                \\nOther Treatments\\n                \\nOther treatments for thalassemias have been developed or are being tested, but they're used much less often.\\n                \\nBlood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant\\n                \\nA blood and marrow stem cell transplant replaces faulty stem cells with healthy ones from another person (a donor). Stem cells are the cells inside bone marrow that make red blood cells and other types of blood cells.\\n                \\nA stem cell transplant is the only treatment that can cure thalassemia. But only a small number of people who have severe thalassemias are able to find a good donor match and have the risky procedure.\\n                \\nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant article.\\n                \\nPossible Future Treatments\\n                \\nResearchers are working to find new treatments for thalassemias. For example, it might be possible someday to insert a normal hemoglobin gene into stem cells in bone marrow. This will allow people who have thalassemias to make their own healthy red blood cells and hemoglobin.\\n                \\nResearchers also are studying ways to trigger a person's ability to make fetal hemoglobin after birth. This type of hemoglobin is found in fetuses and newborns. After birth, the body switches to making adult hemoglobin. Making more fetal hemoglobin might make up for the lack of healthy adult hemoglobin.\\n                \\nTreating Complications\\n                \\nBetter treatments now allow people who have moderate and severe thalassemias to live longer. As a result, these people must cope with complications that occur over time.\\n                \\nAn important part of managing thalassemias is treating complications. Treatment might be needed for heart or liver diseases, infections, osteoporosis, and other health problems.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283466.451505}
