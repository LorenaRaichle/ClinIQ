The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of extrapyramidal motor function - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Cerebral atrophy - Dementia - Diplopia - Distal sensory impairment - Dysarthria - Encephalopathy - Gliosis - Myoclonus - Neuronal loss in central nervous system - Nystagmus - Seizures - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Immunotactoid or fibrillary glomerulopathy is a term that includes two conditions: immunotactoid glomerulopathy and fibrillary glomerulonephritis, which are uncommon causes of glomerular disease. Most experts feel that fibrillary glomerulonephritis and immunotactoid glomerulopathy are separate disorders but they have many similarities and some experts group these disorders together. Fibrillary glomerulonephritis and immunotactoid glomerulopathy can be distinguished from each other by electron microscopy; the \\'fibrils\\' that characterize fibrillary glomerulonephritis are smaller and  randomly oriented as opposed to the larger and organized fibrils of immunotactoid glomerulopathy which also have microtubule formations.  Both disorders probably result from deposits derived from immunoglobulins but in most cases the cause is idiopathic (unknown). The signs and symptoms are similar in both diseases and may include blood (hematuria) and protein (proteinuria) in the urine, kidney insufficiency and high blood pressure. Fibrillary glomeurlonephritis is much more common than immunotactoid glomerulopathy.  Both fibrillary glomerulonephritis and immunotactoid glomerulopathy have been associated with hepatitis C virus infection and with malignancy and autoimmune disease, but immunotactoid glomerulopathy patients have a greater predisposition to chronic lymphocytic leukemia and B cell lymphomas. All patients should be screened for these conditions. It is also important to rule out another disease known as amyloidosis. When the fibrils are stained with an acid dye known as \"Congo red\" the results are negative. In amyloidosis the results are positive because the dye is absorbed by the amyloids. Treatment is generally determined by the severity of the kidney problems.', 'Schnitzler syndrome is a rare autoinflammatory condition. Signs and symptoms of the condition vary but may include urticaria; recurrent fevers; joint pain and inflammation; organomegaly (abnormally enlarged organs); and/or blood abnormalities. The exact underlying cause of the condition is unknown; however, most cases occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. Treatment is focused on alleviating the signs and symptoms associated with the condition and may include various medications and/or phototherapy.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Schnitzler syndrome? The signs and symptoms of Schnitzler syndrome vary but may include: Red raised patches of skin (urticaria) that may become itchy Recurrent fevers Join pain and inflammation Organomegaly (enlarged internal organs) often involving the lymph nodes, liver and/or spleen Bone pain Blood abnormalities Muscle aches Fatigue Weight loss People affected by Schnitzler syndrome also have an increased risk of developing certain lymphoproliferative disorders.
