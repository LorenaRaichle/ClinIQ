Sometimes the disease goes away on its own. Whether you need treatment and what type of treatment you need depend on your signs and symptoms, which organs are affected, and whether those organs are working well.\\n                \\nIf the disease affects certain organssuch as your eyes, heart, or brainyou'll need treatment even if you don't have any symptoms.\\n                \\nIn either case, whether you have symptoms or not, you should see your doctor for ongoing care. He or she will want to check to make sure that the disease isn't damaging your organs. For example, you may need routine lung function tests to make sure that your lungs are working well.\\n                \\nIf the disease isn't worsening, your doctor may watch you closely to see whether the disease goes away on its own. If the disease does start to get worse, your doctor can prescribe treatment.\\n                \\nThe goals of treatment include:\\n                \\nRelieving symptoms\\n                \\nImproving organ function\\n                \\nControlling inflammation and reducing the size of granulomas (inflamed lumps)\\n                \\nPreventing pulmonary fibrosis (lung scarring) if your lungs are affected\\n                \\nYour doctor may prescribe topical treatments and/or medicines to treat the disease.\\n                \\nMedicines\\n                \\nPrednisone\\n                \\nPrednisone, a type of steroid, is the main treatment for sarcoidosis. This medicine reduces inflammation. In most people, prednisone relieves symptoms within a couple of months.\\n                \\nAlthough most people need to take prednisone for 12 months or longer, your doctor may lower the dose within a few months after you start the medicine.\\n                \\nLong-term use of prednisone, especially at high doses, can cause serious side effects. Work with your doctor to decide whether the benefits of this medicine outweigh the risks. If your doctor prescribes this treatment, he or she will find the lowest dose that controls your disease.\\n                \\nWhen you stop taking prednisone, you should cut back slowly (as your doctor advises). This will help prevent flareups of sarcoidosis. Cutting back slowly also allows your body to adjust to not having the medicine.\\n                \\nIf a relapse or flareup occurs after you stop taking prednisone, you may need a second round of treatment. If you remain stable for more than 1 year after stopping this treatment, the risk of relapse is low.\\n                \\nOther Medicines\\n                \\nOther medicines, besides prednisone, also are used to treat sarcoidosis. Examples include:\\n                \\nHydroxychloroquine or chloroquine (known as antimalarial medicines). These medicines work best for treating sarcoidosis that affects the skin or brain. Your doctor also may prescribe an antimalarial if you have a high level of calcium in your blood due to sarcoidosis.\\n                \\nMedicines that suppress the immune system, such as methotrexate, azathioprine, or leflunomide. These medicines work best for treating sarcoidosis that affects your lungs, eyes, skin, or joints.\\n                \\nYour doctor may prescribe these medicines if your sarcoidosis worsens while you're taking prednisone or if you can't handle prednisone's side effects.\\n                \\nIf you have Lofgren's syndrome with pain or fever, your doctor may prescribe nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen.\\n                \\nIf you're wheezing and coughing, you may need inhaled medicine to help open your airways. You take inhaled medicine using an inhaler. This device allows the medicine to go straight to your lungs.\\n                \\nAnti-tumor necrosis factor drugs, originally developed to treat arthritis, are being studied to treat sarcoidosis.\\n                \\nOngoing Research\\n                \\nResearchers continue to look for new and better treatments for sarcoidosis. They're currently studying treatments aimed at the immune system. Researchers also are studying antibiotics as a possible treatment for sarcoidosis that affects the skin.\\n                \\nFor more information about ongoing research, go to the Clinical Trials section of this article.\", 'Pernicious anemia (per-NISH-us uh-NEE-me-uh) is a condition in which the body can\\'t make enough healthy red blood cells because it doesn\\'t have enough vitamin B12.\\n                \\nVitamin B12 is a nutrient found in some foods. The body needs this nutrient to make healthy red blood cells and to keep its nervous system working properly.\\n                \\nPeople who have pernicious anemia can\\'t absorb enough vitamin B12 from food. This is because they lack intrinsic (in-TRIN-sik) factor, a protein made in the stomach. A lack of this protein leads to vitamin B12 deficiency.\\n                \\nOther conditions and factors also can cause vitamin B12 deficiency. Examples include infections, surgery, medicines, and diet. Technically, the term \"pernicious anemia\" refers to vitamin B12 deficiency due to a lack of intrinsic factor. Often though, vitamin B12 deficiency due to other causes also is called pernicious anemia.\\n                \\nThis article discusses pernicious anemia due to a lack of intrinsic factor and other causes.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nPernicious anemia is a type of anemia. The term \"anemia\" usually refers to a condition in which the blood has a lower than normal number of red blood cells. In pernicious anemia, the body can\\'t make enough healthy red blood cells because it doesn\\'t have enough vitamin B12.\\n                \\nWithout enough vitamin B12, your red blood cells don\\'t divide normally and are too large. They may have trouble getting out of the bone marrowa sponge-like tissue inside the bones where blood cells are made.\\n                \\nWithout enough red blood cells to carry oxygen to your body, you may feel tired and weak. Severe or long-lasting pernicious anemia can damage the heart, brain, and other organs in the body.\\n                \\nPernicious anemia also can cause other problems, such as nerve damage, neurological problems (such as memory loss), and digestive tract problems. People who have pernicious anemia also may be at higher risk for weakened bone strength and stomach cancer.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nThe term pernicious means deadly. The condition is called pernicious anemia because it often was fatal in the past, before vitamin B12 treatments were available. Now, pernicious anemia usually is easy to treat with vitamin B12 pills or shots.\\n                \\nWith ongoing care and proper treatment, most people who have pernicious anemia can recover, feel well, and live normal lives.\\n                \\nWithout treatment, pernicious anemia can lead to serious problems with the heart, nerves, and other parts of the body. Some of these problems may be permanent.', \"Pernicious anemia is caused by a lack of intrinsic factor or other causes, such as infections, surgery, medicines, or diet.\\n                \\nLack of Intrinsic Factor\\n                \\nIntrinsic factor is a protein made in the stomach. It helps your body absorb vitamin B12. In some people, an autoimmune response causes a lack of intrinsic factor.\\n                \\nAn autoimmune response occurs if the bodys immune system makes antibodies (proteins) that mistakenly attack and damage the body's tissues or cells.\\n                \\nIn pernicious anemia, the body makes antibodies that attack and destroy the parietal (pa-RI-eh-tal) cells. These cells line the stomach and make intrinsic factor. Why this autoimmune response occurs isn't known.\\n                \\nAs a result of this attack, the stomach stops making intrinsic factor. Without intrinsic factor, your body can't move vitamin B12 through the small intestine, where it's absorbed. This leads to vitamin B12 deficiency.\\n                \\nA lack of intrinsic factor also can occur if you've had part or all of your stomach surgically removed. This type of surgery reduces the number of parietal cells available to make intrinsic factor.\\n                \\nRarely, children are born with an inherited disorder that prevents their bodies from making intrinsic factor. This disorder is called congenital pernicious anemia.\\n                \\nOther Causes\\n                \\nPernicious anemia also has other causes, besides a lack of intrinsic factor. Malabsorption in the small intestine and a diet lacking vitamin B12 both can lead to pernicious anemia.\\n                \\nMalabsorption in the Small Intestine\\n                \\nSometimes pernicious anemia occurs because the body's small intestine can't properly absorb vitamin B12. This may be the result of:\\n                \\nToo many of the wrong kind of bacteria in the small intestine. This is a common cause of pernicious anemia in older adults. The bacteria use up the available vitamin B12 before the small intestine can absorb it.\\n                \\nDiseases that interfere with vitamin B12 absorption. One example is celiac disease. This is a genetic disorder in which your body can't tolerate a protein called gluten. Another example is Crohn's disease, an inflammatory bowel disease. HIV also may interfere with vitamin B12 absorption.\\n                \\nCertain medicines that alter bacterial growth or prevent the small intestine from properly absorbing vitamin B12. Examples include antibiotics and certain diabetes and seizure medicines.\\n                \\nSurgical removal of part or all of the small intestine.\\n                \\nA tapeworm infection. The tapeworm feeds off of the vitamin B12. Eating undercooked, infected fish may cause this type of infection.\\n                \\nDiet Lacking Vitamin B12\\n                \\nSome people get pernicious anemia because they don't have enough vitamin B12 in their diets. This cause of pernicious anemia is less common than other causes.\\n                \\nGood food sources of vitamin B12 include:\\n                \\nBreakfast cereals with added vitamin B12\\n                \\nMeats such as beef, liver, poultry, and fish\\n                \\nEggs and dairy products (such as milk, yogurt, and cheese)\\n                \\nFoods fortified with vitamin B12, such as soy-based beverages and vegetarian burgers\\n                \\nStrict vegetarians who don't eat any animal or dairy products and don't take a vitamin B12 supplement are at risk for pernicious anemia.\\n                \\nBreastfed infants of strict vegetarian mothers also are at risk for pernicious anemia. These infants can develop anemia within months of being born. This is because they haven't had enough time to store vitamin B12 in their bodies. Doctors treat these infants with vitamin B12 supplements.\\n                \\nOther groups, such as the elderly and people who suffer from alcoholism, also may be at risk for pernicious anemia. These people may not get the proper nutrients in their diets.\", \"Pernicious anemia is more common in people of Northern European and African descent than in other ethnic groups.\\n                \\nOlder people also are at higher risk for the condition. This is mainly due to a lack of stomach acid and intrinsic factor, which prevents the small intestine from absorbing vitamin B12. As people grow older, they tend to make less stomach acid.\\n                \\nPernicious anemia also can occur in younger people and other populations. You're at higher risk for pernicious anemia if you:\\n                \\nHave a family history of the condition.\\n                \\nHave had part or all of your stomach surgically removed. The stomach makes intrinsic factor. This protein helps your body absorb vitamin B12.\\n                \\nHave an autoimmune disorder that involves the endocrine glands, such as Addison's disease, type 1 diabetes, Graves' disease, or vitiligo. Research suggests a link may exist between these autoimmune disorders and pernicious anemia that's caused by an autoimmune response.\\n                \\nHave had part or all of your small intestine surgically removed. The small intestine is where vitamin B12 is absorbed.\\n                \\nHave certain intestinal diseases or other disorders that may prevent your body from properly absorbing vitamin B12. Examples include Crohn's disease, intestinal infections, and HIV.\\n                \\nTake medicines that prevent your body from properly absorbing vitamin B12. Examples of such medicines include antibiotics and certain seizure medicines.\\n                \\nAre a strict vegetarian who doesn't eat any animal or dairy products and doesn't take a vitamin B12 supplement, or if you eat poorly overall.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283465.578219}
