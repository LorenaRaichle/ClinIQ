However, not everyone who is obese develops OHS. Researchers don\\'t fully know why only some people who are obese develop the condition.\\n                \\nAdopting healthy habits can help you maintain a healthy weight. Many lifestyle habits begin during childhood. So, it\\'s important to make following a healthy lifestyle a family goal.\\n                \\nA healthy diet is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. A healthy diet includes a variety of vegetables and fruits. It also includes whole grains, fat-free or low-fat dairy products, and protein foods, such as lean meats, eggs, poultry without skin, seafood, nuts, seeds, beans, and peas.\\n                \\nA healthy diet is low in sodium (salt), added sugars, solid fats, and refined grains. Solid fats are saturated fat and trans fatty acids. Refined grains come from processing whole grains, which results in a loss of nutrients (such as dietary fiber). Examples of refined grains include white rice and white bread.\\n                \\nFor more information about following a healthy diet, go to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\'s \"Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH\" and the U.S. Department of Agriculture\\'s ChooseMyPlate.gov Web site. Both resources provide general information about healthy eating.\\n                \\nTo adopt other healthy lifestyle habits, follow these tips:\\n                \\nFocus on portion size. Watch the portion sizes in fast food and other restaurants. The portions served often are enough for two or three people. Children\\'s portion sizes should be smaller than those for adults. Cutting back on portion sizes will help you manage your calorie intake.\\n                \\nBe physically active. Make personal and family time as active as possible. Find activities that everyone will enjoy. For example, go for a brisk walk, bike or rollerblade, or train together for a walk or run.\\n                \\nReduce screen time. Limit the use of TVs, computers, DVDs, and videogames; they cut back on the time for physical activity. Health experts recommend2 hours or less a day of screen time that\\'s not work- or homework-related.\\n                \\nKeep track of your weight and body mass index (BMI). BMI is calculated from your height and weight. In adults, a BMI of 30 or more is considered obese. You can use the NHLBI\\'s online BMI calculator to figure out your BMI, or your doctor can help you.\\n                \\nFor more information, go to the prevention section of the Health Topics Overweight and Obesity article.\\n                \\nEven if you have OHS, you might be able to prevent the condition from worsening. For example, avoid alcohol, sedatives, and narcotics. These substances can interfere with how well your body is able to maintain normal carbon dioxide and oxygen levels.', 'Fanconi anemia (fan-KO-nee uh-NEE-me-uh), or FA, is a rare, inherited blood disorder that leads to bone marrow failure. The disorder also is called Fanconis anemia.\\n                \\nFA prevents your bone marrow from making enough new blood cells for your body to work normally. FA also can cause your bone marrow to make many faulty blood cells. This can lead to serious health problems, such as leukemia (a type of blood cancer).\\n                \\nAlthough FA is a blood disorder, it also can affect many of your body\\'s organs, tissues, and systems. Children who inherit FA are at higher risk of being born with birth defects. FA also increases the risk of some cancers and other serious health problems.\\n                \\nFA is different from Fanconi syndrome. Fanconi syndrome affects the kidneys. It\\'s a rare and serious condition that mostly affects children.\\n                \\nChildren who have Fanconi syndrome pass large amounts of key nutrients and chemicals through their urine. These children may have serious health and developmental problems.\\n                \\nBone Marrow and Blood\\n                \\nBone marrow is the spongy tissue inside the large bones of your body. Healthy bone marrow contains stem cells that develop into the three types of blood cells that the body needs:\\n                \\nRed blood cells, which carry oxygen to all parts of your body. Red blood cells also remove carbon dioxide (a waste product) from your body\\'s cells and carry it to the lungs to be exhaled.\\n                \\nWhite blood cells, which help fight infections.\\n                \\nPlatelets (PLATE-lets), which help your blood clot.\\n                \\nIt\\'s normal for blood cells to die. The lifespan of red blood cells is about 120 days. White blood cells live less than 1 day. Platelets live about 6 days. As a result, your bone marrow must constantly make new blood cells.\\n                \\nIf your bone marrow can\\'t make enough new blood cells to replace the ones that die, serious health problems can occur.\\n                \\nFanconi Anemia and Your Body\\n                \\nFA is one of many types of anemia. The term \"anemia\" usually refers to a condition in which the blood has a lower than normal number of red blood cells.\\n                \\nFA is a type of aplastic anemia. In aplastic anemia, the bone marrow stops making or doesn\\'t make enough of all three types of blood cells. Low levels of the three types of blood cells can harm many of the body\\'s organs, tissues, and systems.\\n                \\nWith too few red blood cells, your body\\'s tissues won\\'t get enough oxygen to work well. With too few white blood cells, your body may have problems fighting infections. This can make you sick more often and make infections worse. With too few platelets, your blood cant clot normally. As a result, you may have bleeding problems.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nPeople who have FA have a greater risk than other people for some cancers. About 10percent of people who have FA develop leukemia.\\n                \\nPeople who have FA and survive to adulthood are much more likely than others to develop cancerous solid tumors.\\n                \\nThe risk of solid tumors increases with age in people who have FA. These tumors can develop in the mouth, tongue, throat, or esophagus (eh-SOF-ah-gus). (The esophagus is the passage leading from the mouth to the stomach.)\\n                \\nWomen who have FA are at much greater risk than other women of developing tumors in the reproductive organs.\\n                \\nFA is an unpredictable disease. The average lifespan for people who have FA is between 20 and 30 years. The most common causes of death related to FA are bone marrow failure, leukemia, and solid tumors.\\n                \\nAdvances in care and treatment have improved the chances of surviving longer with FA. Blood and marrow stem cell transplant is the major advance in treatment. However, even with this treatment, the risk of some cancers is greater in people who have FA.', 'Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited disease. The term inherited means that the disease is passed from parents to children through genes. At least 13 faulty genes are associated with FA. FA occurs when both parents pass the same faulty FA gene to their child.\\n                \\nPeople who have only one faulty FA gene are FA \"carriers.\" Carriers don\\'t have FA, but they can pass the faulty gene to their children.\\n                \\nIf both of your parents have a faulty FA gene, you have:\\n                \\nA 25 percent chance of having FA\\n                \\nA 25 percent chance of not having FA\\n                \\nA 50 percent chance of being an FA carrier and passing the gene to any children you have\\n                \\nIf only one of your parents has a faulty FA gene, you won\\'t have the disorder. However, you have a 50 percent chance of being an FA carrier and passing the gene to any children you have.', \"Fanconi anemia (FA) occurs in all racial and ethnic groups and affects men and women equally.\\n                \\nIn the United States, about 1 out of every 181 people is an FA carrier. This carrier rate leads to about 1 in 130,000 people being born with FA.\\n                \\nTwo ethnic groups, Ashkenazi Jews and Afrikaners, are more likely than other groups to have FA or be FA carriers.\\n                \\nAshkenazi Jews are people who are descended from the Jewish population of Eastern Europe. Afrikaners are White natives of South Africa who speak a language called Afrikaans. This ethnic group is descended from early Dutch, French, and German settlers.\\n                \\nIn the United States, 1 out of 90 Ashkenazi Jews is an FA carrier, and 1 out of 30,000 is born with FA.\\n                \\nMajor Risk Factors\\n                \\nFA is an inherited diseasethat is, it's passed from parents to children through genes. At least 13 faulty genes are associated with FA. FA occurs if both parents pass the same faulty FA gene to their child.\\n                \\nChildren born into families with histories of FA are at risk of inheriting the disorder. Children whose mothers and fathers both have family histories of FA are at even greater risk. A family history of FA means that it's possible that a parent carries a faulty gene associated with the disorder.\\n                \\nChildren whose parents both carry the same faulty gene are at greatest risk of inheriting FA. Even if these children aren't born with FA, they're still at risk of being FA carriers.\\n                \\nChildren who have only one parent who carries a faulty FA gene also are at risk of being carriers. However, they're not at risk of having FA.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283466.007925}
