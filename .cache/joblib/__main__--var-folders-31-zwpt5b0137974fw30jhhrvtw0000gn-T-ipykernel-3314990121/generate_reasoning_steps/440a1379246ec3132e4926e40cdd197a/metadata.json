Treatment depends on the size, location, and aggressiveness of porokeratosis of Mibelli.  Affected individuals are recommended to visit their personal physician regularly to watch for signs of skin cancer, limit sun exposure to the affected area, and use moisturizers as needed.  Imiquimod cream has been found to be an effective treatment, as has 5-fluorouracil cream.  A group of medications called retinoids (including acitretin and isotretinoin), as a pill or cream, may be another treatment option.  If a skin cancer develops from porokeratosis of Mibelli, surgery is recommended.', \"Hypertryptophanemia is a rare condition that likely occurs due to abnormalities in the body's ability to process the amino acid (a building block of proteins), tryptophan. People affected by this condition may experience intellectual disability and behavioral problems (i.e. periodic mood swings, exaggerated emotional responses and abnormal sexual behavior). The underlying genetic cause of hypertryptophanemia is currently unknown; however, it appears to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.\", 'What are the signs and symptoms of Hypertryptophanemia? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Hypertryptophanemia. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal dermatoglyphics 90% Neurological speech impairment 90% Abnormality of the elbow 50% Abnormality of the femur 50% Abnormality of the hip bone 50% Abnormality of the knees 50% Abnormality of the ulna 50% Abnormality of the wrist 50% Adducted thumb 50% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the radius 50% Asymmetry of the thorax 50% Cognitive impairment 50% EEG abnormality 50% Hyperhidrosis 50% Hypertelorism 50% Joint hypermobility 50% Myopia 50% Strabismus 50% Ulnar deviation of finger 50% Aggressive behavior - Camptodactyly of finger - Emotional lability - Generalized joint laxity - Hypersexuality - Limited elbow extension - Pes planus - Tryptophanuria - Visual impairment - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Autosomal dominant craniometaphyseal dysplasia is a genetic skeletal condition characterized by progressive thickening of bones in the skull (cranium) and abnormalities at the ends of long bones in the limbs (metaphyseal dysplasia). The overgrowth of bones in the head can lead to distinctive facial features and delayed tooth eruption, as well as compression of the cranial nerves. If untreated, compression of the cranial nerves can be disabling. The condition is caused by mutations in the ANKH gene. As the name suggests, it is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Treatment may include surgery to reduce compression of cranial nerves and recontouring of the facial bones.']}"}, "time": 1746283457.568833}
