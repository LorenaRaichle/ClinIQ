A diagnosis of tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) may be suspected based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms or abnormal pulmonary function tests. Additional testing such as CT scan and bronchoscopy can then be performed to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate the severity of the condition. TBM is considered mild if the trachea narrows to 50% of its initial size while the affected person is breathing out, moderate if it narrows to 25%, and severe if the walls of the trachea touch.', 'How might tracheobronchomalacia be treated? Treatment is only medically necessary in people who have signs and symptoms of tracheobronchomalacia (TBM). Management of symptomatic TBM first involves identifying underlying conditions contributing to symptoms, such as chronic inflammation, compression, or injury. Initial treatment will target these underlying medical concerns. If symptoms persist, people with TBM may undergo pulmonary function tests or other assessments to help guide therapy choice and allow monitoring of the response to treatment. Treatment options may include: Silicone and/or long-term stenting Surgical correction Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) Tracheostomy (often used as a last resort as it can sometimes worsen TBM) We strongly recommend that you discuss your treatment options with a healthcare provider.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Craniosynostosis-mental retardation syndrome of Lin and Gettig? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Craniosynostosis-mental retardation syndrome of Lin and Gettig. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Agenesis of corpus callosum - Ambiguous genitalia, male - Arnold-Chiari type I malformation - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Blepharophimosis - Camptodactyly - Cleft palate - Craniosynostosis - Cryptorchidism - Decreased palmar creases - Dolichocephaly - Epicanthus - Feeding difficulties in infancy - Glabellar hemangioma - Hand clenching - Hydronephrosis - Hypertelorism - Hypertonia - Hypoplasia of midface - Hypoplastic philtrum - Hypospadias - Hypotelorism - Inguinal hernia - Intellectual disability, progressive - Intellectual disability, severe - Intestinal malrotation - Joint contracture of the hand - Long philtrum - Low-set ears - Malar flattening - Micropenis - Microtia - Multiple joint contractures - Multiple small bowel atresias - Narrow chest - Omphalocele - Pectus carinatum - Pectus excavatum - Ptosis - Sensorineural hearing impairment - Short columella - Short nose - Slender finger - Smooth philtrum - Stenosis of the external auditory canal - Strabismus - Supernumerary nipple - Thin vermilion border - Trigonocephaly - Turricephaly - Umbilical hernia - Upslanted palpebral fissure - Ventricular septal defect - Vesicoureteral reflux - Wide intermamillary distance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Hypochromic microcytic anemia with iron overload?
