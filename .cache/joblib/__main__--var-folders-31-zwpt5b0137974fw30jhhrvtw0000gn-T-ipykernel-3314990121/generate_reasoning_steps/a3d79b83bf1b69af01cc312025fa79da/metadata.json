Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Spinal muscular atrophy type 1 with congenital bone fractures?

The severity of the condition, the associated signs and symptoms and the disease progression vary significantly by type. Common features include hypotonia; progressive muscle weakness and degeneration (atrophy); joint contractures; and delayed motor milestones (i.e. sitting up, walking, etc). CMD can be caused by a variety of different genes. Most forms are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Bardet-Biedl syndrome 2?
