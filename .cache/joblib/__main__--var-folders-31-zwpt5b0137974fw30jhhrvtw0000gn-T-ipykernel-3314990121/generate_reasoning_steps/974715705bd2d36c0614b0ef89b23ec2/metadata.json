Endometrial stromal sarcoma, specifically, develops in the supporting connective tissue (stroma) of the uterus. Signs and symptoms of the condition include abnormal uterine bleeding (i.e. bleeding that is not part of menstrual periods or bleeding after menopause); abdominal pain and/or distension; and frequent urination. The exact underlying cause of endometrial stromal sarcoma is currently unknown. Most cases occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. Treatment varies based on the severity of the condition but may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and/or hormone therapy.', \"Brown syndrome is an eye disorder characterized by abnormalities in the eye's ability to move. Specifically, the ability to look up and in is affected by a problem in the superior oblique muscle/tendon. The condition may be present at birth (congenital) or it may develop following surgery or as a result of inflammation or a problem with development. Some cases are constant while other are intermittent. Treatment depends upon the cause and severity of the movement disorder. Options include close observation, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents like Ibuprofen, corticosteroids, and surgery.\", \"How might Brown syndrome be treated? Treatment recommendations vary depending on the cause and severity of the condition. In mild cases, a watch and wait approach may be sufficient. Visual acuity should be monitored. First line therapy usually involves less invasive options such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications like Ibuprofen.  Acquired cases of inflammatory Brown syndrome may be successfully treated with corticosteroids. Surgery is considered in cases which present with double vision, compromised binocular vision, significant abnormalities in head position or obvious eye misalignment when looking straight ahead.  You can find additional information regarding treatment of Brown syndrome through PubMed, a searchable database of biomedical journal articles. Although not all of the articles are available for free online, most articles listed in PubMed have a summary available. To obtain the full article, contact a medical/university library or your local library for interlibrary loan. You can also order articles online through the publishers Web site.

The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal dominant inheritance - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Distal renal tubular acidosis - Failure to thrive - Hypocalcemia - Metabolic acidosis - Nephrocalcinosis - Osteomalacia - Pathologic fracture - Periodic hypokalemic paresis - Periodic paralysis - Postnatal growth retardation - Renal tubular acidosis - Rickets - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.']}"}, "time": 1746283459.48677}
