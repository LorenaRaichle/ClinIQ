However, experts have not found enough evidence to support their use.\\n                \\nPrednisone\\n                \\nPrednisone is an anti-inflammatory medicine. You usually take it by mouth every day. However, your doctor may give it to you through a needle or tube inserted into a vein in your arm for several days. After that, you usually take it by mouth.\\n                \\nBecause prednisone can cause serious side effects, your doctor may prescribe it for 3 to 6 months or less at first. Then, if it works for you, your doctor may reduce the dose over time and keep you on it longer.\\n                \\nAzathioprine\\n                \\nAzathioprine suppresses your immune system.

Most people who have IPF also have GERD.\\n                \\nOxygen Therapy\\n                \\nIf the amount of oxygen in your blood gets low, you may need oxygen therapy. Oxygen therapy can help reduce shortness of breath and allow you to be more active.\\n                \\nOxygen usually is given through nasal prongs or a mask. At first, you may need it only during exercise and sleep.

A lung transplant can improve your quality of life and help you live longer.\\n                \\nSome medical centers will consider patients older than 65 for lung transplants if they have no other serious medical problems.\\n                \\nThe major complications of a lung transplant are rejection and infection. (\"Rejection\" refers to your body creating proteins that attack the new organ.) You will have to take medicines for the rest of your life to reduce the risk of rejection.\\n                \\nBecause the supply of donor lungs is limited, talk with your doctor about a lung transplant as soon as possible.\\n                \\nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Lung Transplant article.', \"Espaol\\n                \\nCoronary heart disease (CHD) is a disease in which a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside the coronary arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle.\\n                \\nWhen plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis. The buildup of plaque occurs over many years.\\n                \\nAtherosclerosis\\n                \\n\\n                \\nOver time, plaque can harden or rupture (break open). Hardened plaque narrows the coronary arteries and reduces the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart.\\n                \\nIf the plaque ruptures, a blood clot can form on its surface. A large blood clot can mostly or completely block blood flow through a coronary artery. Over time, ruptured plaque also hardens and narrows the coronary arteries.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nIf the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle is reduced or blocked, angina or a heart attack can occur.\\n                \\nAngina is chest pain or discomfort. It may feel like pressure or squeezing in your chest. The pain also can occur in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. Angina pain may even feel like indigestion.\\n                \\nA heart attack occurs if the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle is cut off. If blood flow isnt restored quickly, the section of heart muscle begins to die. Without quick treatment, a heart attack can lead to serious health problems or death.\\n                \\nOver time, CHD can weaken the heart muscle and lead to heart failure and arrhythmias. Heart failure is a condition in which your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your bodys needs. Arrhythmias are problems with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nLifestyle changes, medicines, and medical procedures can help prevent or treat coronary heart disease. These treatments may reduce the risk of related health problems.\", 'Research suggests that coronary heart disease (CHD) starts when certain factors damage the inner layers of the coronary arteries. These factors include:\\n                \\nSmoking\\n                \\nHigh levels of certain fats and cholesterol in the blood\\n                \\nHigh blood pressure\\n                \\nHigh levels of sugar in the blood due to insulin resistance or diabetes\\n                \\nBlood vessel inflammation\\n                \\nPlaque might begin to build up where the arteries are damaged. The buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries may start in childhood.\\n                \\nOver time, plaque can harden or rupture (break open). Hardened plaque narrows the coronary arteries and reduces the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart. This can cause angina (chest pain or discomfort).\\n                \\nIf the plaque ruptures, blood cell fragments called platelets (PLATE-lets) stick to the site of the injury. They may clump together to form blood clots.\\n                \\nBlood clots can further narrow the coronary arteries and worsen angina. If a clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block a coronary artery and cause a heart attack.', 'In the United States, coronary heart disease (CHD) is a leading cause of death for both men and women. Each year, about 370,000 Americans die from coronary heart disease.\\n                \\nCertain traits, conditions, or habits may raise your risk for CHD. The more risk factors you have, the more likely you are to develop the disease.\\n                \\nYou can control many risk factors, which may help prevent or delay CHD.\\n                \\nMajor Risk Factors\\n                \\nUnhealthy blood cholesterol levels. This includes high LDL cholesterol (sometimes called bad cholesterol) and low HDL cholesterol (sometimes called good cholesterol).\\n                \\nHigh blood pressure. Blood pressure is considered high if it stays at or above 140/90 mmHg over time. If you have diabetes or chronic kidney disease, high blood pressure is defined as 130/80 mmHg or higher. (The mmHg is millimeters of mercurythe units used to measure blood pressure.)\\n                \\nSmoking. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels, lead to unhealthy cholesterol levels, and raise blood pressure. Smoking also can limit how much oxygen reaches the body\\'s tissues.\\n                \\nInsulin resistance. This condition occurs if the body can\\'t use its own insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone that helps move blood sugar into cells where it\\'s used for energy. Insulin resistance may lead to diabetes.\\n                \\nDiabetes. With this disease, the body\\'s blood sugar level is too high because the body doesn\\'t make enough insulin or doesn\\'t use its insulin properly.\\n                \\nOverweight or obesity. The terms overweight and obesity refer to body weight thats greater than what is considered healthy for a certain height.\\n                \\nMetabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is the name for a group of risk factors that raises your risk for CHD and other health problems, such as diabetes and stroke.\\n                \\nLack of physical activity. Being physically inactive can worsen other risk factors for CHD, such as unhealthy blood cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, diabetes, and overweight or obesity.\\n                \\nUnhealthy diet. An unhealthy diet can raise your risk for CHD. Foods that are high in saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, sodium, and sugar can worsen other risk factors for CHD.\\n                \\nOlder age. Genetic or lifestyle factors cause plaque to build up in your arteries as you age. In men, the risk for coronary heart disease increases starting at age 45. In women, the risk for coronary heart disease increases starting at age 55.\\n                \\nA family history of early coronary heart disease is a risk factor for developing coronary heart disease, specifically if a father or brother is diagnosed before age 55, or a mother or sister is diagnosed before age 65.\\n                \\nAlthough older age and a family history of early heart disease are risk factors, it doesn\\'t mean that youll develop CHD if you have one or both. Controlling other risk factors often can lessen genetic influences and help prevent CHD, even in older adults.\\n                \\nEmerging Risk Factors\\n                \\nResearchers continue to study other possible risk factors for CHD.\\n                \\nHigh levels of a protein called C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood may raise the risk of CHD and heart attack. High levels of CRP are a sign of inflammation in the body.\\n                \\nInflammation is the body\\'s response to injury or infection. Damage to the arteries\\' inner walls may trigger inflammation and help plaque grow.\\n                \\nResearch is under way to find out whether reducing inflammation and lowering CRP levels also can reduce the risk of CHD and heart attack.\\n                \\nHigh levels of triglycerides in the blood also may raise the risk of CHD, especially in women. Triglycerides are a type of fat.\\n                \\nOther Risks Related to Coronary Heart Disease\\n                \\nOther conditions and factors also may contribute to CHD, including:\\n                \\nSleep apnea. Sleep apnea is a common disorder in which you have one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep. Untreated sleep apnea can increase your risk for high blood pressure, diabetes, and even a heart attack or stroke.\\n                \\nStress. Research shows that the most commonly reported \"trigger\" for a heart attack is an emotionally upsetting event, especially one involving anger.\\n                \\nAlcohol. Heavy drinking can damage the heart muscle and worsen other CHD risk factors. Men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day.\\n                \\nPreeclampsia. This condition can occur during pregnancy. The two main signs of preeclampsia are a rise in blood pressure and excess protein in the urine. Preeclampsia is linked to an increased lifetime risk of heart disease, including CHD, heart attack, heart failure, and high blood pressure.\\n                \\nFor more detailed information, go to the Health Topics Coronary Heart Disease Risk Factors article.']}"}, "time": 1746283466.367358}
