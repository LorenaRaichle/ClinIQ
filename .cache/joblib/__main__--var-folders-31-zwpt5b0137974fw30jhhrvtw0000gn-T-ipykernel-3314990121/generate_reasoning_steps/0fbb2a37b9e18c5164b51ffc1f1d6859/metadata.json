People affected by this condition may experience a headache and fever for up to 5 days, followed by personality and behavioral changes; seizures; hallucinations; and altered levels of consciousness. Without early diagnosis and treatment, severe brain damage or even death may occur. Herpes simplex encephalitis is caused by a virus called the herpes simplex virus. Most cases are associated with herpes simplex virus type I (the cause of cold sores or fever blisters), although rare cases can be caused by herpes simplex virus type II (genital herpes). It is poorly understood why some people who are infected with herpes simplex virus develop herpes simplex encephalitis while others do not. Changes (mutations) in genes such as TLR3 and TRAF3 have been observed suggesting there may be a genetic component in some cases. Treatment consists of antiviral therapy.', 'Hidradenocarcinoma is a tumor caused by the abnormal growth of cells in a sweat gland.  It is a type of cancer that usually begins as a single spot (lesion) on the skin of the head or neck, but it has also been found on other parts of the body.  This type of tumor typically develops in older individuals (after age 40).  Each hidradenocarcinoma develops differently over time; some may stay the same size and others grow rapidly.  Sometimes it may spread into nearby tissues, or to more distant parts of the body in a process called metastasis.  It is not known why some hidradenocarcinomas progress rapidly while others remain stable.', 'How might hidradenocarcinoma be treated? Because hidradenocarcinoma is quite rare, there are no established guidelines for treatment.  Treatment is determined by the size and location of each particular cancer and the extent to which cancer cells may have spread to nearby lymph nodes or tissues.  Surgery is often the first step and aims to remove as much of the cancer as possible.  Both a traditional surgical technique, known as wide local excision, and the newer Mohs micrographic surgery have been used to remove hidradenocarcinomas.  Radiation therapy, performed by a doctor known as radiation oncologist, has been used after surgery in patients with hidradenocarcinoma to destroy any cancer cells that may remain at the original location of the tumor or in the lymph nodes.  Chemotherapy, performed by a doctor known as a medical oncologist, has not yet been proven as effective treatment for hidradenocarcinomas.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Camptodactyly syndrome Guadalajara type 1? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Camptodactyly syndrome Guadalajara type 1. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal form of the vertebral bodies 90% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the earlobes 90% Camptodactyly of finger 90% Dental malocclusion 90% Malar flattening 90% Pectus carinatum 90% Pectus excavatum 90% Telecanthus 90% Abnormality of calvarial morphology 50% Abnormality of the palate 50% Anteverted nares 50% Brachydactyly syndrome 50% Cognitive impairment 50% Cubitus valgus 50% Delayed skeletal maturation 50% Depressed nasal bridge 50% Downturned corners of mouth 50% Epicanthus 50% Hallux valgus 50% Intrauterine growth retardation 50% Mandibular prognathia 50% Melanocytic nevus 50% Microcephaly 50% Microcornea 50% Narrow chest 50% Narrow face 50% Narrow mouth 50% Seizures 50% Short nose 50% Short stature 50% Short toe 50% Spina bifida 50% Sprengel anomaly 50% Toe syndactyly 50% Underdeveloped supraorbital ridges 50% Blepharophimosis 7.5% Highly arched eyebrow 7.5% Long face 7.5% Low-set, posteriorly rotated ears 7.5% Sacral dimple 7.5% Short distal phalanx of finger 7.5% Synophrys 7.5% Abnormality of dental eruption - Absent ethmoidal sinuses - Absent frontal sinuses - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Bifid uvula - Brachycephaly - Camptodactyly of 2nd-5th fingers - Fibular hypoplasia - Flat face - High palate - Horizontal sacrum - Hypertelorism - Hypoplasia of midface - Hypoplastic 5th lumbar vertebrae - Hypoplastic iliac wing - Intellectual disability - Long neck - Low-set ears - Lumbar hyperlordosis - Microtia - Overfolding of the superior helices - Posteriorly rotated ears - Scapular winging - Short femoral neck - Short foot - Short metatarsal - Short palm - Short palpebral fissure - Small earlobe - Spina bifida occulta - Tubular metacarpal bones - Twelfth rib hypoplasia - Upslanted palpebral fissure - Wormian bones - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.']}"}, "time": 1746283459.9720168}
