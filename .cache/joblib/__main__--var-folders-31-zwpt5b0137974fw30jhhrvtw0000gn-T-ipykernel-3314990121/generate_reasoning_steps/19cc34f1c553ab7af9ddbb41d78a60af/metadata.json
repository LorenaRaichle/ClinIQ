It infects the genital area, lips, mouth, or anus of both men and women. You usually get syphilis from sexual contact with someone who has it. It can also pass from mother to baby during pregnancy.    The early stage of syphilis usually causes a single, small, painless sore. Sometimes it causes swelling in nearby lymph nodes. If you do not treat it, syphilis usually causes a non-itchy skin rash, often on your hands and feet. Many people do not notice symptoms for years. Symptoms can go away and come back.    The sores caused by syphilis make it easier to get or give someone HIV during sex. If you are pregnant, syphilis can cause birth defects, or you could lose your baby. In rare cases, syphilis causes serious health problems and even death.    Syphilis is easy to cure with antibiotics if you catch it early. Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading syphilis.

Actually, your tears clean your eyes every time you blink. Tears also keep your eyes moist, which is important for your vision.    Tear glands produce tears, and tear ducts carry the tears from the glands to the surface of your eye. Problems with the tear system can include too many tears, too few tears, or problems with the tear ducts. Treatment of the problem depends on the cause.', \"Summary : Palliative care is treatment of the discomfort, symptoms, and stress of serious illness. It provides relief from distressing symptoms including       - Pain    - Shortness of breath    - Fatigue    - Constipation    - Nausea    - Loss of appetite    - Problems with sleep       It can also help you deal with the side effects of the medical treatments you're receiving.    Hospice care, care at the end of life, always includes palliative care. But you may receive palliative care at any stage of an illness. The goal is to make you comfortable and improve your quality of life.    NIH: National Institute of Nursing Research\"]}"}, "time": 1746283467.48159}
