Treatment for Liddle syndrome includes following a low sodium diet as well as taking potassium-sparing diuretics, which reduce blood pressure and correct hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Conventional anti-hypertensive therapies are not effective for this condition. With treatment, prognosis is good. Without treatment, cardiovascular (heart-related) and renal (kidney-related) complications often occur.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Cobb syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Cobb syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Arteriovenous malformation 90% Arthralgia 90% Bone pain 90% Hemiplegia/hemiparesis 90% Hyperreflexia 90% Lymphangioma 90% Morphological abnormality of the central nervous system 90% Visceral angiomatosis 90% Hyperkeratosis 50% Multiple lipomas 50% Abnormality of the urinary system 7.5% Congestive heart failure 7.5% Gangrene 7.5% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Gupta Patton syndrome?

Facial features may include a long, narrow face; a high forehead; flushed (reddened) cheeks; a small, pointed chin; and down-slanting palpebral fissures. Affected infants and children tend to grow quickly; they are significantly taller than their siblings and peers and have a large head. Other signs and symptoms may include intellectual disability; behavioral problems; problems with speech and language; and/or weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Sotos syndrome is usually caused by a mutation in the NSD1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. About 95% of cases are due to a new mutation in the affected person and occur sporadically (are not inherited).']}"}, "time": 1746283457.546678}
