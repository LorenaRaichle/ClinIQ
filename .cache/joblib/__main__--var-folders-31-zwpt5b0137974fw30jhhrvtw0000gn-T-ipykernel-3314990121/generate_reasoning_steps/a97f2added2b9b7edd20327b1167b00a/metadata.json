Neck pain is very common. Pain may also come from your shoulder, jaw, head, or upper arms.     Muscle strain or tension often causes neck pain. The problem is usually overuse, such as from sitting at a computer for too long. Sometimes you can strain your neck muscles from sleeping in an awkward position or overdoing it during exercise. Falls or accidents, including car accidents, are another common cause of neck pain. Whiplash, a soft tissue injury to the neck, is also called neck sprain or strain.    Treatment depends on the cause, but may include applying ice, taking pain relievers, getting physical therapy or wearing a cervical collar. You rarely need surgery.', 'Fourteen of the 26 bones in your feet are in your toes. The toes, particularly your big toe, help you move and keep your balance. Playing sports, running, and receiving a blow to the foot can damage your toes. Wearing shoes that are too loose or too tight can also cause toe problems. Certain diseases, such as severe arthritis, can cause toe problems and pain. Gout often causes pain in the big toe.    Common toe problems include        -  Corns and bunions    -  Ingrown toenails    -  Toe joint sprains and dislocations    -  Fractured toe bones       Treatments for toe injuries and disorders vary. They might include shoe inserts or special shoes, padding, taping, medicines, rest, and in severe cases, surgery.', 'A brain tumor is a growth of abnormal cells in the tissues of the brain. Brain tumors can be benign, with no cancer cells, or malignant, with cancer cells that grow quickly. Some are primary brain tumors, which start in the brain. Others are metastatic, and they start somewhere else in the body and move to the brain.    Brain tumors can cause many symptoms. Some of the most common are       - Headaches, often in the morning     - Nausea and vomiting    - Changes in your ability to talk, hear, or see    - Problems with balance or walking    - Problems with thinking or memory     - Feeling weak or sleepy    - Changes in your mood or behavior    - Seizures       Doctors diagnose brain tumors by doing a neurologic exam and tests including an MRI, CT scan, and biopsy. Treatment options include watchful waiting, surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells. Many people get a combination of treatments.    NIH: National Cancer Institute', 'The bronchi are two tubes that branch off the trachea, or windpipe. The bronchi carry air to your lungs.    The most common problem with the bronchi is bronchitis, an inflammation of the tubes. Bronchitis can be acute or chronic. Other problems include       - Bronchiectasis, a condition in which damage to the airways causes them to widen and become flabby and scarred    - Exercise-induced bronchospasm, which happens when the airways shrink while you are exercising    - Bronchiolitis, an inflammation of the small airways that branch off from the bronchi    - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a condition affecting infants       Treatment of bronchial disorders depends on the cause.']}"}, "time": 1746283467.476696}
