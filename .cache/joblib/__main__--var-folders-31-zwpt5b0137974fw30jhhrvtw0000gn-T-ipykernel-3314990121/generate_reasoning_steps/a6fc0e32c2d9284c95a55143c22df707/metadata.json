Amniotic bands are caused by damage to a part of the placenta called the amnion. Damage to the amnion may produce fiber-like bands that can trap parts of the developing baby.', 'How is amniotic band syndrome diagnosed? The earliest reported detection of an amniotic band is at 12 weeks gestation, by vaginal ultrasound. On ultrasound the bands appear as thin, mobile lines, which may be seen attached to or around the baby. However these bands may be difficult to detect by ultrasound, and are more often diagnosed by the results of the fusion, such as missing or deformed limbs.', 'How might amniotic band syndrome be treated? Mild cases may not require treatment, however all bands need monitoring as growth occurs to watch for progressive constriction and swelling. Other constrictions may require surgical management; surgical options will vary depending on the abnormality. People with amniotic band syndrome who have amputations may benefit from the use of prosthetics.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Mental retardation, macrocephaly, short stature and craniofacial dysmorphism? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Mental retardation, macrocephaly, short stature and craniofacial dysmorphism. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Astigmatism 5% Myopia 5% Patellar subluxation 5% Psychosis 5% Abnormality of the musculature - Adrenal medullary hypoplasia - Broad forehead - Coarse facial features - Delayed speech and language development - Dolichocephaly - Intellectual disability - Macrocephaly - Mandibular prognathia - Megalencephaly - Optic atrophy - Pointed chin - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.']}"}, "time": 1746283458.626295}
