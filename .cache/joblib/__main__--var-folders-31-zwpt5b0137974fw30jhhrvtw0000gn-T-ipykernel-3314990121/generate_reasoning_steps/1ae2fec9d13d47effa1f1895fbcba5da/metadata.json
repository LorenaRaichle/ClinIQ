The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Brachydactyly Mononen type. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Micromelia 90% Short distal phalanx of finger 90% Short hallux 90% Synostosis of carpal bones 90% Tarsal synostosis 90% Abnormal dermatoglyphics 50% Abnormality of epiphysis morphology 50% Abnormality of the fingernails 50% Abnormality of the metaphyses 50% Brachydactyly syndrome 50% Clinodactyly of the 5th finger 50% Exostoses 50% Short stature 50% Symphalangism affecting the phalanges of the hand 50% Hernia of the abdominal wall 7.5% Absent distal phalanx of the 2nd toe - Aplasia of the distal phalanx of the 2nd finger - Mild short stature - Proximal fibular overgrowth - Short 1st metacarpal - Short first metatarsal - Synostosis of carpals/tarsals - X-linked dominant inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Urachal cyst is a sac-like pocket of tissue that develops in the urachus, a primitive structure that connects the umbilical cord to the bladder in the developing baby. Although it normally disappears prior to birth, part of the urachus may remain in some people. Urachal cysts can develop at any age, but typically affect older children and adults. Urachal cysts are often not associated with any signs or symptoms unless there are complications such as infection. In these cases, symptoms may include abdominal pain, fever, pain with urination and/or hematuria. Treatment typically includes surgery to drain the cyst and/or remove the urachus.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of a urachal cyst? In most cases, urachal cysts are not associated with any signs or symptoms unless there are complications such as infection. Possible symptoms vary, but may include: Lower abdominal pain Fever Abdominal lump or mass Pain with urination Urinary tract infection Hematuria', 'What causes a urachal cyst? A urachal cyst occurs when a pocket of air or fluid develops in the urachus. Before birth, the urachus is a primitive structure that connects the umbilical cord to the bladder in the developing baby. The urachus normally disappears before birth, but part of the urachus may remain in some people after they are born. This can lead to urachal abnormalities such as urachal cysts.']}"}, "time": 1746283461.6540842}
