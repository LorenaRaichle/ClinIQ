These genes provide instructions for making proteins that help destroy or deactivate lymphocytes that are no longer needed. By controlling the number of activated lymphocytes, these genes help regulate immune system function.  Approximately 40 to 60 percent of cases of familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis are caused by mutations in the PRF1 or UNC13D genes. Smaller numbers of cases are caused by mutations in other known genes. In some affected individuals, the genetic cause of the disorder is unknown.  The gene mutations that cause familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis impair the body's ability to regulate the immune system. These changes result in the exaggerated immune response characteristic of this condition.\", 'This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.', 'These resources address the diagnosis or management of familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis:  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis, Familial  - Genetic Testing Registry: Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis  - Genetic Testing Registry: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, familial, 2  - Genetic Testing Registry: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, familial, 3  - Genetic Testing Registry: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, familial, 4  - Genetic Testing Registry: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, familial, 5  - The Merck Manual for Healthcare Professionals  - University of Minnesota: Pediatric Blood & Marrow Transplantation Center   These resources from MedlinePlus offer information about the diagnosis and management of various health conditions:  - Diagnostic Tests  - Drug Therapy  - Surgery and Rehabilitation  - Genetic Counseling   - Palliative Care']}"}, "time": 1746283454.088604}
