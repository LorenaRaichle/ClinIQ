Recommendations for management of children with achondroplasia were outlined by the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Genetics in the article, Health Supervision for Children with Achondroplasia. We recommend that you review this article with your childs health care provider(s). These recommendations include:  Monitoring of height, weight, and head circumference using growth curves standardized for achondroplasia  Measures to avoid obesity starting in early childhood.  Careful neurologic examinations, with referral to a pediatric neurologist as necessary  MRI or CT of the foramen magnum region for evaluation of severe hypotonia or signs of spinal cord compression  Obtaining history for possible sleep apnea, with sleep studies as necessary  Evaluation for low thoracic or high lumbar gibbus if truncal weakness is present  Referral to a pediatric orthopedist if bowing of the legs interferes with walking  Management of frequent middle-ear infections  Speech evaluation by age two years  Careful monitoring of social adjustment The GeneReview article on achondroplasia also provides information on medical management.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1152/#achondroplasia.Management', 'Bilateral generalized polymicrogyria is a rare neurological disorder that affects the cerebral cortex (the outer surface of the brain). This is the most widespread form of polymicrogyria and typically affects the entire surface of the brain. Signs and symptoms include severe intellectual disability, problems with movement, and seizures that are difficult or impossible to treat. While the exact cause of bilateral generalized polymicrogyria is not fully understood, it is thought to be due to improper brain development during embryonic growth. Most cases appear to follow an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Epilepsy occipital calcifications? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Epilepsy occipital calcifications. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of metabolism/homeostasis 90% Abnormality of the cerebral vasculature 90% Anemia 90% Cerebral calcification 90% Malabsorption 90% Seizures 90% Visual impairment 90% Cognitive impairment 7.5% Celiac disease - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Steatocystoma multiplex is a condition characterized by numerous skin cysts that tend to develop during puberty. Cysts most often develop on the chest, upper arms and face, but may develop all over the body in some cases. The cysts may become inflamed and cause scarring when they heal. The condition is thought to be caused by mutations in the KRT17 gene and appears to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Some researchers have suggested that the condition may be a mild variant of pachyonychia congenita type 2. Treatment may include minor surgery to remove cysts and oral antibiotics or oral isotretinoin to reduce inflammation.']}"}, "time": 1746283459.659167}
