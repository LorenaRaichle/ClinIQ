Pycnodysostosis is an autosomal recessive genetic condition.  The gene has been mapped to the same location as the gene for cathepsin K on chromosome 1q21.  The diagnosis of pycnodysostosis is based on physical features and X-ray findings.  Molecular genetic testing is available.  Management is symptomatic.  Individuals need orthopedic monitoring, treatment of fractures, appropriate dental care, and craniofacial surgery may be needed.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Pycnodysostosis? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Pycnodysostosis. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of epiphysis morphology 90% Abnormality of the clavicle 90% Abnormality of the fingernails 90% Abnormality of the palate 90% Brachydactyly syndrome 90% Delayed eruption of teeth 90% Frontal bossing 90% High forehead 90% Malar flattening 90% Osteolysis 90% Recurrent fractures 90% Short distal phalanx of finger 90% Short stature 90% Short toe 90% Skeletal dysplasia 90% Abnormality of dental morphology 50% Anonychia 50% Blue sclerae 50% Bone pain 50% Proptosis 50% Wormian bones 50% Abnormal pattern of respiration 7.5% Abnormality of pelvic girdle bone morphology 7.5% Anemia 7.5% Cognitive impairment 7.5% Hepatomegaly 7.5% Hydrocephalus 7.5% Hyperlordosis 7.5% Kyphosis 7.5% Narrow chest 7.5% Osteomyelitis 7.5% Splenomegaly 7.5% Abnormality of the thorax - Absent frontal sinuses - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Carious teeth - Delayed eruption of permanent teeth - Delayed eruption of primary teeth - Hypodontia - Increased bone mineral density - Narrow palate - Osteolytic defects of the distal phalanges of the hand - Persistence of primary teeth - Persistent open anterior fontanelle - Prominent nose - Prominent occiput - Ridged nail - Scoliosis - Spondylolisthesis - Spondylolysis - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Dandy-Walker malformation with facial hemangioma?

With pachygyria, there are few gyri (the ridges between the wrinkles in the brain), and they are usually broad and flat. The condition is also known as \"incomplete lissencephaly.\" Pachygyria may occur alone (isolated) or as part of various underlying syndromes. Symptoms vary among affected people and may include moderate to severe developmental delay, seizures, poor muscle tone and control, feeding or swallowing difficulties, and small head size (microcephaly). In most cases it is not inherited, but various inheritance patterns have been reported. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.']}"}, "time": 1746283460.738134}
