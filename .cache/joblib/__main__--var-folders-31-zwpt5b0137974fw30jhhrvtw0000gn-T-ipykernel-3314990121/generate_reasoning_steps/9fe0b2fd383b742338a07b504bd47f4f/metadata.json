The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Centronuclear myopathy. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) EMG abnormality 90% Gait disturbance 90% Muscular hypotonia 90% Skeletal muscle atrophy 90% Arrhythmia 50% Mask-like facies 50% Ophthalmoparesis 50% Ptosis 50% Respiratory insufficiency 50% Scoliosis 50% Seizures 50% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Linear porokeratosis is a skin condition that most often begins in infancy or early childhood, but it can occur at any age.  The main feature of this condition is the development of reddish brown, slightly raised markings on the skin arranged in lines or streaks on one side of the body.  These markings are not usually painful, though they can sometimes cause open sores in the skin.  There is up to an 11% chance that these markings could progress to skin cancer (basal cell cancer or squamous cell carcinoma) over time.  The exact cause of linear porokeratosis is unknown, but risk factors may include exposure to the sun or radiation, problems with the immune system (immunosuppression), or genetic predisposition.', 'How might linear porokeratosis be treated? Because linear porokeratosis is a rare condition, there is no established treatment protocol.  Protection from sun exposure and regular visits to a doctor to check for skin cancer are encouraged as routine care.  Treatment options depend on the size, location, and severity of the characteristic skin markings.  Several medications (5-fluorouracil, acitretin) have been shown to be effective for treating this condition in a small number of patients.  We identified a single report of photodynamic therapy being used to successfully treat an individual with linear porokeratosis.  Surgery is recommended to remove any skin cancer that may develop.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Ramos Arroyo Clark syndrome?
