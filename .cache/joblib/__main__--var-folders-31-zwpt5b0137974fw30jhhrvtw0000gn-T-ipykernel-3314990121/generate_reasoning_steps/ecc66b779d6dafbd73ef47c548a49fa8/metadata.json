Saliva makes your food moist, which helps you chew and swallow. It helps you digest your food. It also cleans your mouth and contains antibodies that can kill germs.     Problems with salivary glands can cause the glands to become irritated and swollen. This causes symptoms such as        -  Bad taste in the mouth    -  Difficulty opening your mouth     -  Dry mouth    -  Pain in the face or mouth    -  Swelling of the face or neck       Causes of salivary gland problems include infections, obstruction or cancer. Problems can also be due to other disorders, such as mumps or Sjogren's syndrome.\", \"Bronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchial tubes, the airways that carry air to your lungs. It causes a cough that often brings up mucus. It can also cause shortness of breath, wheezing, a low fever, and chest tightness. There are two main types of bronchitis: acute and chronic.    Most cases of acute bronchitis get better within several days. But your cough can last for several weeks after the infection is gone.    The same viruses that cause colds and the flu often cause acute bronchitis. These viruses spread through the air when people cough, or though physical contact (for example, on unwashed hands). Being exposed to tobacco smoke, air pollution, dusts, vapors, and fumes can also cause acute bronchitis. Less often, bacteria can also cause acute bronchitis.    To diagnose acute bronchitis, your health care provider will ask about your symptoms and listen to your breathing. You may also have other tests.    Treatments include rest, fluids, and aspirin (for adults) or acetaminophen to treat fever. A humidifier or steam can also help. You may need inhaled medicine to open your airways if you are wheezing. Antibiotics won't help if the cause is viral. You may get antibiotics if the cause is bacterial.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\", 'Summary : If you are like many Americans, you drink alcohol at least occasionally. For many people, moderate drinking is probably safe. It may even have health benefits, including reducing your risk of certain heart problems. For most women and for most people over 65, moderate drinking is no more than three drinks a day or seven drinks per week. For men under 65, it is no more than four drinks a day or 14 drinks per week.    Some people should not drink at all, including alcoholics, children, pregnant women, people taking certain medicines, and people with certain medical conditions. If you have questions about whether it is safe for you to drink, speak with your health care provider.    Anything more than moderate drinking can be risky. Heavy drinking can lead to alcoholism and alcohol abuse, as well as injuries, liver disease, heart disease, cancer, and other health problems. It can also cause problems at home, at work, and with friends.    NIH: National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'If you take a medicine in a way that is different from what the doctor prescribed, it is called prescription drug abuse. It could be       - Taking a medicine that was prescribed for someone else    - Taking a larger dose than you are supposed to    - Taking the medicine in a different way than you are supposed to. This might be crushing tablets and then snorting or injecting them.    - Using the medicine for another purpose, such as getting high       Abusing some prescription drugs can lead to addiction. These include narcotic painkillers, sedatives, tranquilizers, and stimulants.    Every medicine has some risk of side effects. Doctors take this into account when prescribing medicines. People who abuse these drugs may not understand the risks. The medicines may not be safe for them, especially at higher doses or when taken with other medicines.
