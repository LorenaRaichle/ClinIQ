It includes two kidneys, two ureters, a bladder, and a urethra. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the second most common type of infection in the body.    You may have a UTI if you notice       - Pain or burning when you urinate    - Fever, tiredness, or shakiness    - An urge to urinate often    - Pressure in your lower belly     - Urine that smells bad or looks cloudy or reddish    - Pain in your back or side below the ribs       People of any age or sex can get UTIs. But about four times as many women get UTIs as men. You're also at higher risk if you have diabetes, need a tube to drain your bladder, or have a spinal cord injury.    If you think you have a UTI it is important to see your doctor. Your doctor can tell if you have a UTI with a urine test. Treatment is with antibiotics.     NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\", 'Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare, inherited disease. It affects the nervous system, immune system, and other body systems. Symptoms appear in young children, usually before age 5. They include       - Ataxia - trouble coordinating movements    - Poor balance     - Slurred speech    - Tiny, red spider veins, called telangiectasias, on the skin and eyes    - Lung infections    - Delayed physical and sexual development       People with A-T have an increased risk of developing diabetes and cancers, especially lymphoma and leukemia. Although it affects the brain, people with A-T usually have normal or high intelligence.    A-T has no cure. Treatments might improve some symptoms. They include injections to strengthen the immune system, physical and speech therapy, and high-dose vitamins.     NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'The pericardium is a membrane, or sac, that surrounds your heart. It holds the heart in place and helps it work properly. Problems with the pericardium include       - Pericarditis - an inflammation of the sac. It can be from a virus or other infection, a heart attack, heart surgery, other medical conditions, injuries, and certain medicines.    - Pericardial effusion - the buildup of fluid in the sac    - Cardiac tamponade - a serious problem in which buildup of fluid in the sac causes problems with the function of the heart       Symptoms of pericardial problems include chest pain, rapid heartbeat, and difficulty breathing. Fever is a common symptom of acute pericarditis. Your doctor may use a physical exam, imaging tests, and heart tests to make a diagnosis. Treatment depends on the cause.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Your pituitary gland is a pea-sized gland at the base of your brain. The pituitary is the \"master control gland\" - it makes hormones that affect growth and the functions of other glands in the body.     With pituitary disorders, you often have too much or too little of one of your hormones. Injuries can cause pituitary disorders, but the most common cause is a pituitary tumor.']}"}, "time": 1746283467.116589}
