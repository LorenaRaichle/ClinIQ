Valinemia is thought to be extremely rare and has been described in only a few people. The condition is reportedly present from birth. Symptoms in the newborn period include lack of appetite, protein intolerance, metabolic acidosis, frequent vomiting, failure to thrive, and/or coma. The condition can become life-threatening. Abnormally low muscle tone (hypotonia); hyperkinesia; hyperactivity; excessive drowsiness; and delayed mental and physical development have also been reported. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Valinemia. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal recessive inheritance - Drowsiness - Failure to thrive - Hyperkinesis - Hypervalinemia - Muscle weakness - Vomiting - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'How might valinemia be treated? Due to the rarity of valinemia, information about treatment in the medical literature is very limited. A diet low in valine introduced during early infancy is thought to improve symptoms of the condition and lower valine concentrations in the blood to normal levels.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Irons Bhan syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Irons Bhan syndrome.

In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Sialadenitis is an infection of the salivary glands. It is usually caused by a virus or bacteria. The parotid (in front of the ear) and submandibular (under the chin) glands are most commonly affected. Sialadenitis may be associated with pain, tenderness, redness, and gradual, localized swelling of the affected area. There are both acute and chronic forms. Although it is quite common among elderly adults with salivary gland stones, sialadenitis can also occur in other age groups, including infants during the first few weeks of life. Without proper treatment, sialadenitis can develop into a severe infection, especially in people who are debilitated or elderly.']}"}, "time": 1746283461.2321851}
