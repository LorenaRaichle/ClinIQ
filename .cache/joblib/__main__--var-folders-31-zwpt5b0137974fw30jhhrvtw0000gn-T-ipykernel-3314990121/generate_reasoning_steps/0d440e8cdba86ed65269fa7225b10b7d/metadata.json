Symptoms of SCOT deficiency include ketoacidosis crises that are often brought on by physical stress, fasting, or illness. Between crises, patients have no symptoms. Normal growth and development are expected under proper treatment which prevents the occurrence of severe ketoacidotic attacks. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for SCOT deficiency. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal recessive inheritance - Episodic ketoacidosis - Ketonuria - Tachypnea - Vomiting - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'How is SCOT deficiency diagnosed? Diagnosis of SCOT deficiency is made in people showing the signs and symptoms of the condition and who have absent or reduced SCOT enzyme activity.', 'How might carnitine palmitoyltransferase I deficiency be treated?  Treatment of hypoketotic hypoglycemic attacks due to carnitine palmitoyltransferase I deficiency often involves prompt treatment with intravenous 10% dextrose.', 'Osteochondritis dissecans is a joint condition that occurs when a piece of cartilage and the thin layer of bone beneath it, separates from the end of the bone. If the piece of cartilage and bone remain close to where they detached, they may not cause any symptoms. However, affected people may experience pain, weakness and/or decreased range of motion in the affected joint if the cartilage and bone travel into the joint space. Although osteochondritis dissecans can affect people of all ages, it is most commonly diagnosed in people between the ages of 10 and 20 years. In most cases, the exact underlying cause is unknown. Rarely, the condition can affect more than one family member (called familial osteochondritis dissecans); in these cases, osteochondritis dissecans is caused by changes (mutations) in the ACAN gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Treatment for the condition varies depending on many factors, including the age of the affected person and the severity of the symptoms, but may include rest; casting or splinting; surgery and/or physical therapy.']}"}, "time": 1746283457.309458}
