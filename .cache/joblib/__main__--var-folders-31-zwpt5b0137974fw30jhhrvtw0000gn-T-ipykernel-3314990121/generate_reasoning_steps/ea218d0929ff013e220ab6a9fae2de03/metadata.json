This condition occurs when the enzyme that normally converts bilirubin into a form that can easily be removed from the body does not work correctly. Without this enzyme, bilirubin can build up in the body and lead to jaundice and damage to the brain, muscles, and nerves. Crigler Najjar syndrome, type 1 is caused by mutations in the UGT1A1 gene. The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment relies on regular phototherapy throughout life. Blood transfusions and calcium compounds have also been used. Liver transplantation may be considered in some individuals.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Crigler Najjar syndrome, type 1? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Crigler Najjar syndrome, type 1. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the liver 90% Hearing impairment 7.5% Memory impairment 7.5% Ophthalmoparesis 7.5% Seizures 7.5% Autosomal recessive inheritance - Encephalopathy - Jaundice - Kernicterus - Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Fetal hydantoin syndrome is a disorder that is caused by exposure of a fetus to phenytoin, a drug commonly prescribed for epilepsy. Not all infants exposed to phenytoin will be affected with the disorder. Symptoms in affected individuals may include abnormalities of the skull and facial features, growth deficiencies, underdeveloped nails of the fingers and toes, and/or mild developmental delays. Other findings occasionally associated with this syndrome include cleft lip and palate, having an abnormally small head (microcephaly) and brain malformations with more significant developmental delays. Treatment may include surgery for cleft lip and palate and special education and related services for children with learning delays. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Fetal hydantoin syndrome? There is a wide range in the nature and severity of characteristics associated with fetal hydantoin syndrome. Of infants born to women who used phenytoin during pregnancy, 10-30% are reported to show some of the characteristics associated with this syndrome. Few infants exposed only to phenytoin have all of the characteristic that have been reported. Children with this condition may be small at birth, with increased hair on the body and face, and with poorly developed fingernails and toenails. They may also have poor muscle tone. Facial features that may be present with this syndrome include a flat bridge of the nose; an underdeveloped vertical groove in the center of the upper lip (philtrum); a large mouth; and malformed ears. Features specific to the eyes may include down-slanted eyes; widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism); crossed eyes (strabismus); drooping eyelids (ptosis); and/or epicanthal folds (skin folds of the eyelid covering the inner corner of the eye). Other features that have been reported include a short or webbed neck and low-set hair line. Growth deficiencies may include underdeveloped fingers and/or toes, malformed nails, as well as finger-like thumbs. These features are often associated with growth delay and varying degrees of developmental delay. The risk for an affected child to be neurologically impaired is estimated at 1 to 11 % (two to three times higher than for the general population). The risk of cleft lip and/or palate and heart defects is estimated to be about five times higher among exposed infants. Some case reports have suggested an increased risk for the occurrence of benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous) tumors, such as neuroblastoma or other neonatal tumors (ependymoma, ectodermal tumors, Wilms tumor).
