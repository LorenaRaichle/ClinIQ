More severe hyperthyroidism is treated with antithyroid medications, which act by interfering with thyroid hormone production.  - Uncontrolled hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to serious health problems in the mother and can affect the unborn babys growth and brain development.  - Hypothyroidism during pregnancy is treated with synthetic thyroid hormone, thyroxine (T4).  - Postpartum thyroiditisinflammation of the thyroid glandcauses a brief period of hyperthyroidism, often followed by hypothyroidism that usually goes away within a year.

The bladder, located in the pelvis between the pelvic bones, is a hollow, muscular, balloon-shaped organ that expands as it fills with urine. During urination, also called voiding, the bladder empties through the urethra, located at the bottom of the bladder. The urethra is the tube that carries urine outside of the body. The vagina is the tube in a womans body that runs beside the urethra and connects the womb, or uterus, to the outside of the body.']}"}, "time": 1746283484.419401}
