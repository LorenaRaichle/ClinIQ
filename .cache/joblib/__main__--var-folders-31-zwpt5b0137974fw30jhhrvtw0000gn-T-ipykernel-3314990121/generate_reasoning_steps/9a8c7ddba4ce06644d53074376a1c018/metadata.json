You usually get it by breathing in mist from water that contains the bacteria. The mist may come from hot tubs, showers, or air-conditioning units for large buildings. The bacteria don't spread from person to person.    Symptoms of Legionnaires' disease include high fever, chills, a cough, and sometimes muscle aches and headaches. Other types of pneumonia have similar symptoms. You will probably need a chest x-ray to diagnose the pneumonia. Lab tests can detect the specific bacteria that cause Legionnaires' disease.     Most people exposed to the bacteria do not become sick. You are more likely to get sick if you       - Are older than 50    - Smoke    - Have a chronic lung disease    - Have a weak immune system       Legionnaires' disease is serious and can be life-threatening. However, most people recover with antibiotic treatment.     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\", 'Summary : No matter how well you have prepared, you might feel dazed or numb after going through a disaster. You may also feel sad, helpless, or anxious. In spite of the tragedy, you might just feel happy to be alive.    It is not unusual to have bad memories or dreams. You may avoid places or people that remind you of the disaster. You might have trouble sleeping, eating, or paying attention. Many people have short tempers and get angry easily. These are all normal reactions to stress.    Sometimes the stress can be too much to handle alone. Some people have long-term problems after a disaster, including       -  Post-traumatic stress disorder    -  Depression    -  Self-blame    -  Suicidal thoughts    -  Alcohol or drug abuse       If your emotional reactions are getting in the way of your relationships, work, or other important activities, talk to a counselor or your doctor. Treatments are available.    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Summary : Cloning describes the processes used to create an exact genetic replica of another cell, tissue or organism. The copied material, which has the same genetic makeup as the original, is referred to as a clone. The most famous clone was a Scottish sheep named Dolly.    There are three different types of cloning:       - Gene cloning, which creates copies of genes or segments of DNA    - Reproductive cloning, which creates copies of whole animals    - Therapeutic cloning, which creates embryonic stem cells. Researchers hope to use these cells to grow healthy tissue to replace injured or diseased tissues in the human body.       NIH: National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Measles is an infectious disease caused by a virus. It spreads easily from person to person. It causes a blotchy red rash. The rash often starts on the head and moves down the body. Other symptoms include       - Fever    - Cough    - Runny nose    - Conjunctivitis (pink eye)    - Feeling achy and run down    - Tiny white spots inside the mouth       Sometimes measles can lead to serious problems. There is no treatment for measles, but the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine can prevent it.    \"German measles\", also known as rubella, is a completely different illness.
