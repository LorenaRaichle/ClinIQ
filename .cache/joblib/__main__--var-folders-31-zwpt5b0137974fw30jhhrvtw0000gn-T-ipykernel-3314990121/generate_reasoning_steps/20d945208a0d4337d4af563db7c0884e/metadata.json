However, studies have shown that the early detection and treatment of glaucoma, before it causes major vision loss, is the best way to control the disease. So, if you fall into one of the higher risk groups for the disease, make sure to have a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least once every one to two years.  Get tips on finding an eye care professional. Learn what a comprehensive dilated eye exam involves.', 'At first, open-angle glaucoma has no symptoms. It causes no pain. Vision seems normal. Without treatment, people with glaucoma will slowly lose their peripheral, or side vision. They seem to be looking through a tunnel. Over time, straight-ahead vision may decrease until no vision remains.', \"Yes. Immediate treatment for early stage, open-angle glaucoma can delay progression of the disease. That's why early diagnosis is very important. Glaucoma treatments include medicines, laser surgery, conventional surgery, or a combination of any of these. While these treatments may save remaining vision, they do not improve sight already lost from glaucoma.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283468.8292968}
