Treatment will vary depending on whether the patient has a paraneoplastic form of limbic encephalitis or not.  If the patient has a viral infectious form of the condition, an antiviral drug may be prescribed.  When a tumor is found in association with a possible paraneoplastic disorder, removal of the tumor and immunotherapy may be offered.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Cataract, total congenital? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Cataract, total congenital. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Congenital nuclear cataract - Severe visual impairment - Sutural cataract - X-linked inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Genochondromatosis?
