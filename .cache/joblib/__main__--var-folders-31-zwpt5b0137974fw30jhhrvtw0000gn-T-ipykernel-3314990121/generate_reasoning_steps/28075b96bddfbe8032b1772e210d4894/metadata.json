It occurs in all age, racial, and ethnic groups. Both men and women can have anemia. However, women of childbearing age are at higher risk for the condition because of blood loss from menstruation.\\n                \\nAnemia can develop during pregnancy due to low levels of iron and folic acid (folate) and changes in the blood. During the first 6 months of pregnancy, the fluid portion of a woman's blood (the plasma) increases faster than the number of red blood cells. This dilutes the blood and can lead to anemia.\\n                \\nDuring the first year of life, some babies are at risk for anemia because of iron deficiency. At-risk infants include those who are born too early and infants who are fed breast milk only or formula that isn't fortified with iron. These infants can develop iron deficiency by 6 months of age.\\n                \\nInfants between 1 and 2 years of age also are at risk for anemia. They may not get enough iron in their diets, especially if they drink a lot of cow's milk. Cow's milk is low in the iron needed for growth.\\n                \\nDrinking too much cow's milk may keep an infant or toddler from eating enough iron-rich foods or absorbing enough iron from foods.\\n                \\nOlder adults also are at increased risk for anemia. Researchers continue to study how the condition affects older adults. Many of these people have other medical conditions as well.\\n                \\nMajor Risk Factors\\n                \\nFactors that raise your risk for anemia include:\\n                \\nA diet that is low in iron, vitamins, or minerals\\n                \\nBlood loss from surgery or an injury\\n                \\nLong-term or serious illnesses, such as kidney disease, cancer, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, HIV/AIDS, inflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn's disease), liver disease, heart failure, and thyroid disease\\n                \\nLong-term infections\\n                \\nA family history of inherited anemia, such as sickle cell anemia or thalassemia\", \"The most common symptom of anemia is fatigue (feeling tired or weak). If you have anemia, you may find it hard to find the energy to do normal activities.\\n                \\nOther signs and symptoms of anemia include:\\n                \\nShortness of breath\\n                \\nDizziness\\n                \\nHeadache\\n                \\nColdness in the hands and feet\\n                \\nPale skin\\n                \\nChest pain\\n                \\nThese signs and symptoms can occur because your heart has to work harder to pump oxygen-rich blood through your body.\\n                \\nMild to moderate anemia may cause very mild symptoms or none at all.\\n                \\nComplications of Anemia\\n                \\nSome people who have anemia may have arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs). Arrhythmias are problems with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. Over time, arrhythmias can damage your heart and possibly lead to heart failure.\\n                \\nAnemia also can damage other organs in your body because your blood can't get enough oxygen to them.\\n                \\nAnemia can weaken people who have cancer or HIV/AIDS. This can make their treatments not work as well.\\n                \\nAnemia also can cause many other health problems. People who have kidney disease and anemia are more likely to have heart problems. With some types of anemia, too little fluid intake or too much loss of fluid in the blood and body can occur. Severe loss of fluid can be life threatening.\", \"Your doctor will diagnose anemia based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and results from tests and procedures.\\n                \\nBecause anemia doesn't always cause symptoms, your doctor may find out you have it while checking for another condition.\\n                \\nMedical and Family Histories\\n                \\nYour doctor may ask whether you have any of the common signs or symptoms of anemia. He or she also may ask whether you've had an illness or condition that could cause anemia.\\n                \\nLet your doctor know about any medicines you take, what you typically eat (your diet), and whether you have family members who have anemia or a history of it.\\n                \\nPhysical Exam\\n                \\nYour doctor will do a physical exam to find out how severe your anemia is and to check for possible causes. He or she may:\\n                \\nListen to your heart for a rapid or irregular heartbeat\\n                \\nListen to your lungs for rapid or uneven breathing\\n                \\nFeel your abdomen to check the size of your liver and spleen\\n                \\nYour doctor also may do a pelvic or rectal exam to check for common sources of blood loss.\\n                \\nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\\n                \\nYou may have various blood tests and other tests or procedures to find out what type of anemia you have and how severe it is.\\n                \\nComplete Blood Count\\n                \\nOften, the first test used to diagnose anemia is a complete blood count (CBC). The CBC measures many parts of your blood.\\n                \\nThe test checks your hemoglobin and hematocrit (hee-MAT-oh-crit) levels. Hemoglobin is the iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body. Hematocrit is a measure of how much space red blood cells take up in your blood. A low level of hemoglobin or hematocrit is a sign of anemia.\\n                \\nThe normal range of these levels might be lower in certain racial and ethnic populations. Your doctor can explain your test results to you.\\n                \\nThe CBC also checks the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. Abnormal results might be a sign of anemia, another blood disorder, an infection, or another condition.\\n                \\nFinally, the CBC looks at mean corpuscular (kor-PUS-kyu-lar) volume (MCV). MCV is a measure of the average size of your red blood cells and a clue as to the cause of your anemia. In iron-deficiency anemia, for example, red blood cells usually are smaller than normal.\\n                \\nOther Tests and Procedures\\n                \\nIf the CBC results show that you have anemia, you may need other tests, such as:\\n                \\nHemoglobin electrophoresis (e-lek-tro-FOR-e-sis). This test looks at the different types of hemoglobin in your blood. The test can help diagnose the type of anemia you have.\\n                \\nA reticulocyte (re-TIK-u-lo-site) count. This test measures the number of young red blood cells in your blood. The test shows whether your bone marrow is making red blood cells at the correct rate.\\n                \\nTests for the level of iron in your blood and body. These tests include serum iron and serum ferritin tests. Transferrin level and total iron-binding capacity tests also measure iron levels.\\n                \\nBecause anemia has many causes, you also might be tested for conditions such as kidney failure, lead poisoning (in children), and vitamin deficiencies (lack of vitamins, such as B12 and folic acid).\\n                \\nIf your doctor thinks that you have anemia due to internal bleeding, he or she may suggest several tests to look for the source of the bleeding. A test to check the stool for blood might be done in your doctor's office or at home. Your doctor can give you a kit to help you get a sample at home. He or she will tell you to bring the sample back to the office or send it to a laboratory.\\n                \\nIf blood is found in the stool, you may have other tests to find the source of the bleeding. One such test is endoscopy (en-DOS-ko-pe). For this test, a tube with a tiny camera is used to view the lining of the digestive tract.\\n                \\nYour doctor also may want to do bone marrow tests. These tests show whether your bone marrow is healthy and making enough blood cells.\", \"Treatment for anemia depends on the type, cause, and severity of the condition. Treatments may include dietary changes or supplements, medicines, procedures, or surgery to treat blood loss.\\n                \\nGoals of Treatment\\n                \\nThe goal of treatment is to increase the amount of oxygen that your blood can carry. This is done by raising the red blood cell count and/or hemoglobin level. (Hemoglobin is the iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body.)\\n                \\nAnother goal is to treat the underlying cause of the anemia.\\n                \\nDietary Changes and Supplements\\n                \\nLow levels of vitamins or iron in the body can cause some types of anemia. These low levels might be the result of a poor diet or certain diseases or conditions.\\n                \\nTo raise your vitamin or iron level, your doctor may ask you to change your diet or take vitamin or iron supplements. Common vitamin supplements are vitamin B12 and folic acid (folate). Vitamin C sometimes is given to help the body absorb iron.\\n                \\nIron\\n                \\nYour body needs iron to make hemoglobin. Your body can more easily absorb iron from meats than from vegetables or other foods. To treat your anemia, your doctor may suggest eating more meatespecially red meat (such as beef or liver), as well as chicken, turkey, pork, fish, and shellfish.\\n                \\nNonmeat foods that are good sources of iron include:\\n                \\nSpinach and other dark green leafy vegetables\\n                \\nTofu\\n                \\nPeas; lentils; white, red, and baked beans; soybeans; and chickpeas\\n                \\nDried fruits, such as prunes, raisins, and apricots\\n                \\nPrune juice\\n                \\nIron-fortified cereals and breads\\n                \\nYou can look at the Nutrition Facts label on packaged foods to find out how much iron the items contain. The amount is given as a percentage of the total amount of iron you need every day.\\n                \\nIron also is available as a supplement. It's usually combined with multivitamins and other minerals that help your body absorb iron.\\n                \\nDoctors may recommend iron supplements for premature infants, infants and young children who drink a lot of cow's milk, and infants who are fed breast milk only or formula that isn't fortified with iron.\\n                \\nLarge amounts of iron can be harmful, so take iron supplements only as your doctor prescribes.\\n                \\nVitamin B12\\n                \\nLow levels of vitamin B12 can lead to pernicious anemia. This type of anemia often is treated with vitamin B12 supplements.\\n                \\nGood food sources of vitamin B12 include:\\n                \\nBreakfast cereals with added vitamin B12\\n                \\nMeats such as beef, liver, poultry, and fish\\n                \\nEggs and dairy products (such as milk, yogurt, and cheese)\\n                \\nFoods fortified with vitamin B12, such as soy-based beverages and vegetarian burgers\\n                \\nFolic Acid\\n                \\nFolic acid (folate) is a form of vitamin B that's found in foods. Your body needs folic acid to make and maintain new cells. Folic acid also is very important for pregnant women. It helps them avoid anemia and promotes healthy growth of the fetus.\\n                \\nGood sources of folic acid include:\\n                \\nBread, pasta, and rice with added folic acid\\n                \\nSpinach and other dark green leafy vegetables\\n                \\nBlack-eyed peas and dried beans\\n                \\nBeef liver\\n                \\nEggs\\n                \\nBananas, oranges, orange juice, and some other fruits and juices\\n                \\nVitamin C\\n                \\nVitamin C helps the body absorb iron. Good sources of vitamin C are vegetables and fruits, especially citrus fruits. Citrus fruits include oranges, grapefruits, tangerines, and similar fruits. Fresh and frozen fruits, vegetables, and juices usually have more vitaminC than canned ones.\\n                \\nIf you're taking medicines, ask your doctor or pharmacist whether you can eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice. This fruit can affect the strength of a few medicines and how well they work.\\n                \\nOther fruits rich in vitamin C include kiwi fruit, strawberries, and cantaloupes.\\n                \\nVegetables rich in vitamin C include broccoli, peppers, Brussels sprouts, tomatoes, cabbage, potatoes, and leafy green vegetables like turnip greens and spinach.\\n                \\nMedicines\\n                \\nYour doctor may prescribe medicines to help your body make more red blood cells or to treat an underlying cause of anemia. Some of these medicines include:\\n                \\nAntibiotics to treat infections.\\n                \\nHormones to treat heavy menstrual bleeding in teenaged and adult women.\\n                \\nA man-made version of erythropoietin to stimulate your body to make more red blood cells. This hormone has some risks. You and your doctor will decide whether the benefits of this treatment outweigh the risks.\\n                \\nMedicines to prevent the body's immune system from destroying its own red blood cells.\\n                \\nChelation (ke-LAY-shun) therapy for lead poisoning. Chelation therapy is used mainly in children. This is because children who have iron-deficiency anemia are at increased risk of lead poisoning.\\n                \\nProcedures\\n                \\nIf your anemia is severe, your doctor may recommend a medical procedure. Procedures include blood transfusions and blood and marrow stem cell transplants.\\n                \\nBlood Transfusion\\n                \\nA blood transfusion is a safe, common procedure in which blood is given to you through an intravenous (IV) line in one of your blood vessels. Transfusions require careful matching of donated blood with the recipient's blood.\\n                \\nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Blood Transfusion article.\\n                \\nBlood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant\\n                \\nA blood and marrow stem cell transplant replaces your faulty stem cells with healthy ones from another person (a donor). Stem cells are made in the bone marrow. They develop into red and white blood cells and platelets.\\n                \\nDuring the transplant, which is like a blood transfusion, you get donated stem cells through a tube placed in a vein in your chest. Once the stem cells are in your body, they travel to your bone marrow and begin making new blood cells.\\n                \\nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant article.\\n                \\nSurgery\\n                \\nIf you have serious or life-threatening bleeding that's causing anemia, you may need surgery. For example, you may need surgery to control ongoing bleeding due to a stomach ulcer or colon cancer.\\n                \\nIf your body is destroying red blood cells at a high rate, you may need to have your spleen removed. The spleen is an organ that removes wornout red blood cells from the body. An enlarged or diseased spleen may remove more red blood cells than normal, causing anemia.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283465.369853}
