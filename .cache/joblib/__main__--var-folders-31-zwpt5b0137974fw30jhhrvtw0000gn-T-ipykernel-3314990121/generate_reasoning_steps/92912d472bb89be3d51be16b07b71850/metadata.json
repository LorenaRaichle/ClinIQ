In ITP, the blood doesn't clot as it should. This is due to a low number of blood cell fragments called platelets (PLATE-lets) or thrombocytes (THROM-bo-sites).\\n                \\nPlatelets are made in your bone marrow along with other kinds of blood cells. They stick together (clot) to seal small cuts or breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nWithout enough platelets, bleeding can occur inside the body (internal bleeding) or underneath or from the skin (external bleeding).\\n                \\nPeople who have ITP often have purple bruises called purpura (PURR-purr-ah). These bruises appear on the skin or mucous membranes (for example, in the mouth). Bleeding from small blood vessels under the skin causes purpura.\\n                \\nPeople who have ITP also may have bleeding that causes tiny red or purple dots on the skin. These pinpoint-sized dots are called petechiae (peh-TEE-kee-ay). Petechiae may look like a rash.\\n                \\nPetechiae and Purpura\\n                \\n\\n                \\nPeople who have ITP also may have nosebleeds, bleeding from the gums during dental work, or other bleeding that's hard to stop. Women who have ITP may have menstrual bleeding that's heavier than normal.\\n                \\nA lot of bleeding can cause hematomas (he-mah-TO-mas). A hematoma is a collection of clotted or partially clotted blood under the skin. It looks or feels like a lump.\\n                \\nBleeding in the brain as a result of ITP is very rare, but can be life threatening if it occurs.\\n                \\nIn most cases, an autoimmune response is thought to cause ITP. Normally, your immune system helps your body fight off infections and diseases. But if you have ITP, your immune system attacks and destroys its own platelets. The reason why this happens isn't known.\\n                \\nITP can't be passed from one person to another.\\n                \\nTypes of Immune Thrombocytopenia\\n                \\nThe two types of ITP are acute (temporary or short-term) and chronic (long-lasting).\\n                \\nAcute ITP generally lasts less than 6 months. It mainly occurs in childrenboth boys and girlsand is the most common type of ITP. Acute ITP often occurs after a viral infection.\\n                \\nChronic ITP lasts 6 months or longer and mostly affects adults. However, some teenagers and children do get this type of ITP. Chronic ITP affects women two to three times more often than men.\\n                \\nTreatment depends on the severity of bleeding and the platelet count. In mild cases, treatment may not be needed.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nFor most children and adults, ITP isn't a serious or life-threatening condition.\\n                \\nAcute ITP in children often goes away on its own within a few weeks or months and doesn't return. In 80 percent of children who have ITP, the platelet count returns to normal within 6 to 12 months. Treatment may not be needed.\\n                \\nFor a small number of children, ITP doesn't go away on its own and may require further medical or surgical treatment.\\n                \\nChronic ITP varies from person to person and can last for many years. Even people who have severe forms of chronic ITP can live for decades. Most people who have chronic ITP can stop treatment at some point and maintain a safe platelet count.\", 'In most cases, an autoimmune response is thought to cause immune thrombocytopenia (ITP).\\n                \\nNormally, your immune system helps your body fight off infections and diseases. In ITP, however, your immune system attacks and destroys your body\\'s platelets by mistake. Why this happens isn\\'t known.\\n                \\nIn some people, ITP may be linked to viral or bacterial infections, such as HIV, hepatitis C, or H. pylori.\\n                \\nChildren who have acute (short-term) ITP often have had recent viral infections. These infections may \"trigger\" or set off the immune reaction that leads to ITP.', \"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a fairly common blood disorder. Both children and adults can develop ITP.\\n                \\nChildren usually have the acute (short-term) type of ITP. Acute ITP often develops after a viral infection.\\n                \\nAdults tend to have the chronic (long-lasting) type of ITP. Women are two to three times more likely than men to develop chronic ITP.\\n                \\nThe number of cases of ITP is rising because routine blood tests that can detect a low platelet count are being done more often.\\n                \\nITP can't be passed from one person to another.\", \"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) may not cause any signs or symptoms. However, ITP can cause bleeding inside the body (internal bleeding) or underneath or from the skin (external bleeding). Signs of bleeding may include:\\n                \\nBruising or purplish areas on the skin or mucous membranes (such as in the mouth). These bruises are called purpura. They're caused by bleeding under the skin, and they may occur for no known reason.\\n                \\nPinpoint red spots on the skin called petechiae.

This includes menstrual bleeding that's heavier than normal. Bleeding in the brain is rare, and its symptoms may vary.\\n                \\nA low platelet count doesn't directly cause pain, problems concentrating, or other symptoms. However, a low platelet count might be associated with fatigue (tiredness).\"]}"}, "time": 1746283466.254148}
