The specific symptoms and severity of the disorder may vary greatly from one individual to another. CDPX2 is caused by mutations in the emopamil binding protein gene, EBP. In many cases, this mutation occurs randomly, for no apparent reason (i.e., new mutation). The condition  is inherited as an X-linked dominant trait and occurs almost exclusively in females. Treatment of CDPX2 is directed toward the specific symptoms that present in each individual. Such treatment may require the coordinated efforts of a team of medical professionals, including physicians who diagnose and treat disorders of the skeleton, joints, muscles, and related tissues (orthopedists); skin specialists (dermatologists); eye specialists; and/or other health care professionals.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Chondrodysplasia punctata 2 X-linked dominant? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Chondrodysplasia punctata 2 X-linked dominant. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Microcephaly pontocerebellar hypoplasia dyskinesia?
