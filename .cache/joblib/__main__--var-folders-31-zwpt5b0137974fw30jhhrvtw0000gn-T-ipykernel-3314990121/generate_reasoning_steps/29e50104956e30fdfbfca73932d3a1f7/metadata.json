More than one factor may play a role in causing the disease.\\n                \\nSome researchers think that sarcoidosis develops if your immune system responds to a trigger, such as bacteria, viruses, dust, or chemicals.\\n                \\nNormally, your immune system defends your body against foreign or harmful substances. For example, it sends special cells to protect organs that are in danger.\\n                \\nThese cells release chemicals that recruit other cells to isolate and destroy the harmful substance. Inflammation occurs during this process. Once the harmful substance is gone, the cells and the inflammation go away.\\n                \\nIn people who have sarcoidosis, the inflammation doesn't go away. Instead, some of the immune system cells cluster to form lumps called granulomas in various organs in your body.\\n                \\nGenetics also may play a role in sarcoidosis. Researchers believe that sarcoidosis occurs if:\\n                \\nYou have a certain gene or genes that raise your risk for the disease\\n                \\nAnd\\n                \\nYou're exposed to something that triggers your immune system\\n                \\nTriggers may vary depending on your genetic makeup. Certain genes may influence which organs are affected and the severity of your symptoms.\\n                \\nResearchers continue to try to pinpoint the genes that are linked to sarcoidosis.\", \"Sarcoidosis affects people of all ages and races. However, it's more common among African Americans and Northern Europeans. In the United States, the disease affects African Americans somewhat more often and more severely than Whites.\\n                \\nStudies have shown that sarcoidosis tends to vary amongst ethnic groups. For example, eye problems related to the disease are more common in Japanese people.\\n                \\nLofgren's syndrome, a type of sarcoidosis, is more common in people of European descent. Lofgren's syndrome may involve fever, enlarged lymph nodes, arthritis (usually in the ankles), and/or erythema nodosum. Erythema nodosum is a rash of red or reddish-purple bumps on your ankles and shins. The rash may be warm and tender to the touch.\\n                \\nSarcoidosis is somewhat more common in women than in men. The disease usually develops between the ages of 20 and 50. People who have a family history of sarcoidosis also are at higher risk for the disease.\\n                \\nResearchers have looked for a link between sarcoidosis and exposure to workplace and environmental factors. However, no clear link has been found.\", 'Many people who have sarcoidosis have no signs or symptoms or mild ones. Often, the disease is found when a chest x ray is done for another reason (for example, to diagnose pneumonia).\\n                \\nThe signs and symptoms of sarcoidosis vary depending on which organs are affected. Signs and symptoms also may vary depending on your gender, age, and ethnic background. (For more information, go to \"Who Is at Risk for Sarcoidosis?\")\\n                \\nCommon Signs and Symptoms\\n                \\nIn both adults and children, sarcoidosis most often affects the lungs. If granulomas (inflamed lumps) form in your lungs, you may wheeze, cough, feel short of breath, or have chest pain. Or, you may have no symptoms at all.\\n                \\nSome people who have sarcoidosis feel very tired, uneasy, or depressed. Night sweats and weight loss are common symptoms of the disease.\\n                \\nCommon signs and symptoms in children are fatigue (tiredness), loss of appetite, weight loss, bone and joint pain, and anemia.\\n                \\nChildren who are younger than 4 years old may have a distinct form of sarcoidosis. It may cause enlarged lymph nodes in the chest (which can be seen on chest x-ray pictures), skin lesions, and eye swelling or redness.\\n                \\nOther Signs and Symptoms\\n                \\nSarcoidosis may affect your lymph nodes. The disease can cause enlarged lymph nodes that feel tender. Sarcoidosis usually affects the lymph nodes in your neck and chest. However, the disease also may affect the lymph nodes under your chin, in your armpits, or in your groin.\\n                \\nSarcoidosis can cause lumps, ulcers (sores), or areas of discolored skin. These areas may itch, but they don\\'t hurt. These signs tend to appear on your back, arms, legs, and scalp. Sometimes they appear near your nose or eyes. These signs usually last a long time.\\n                \\nSarcoidosis may cause a more serious skin condition called lupus pernio. Disfiguring skin sores may affect your nose, nasal passages, cheeks, ears, eyelids, and fingers. These sores tend to be ongoing. They can return after treatment is over.\\n                \\nSarcoidosis also can cause eye problems. If you have sarcoidosis, having an annual eye exam is important. If you have changes in your vision and can\\'t see as clearly or can\\'t see color, call 911 or have someone drive you to the emergency room.\\n                \\nYou should call your doctor if you have any new eye symptoms, such as burning, itching, tearing, pain, or sensitivity to light.\\n                \\nSigns and symptoms of sarcoidosis also may include an enlarged liver, spleen, or salivary glands.\\n                \\nAlthough less common, sarcoidosis can affect the heart and brain. This can cause many symptoms, such as abnormal heartbeats, shortness of breath, headaches, and vision problems. If sarcoidosis affects the heart or brain, serious complications can occur.\\n                \\nLofgren\\'s Syndrome\\n                \\nLofgren\\'s syndrome is a classic set of signs and symptoms that occur in some people when they first have sarcoidosis. Signs and symptoms may include:\\n                \\nFever. This symptom only occurs in some people.\\n                \\nEnlarged lymph nodes (which can be seen on a chest x ray).\\n                \\nArthritis, usually in the ankles. This symptom is more common in men than women.\\n                \\nErythema nodosum. This is a rash of red or reddish-purple bumps on your ankles and shins. The rash may be warm and tender to the touch. This symptom is more common in women than men.\\n                \\nSarcoidosis Signs and Symptoms', \"Your doctor will diagnose sarcoidosis based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. He or she will look for granulomas (inflamed lumps) in your organs. Your doctor also will try to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms.\\n                \\nMedical History\\n                \\nYour doctor may ask you detailed questions about your medical history. For example, he or she may ask whether you:\\n                \\nHave a family history of sarcoidosis.\\n                \\nHave had any jobs that may have raised your risk for the disease.\\n                \\nHave ever been exposed to inhaled beryllium metal. (This type of metal is used to make aircrafts and weapons.)\\n                \\nHave had contact with organic dust from birds or hay.\\n                \\nExposure to beryllium metal and organic dust can cause inflamed lumps in your lungs that look like the granulomas from sarcoidosis. However, these lumps are signs of other conditions.\\n                \\nPhysical Exam\\n                \\nYour doctor will check you for signs and symptoms of sarcoidosis. Signs and symptoms may include red bumps on your skin; swollen lymph nodes; an enlarged liver, spleen, or salivary glands; or redness in your eyes. Your doctor also will check for other causes of your symptoms.\\n                \\nYour doctor may listen to your lungs and heart. Abnormal breathing or heartbeat sounds could be a sign that sarcoidosis is affecting your lungs or heart.\\n                \\nDiagnostic Tests\\n                \\nYou may have tests to confirm a diagnosis and to find out how sarcoidosis is affecting you. Tests include a chest x ray, lung function tests, biopsy, and other tests to assess organ damage.\\n                \\nChest X Ray\\n                \\nA chest x ray is a painless test that creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart and lungs. The test may show granulomas or enlarged lymph nodes in your chest. About 95 percent of people who have sarcoidosis have abnormal chest xrays.\\n                \\nLung Function Tests\\n                \\nLung function tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. These tests can show whether sarcoidosis is affecting your lungs.\\n                \\nBiopsy\\n                \\nYour doctor may do a biopsy to confirm a diagnosis or rule out other causes of your symptoms. A biopsy involves taking a small sample of tissue from one of your affected organs.\\n                \\nUsually, doctors try to biopsy the organs that are easiest to access. Examples include the skin, tear glands, or the lymph nodes that are just under the skin.\\n                \\nIf this isn't possible, your doctor may use a positron emission tomography (PET) scan to pinpoint areas for biopsy. For this test, a small amount of radioactive substance is injected into a vein, usually in your arm.\\n                \\nThe substance, which releases energy, travels through the blood and collects in organs or tissues. Special cameras detect the energy and convert it into three-dimensional (3D) pictures.\\n                \\nIf lung function tests or a chest x ray shows signs of sarcoidosis in your lungs, your doctor may do a bronchoscopy (bron-KOS-ko-pee) to get a small sample of lung tissue.\\n                \\nDuring this procedure, a thin, flexible tube is passed through your nose (or sometimes your mouth), down your throat, and into the airways to reach your lung tissue. (For more information, go to the Health Topics Bronchoscopy article.)\\n                \\nOther Tests To Assess Organ Damage\\n                \\nYou also may have other tests to assess organ damage and find out whether you need treatment. For example, your doctor may recommend blood tests and/or an EKG (electrocardiogram).\\n                \\nIf youre diagnosed with sarcoidosis, you should see an ophthalmologist (eye specialist), even if you dont have eye symptoms. In sarcoidosis, eye damage can occur without symptoms.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283465.568022}
