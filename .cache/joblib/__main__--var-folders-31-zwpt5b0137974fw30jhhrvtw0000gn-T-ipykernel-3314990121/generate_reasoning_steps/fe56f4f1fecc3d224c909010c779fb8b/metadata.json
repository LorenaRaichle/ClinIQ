Normally, you hear these sounds at safe levels that don't affect hearing. But sounds that are too loud or loud sounds over a long time are harmful. They can damage sensitive structures of the inner ear and cause noise-induced hearing loss.    More than 30 million Americans are exposed to hazardous sound levels on a regular basis. Hazardous sound levels are louder than 80 decibels. That's not as loud as traffic on a busy street. Listening to loud music, especially on headphones, is a common cause of noise-induced hearing loss. You can protect your hearing by       - Keeping the volume down when listening to music    - Wearing earplugs when using loud equipment       NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders\", \"The thymus is a small organ in your upper chest, under your breastbone. Before birth and during childhood, the thymus helps the body make a type of white blood cell. These cells help protect you from infections.     Cancer of the thymus is rare. You are more likely to get it if you have other diseases such as myasthenia gravis, lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. Sometimes there are no symptoms. Other times, thymus cancer can cause       - A cough that doesn't go away     - Chest pain    - Trouble breathing       Doctors use a physical exam, imaging tests, and a biopsy to diagnose thymus cancer. The most common treatment is surgery to remove the tumor. Other options include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy.    NIH: National Cancer Institute\", 'Summary : Healthcare workers are exposed to many job hazards. These can include        -  Infections    - Needle injuries    -  Back injuries    -  Allergy-causing substances    -  Violence    -  Stress       Follow good job safety and injury prevention practices.

National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health', 'Your blood is living tissue made up of liquid and solids. The liquid part, called plasma, is made of water, salts and protein. Over half of your blood is plasma. The solid part of your blood contains red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.    Blood disorders affect one or more parts of the blood and prevent your blood from doing its job. They can be acute or chronic. Many blood disorders are inherited. Other causes include other diseases, side effects of medicines, and a lack of certain nutrients in your diet.    Types of blood disorders include       - Platelet disorders, excessive clotting, and bleeding problems, which affect how your blood clots    - Anemia, which happens when your blood does not carry enough oxygen to the rest of your body    - Cancers of the blood, such as leukemia and myeloma    - Eosinophilic disorders, which are problems with one type of white blood cell.']}"}, "time": 1746283467.1492329}
