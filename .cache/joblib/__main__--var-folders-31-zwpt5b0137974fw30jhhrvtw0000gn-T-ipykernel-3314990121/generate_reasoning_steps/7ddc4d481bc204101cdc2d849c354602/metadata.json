Liver function tests are blood tests that check to see how well your liver is working. They check for liver damage, and can help diagnose liver diseases such as hepatitis and cirrhosis. You may have liver function tests as part of a regular checkup. Or you may have them if you have symptoms of liver disease. Doctors also use the tests to monitor some liver diseases, treatments, and possible side effects of medicines.    Liver function tests measure certain proteins, enzymes, and substances, including:       - Albumin, a protein that the liver makes    - Total protein (TP)    - Enzymes that are found in the liver, including alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT)    - Bilirubin, a yellow substance that is part of bile. It is formed when your red blood cells break down. Too much bilirubin in the blood can cause jaundice. There is also a urine test for bilirubin.    - Prothrombin time, which measures how long it takes for your blood to clot. Prothrombin is made by the liver.', 'Cirrhosis is scarring of the liver. Scar tissue forms because of injury or long-term disease. Scar tissue cannot do what healthy liver tissue does - make protein, help fight infections, clean the blood, help digest food and store energy. Cirrhosis can lead to        - Easy bruising or bleeding, or nosebleeds    - Swelling of the abdomen or legs     - Extra sensitivity to medicines    - High blood pressure in the vein entering the liver    - Enlarged veins called varices in the esophagus and stomach. Varices can bleed suddenly.    -  Kidney failure    - Jaundice    - Severe itching    - Gallstones       A small number of people with cirrhosis get liver cancer.    Your doctor will diagnose cirrhosis with blood tests, imaging tests, or a biopsy.    Cirrhosis has many causes. In the United States, the most common causes are chronic alcoholism and hepatitis. Nothing will make the scar tissue disappear, but treating the cause can keep it from getting worse. If too much scar tissue forms, you may need to consider a liver transplant.     NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Summary : Club drugs are group of psychoactive drugs. They act on the central nervous system and can cause changes in mood, awareness, and how you act. These drugs are often abused by young adults at all-night dance parties, dance clubs, and bars. They include       - Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), also known as Ecstasy XTC, X, E, Adam, Molly, Hug Beans, and Love Drug    - Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), also known as G, Liquid Ecstasy, and Soap    - Ketamine, also known as Special K, K, Vitamin K, and Jet    - Rohypnol, also known as Roofies    - Methamphetamine, also known as Speed, Ice, Chalk, Meth, Crystal, Crank, and Glass    - Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD), also known as Acid, Blotter, and Dots       Some of these drugs are approved for certain medical uses. Other uses of these drugs are abuse.    Club drugs are also sometimes used as \"date rape\" drugs, to make someone unable to say no to or fight back against sexual assault. Abusing these drugs can cause serious health problems and sometimes death. They are even more dangerous if you use them with alcohol.     NIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse', 'Malaria is a serious disease caused by a parasite. You get it when an infected mosquito bites you. Malaria is a major cause of death worldwide, but it is almost wiped out in the United States. The disease is mostly a problem in developing countries with warm climates. If you travel to these countries, you are at risk. There are four different types of malaria caused by four related parasites. The most deadly type occurs in Africa south of the Sahara Desert.    Malaria symptoms include chills, flu-like symptoms, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and jaundice. A blood test can diagnose it. It can be life-threatening. However, you can treat malaria with drugs. The type of drug depends on which kind of malaria you have and where you were infected.    Malaria can be prevented. When traveling to areas where malaria is found       - See your doctor for medicines that protect you     - Wear insect repellent with DEET     - Cover up    - Sleep under mosquito netting        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention']}"}, "time": 1746283466.8027189}
