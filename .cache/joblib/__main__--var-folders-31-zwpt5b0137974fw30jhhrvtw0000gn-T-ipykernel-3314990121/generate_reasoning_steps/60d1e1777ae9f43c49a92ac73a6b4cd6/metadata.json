In children and adolescents, Lemierre syndrome usually begins with a severe sore throat, persistent fever, and possibly chills. Some cases begin with acute otitis media. As the syndrome progresses, there is neck pain and tender swelling along the internal jugular vein.[ If undiagnosed, the next stage is the \"metastasis\" of septic emboli to the lungs, abdominal organs, brain or heart. Lung involvement typically results in a productive cough (a cough that brings up mucus or phlegm) and chest pain. Girls may report abdominal pain and have enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly) and jaundice, all of which indicate involvement of the liver.', 'What causes Lemierre syndrome? In about 90% of cases, Lemierre syndrome is caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum; however, the syndrome has also been reported with other bacteria, including Stapylococcus aureus, Bacteroides, Eikenella, Porphyromonas, Prevotella, Proteus, Peptostreptococcus and Streptococcus pyogenes.', 'How is Lemierre syndrome diagnosed? After performing blood cultures and complete blood counts, contrast computed tomography (CT) of the neck provides the definitive diagnosis. Ultrasound can also confirm internal jugular vein thrombosis.', 'How is Lemierre syndrome treated? Most cases of internal jugular thrombophlebitis can be managed medically without the need for surgery of the infected vein. Prolonged courses of intravenous antibiotics (3 to 6 weeks) is usually required. Anticoagulants have sometimes been used, but efficacy is unconfirmed. Surgery of the internal jugular vein may be required only in the rare patient who fails to respond to antibiotic treatment alone.']}"}, "time": 1746283456.6848571}
