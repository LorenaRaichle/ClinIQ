No wonder a lot of things can go wrong. Here are a few common problems:       - Bunions - hard, painful bumps on the big toe joint    -  Corns and calluses - thickened skin from friction or pressure    -  Plantar warts - warts on the soles of your feet    -  Fallen arches - also called flat feet        Ill-fitting shoes often cause these problems. Aging and being overweight also increase your chances of having foot problems.', \"If you've ever gotten a splinter or had sand in your eye, you've had experience with a foreign body. A foreign body is something that is stuck inside you but isn't supposed to be there. You may inhale or swallow a foreign body, or you may get one from an injury to almost any part of your body. Foreign bodies are more common in small children, who sometimes stick things in their mouths, ears, and noses.    Some foreign bodies, like a small splinter, do not cause serious harm. Inhaled or swallowed foreign bodies may cause choking or bowel obstruction and may require medical care.\", \"Summary : People in the U.S. are living longer than ever before. Many seniors live active and healthy lives. But there's no getting around one thing: as we age, our bodies and minds change. There are things you can do to stay healthy and active as you age:       - Eat a balanced diet    - Keep your mind and body active    - Don't smoke    - Get regular checkups    - Practice safety habits to avoid accidents and prevent falls       NIH: National Institute on Aging\", 'A fall can change your life. If you\\'re elderly, it can lead to disability and a loss of independence. If your bones are fragile from osteoporosis, you could break a bone, often a hip. But aging alone doesn\\'t make people fall. Diabetes and heart disease affect balance. So do problems with circulation, thyroid or nervous systems. Some medicines make people dizzy. Eye problems or alcohol can be factors. Any of these things can make a fall more likely. Babies and young children are also at risk of falling - off of furniture and down stairs, for example.    Falls and accidents seldom \"just happen.\" Taking care of your health by exercising and getting regular eye exams and physicals may help reduce your chance of falling. Getting rid of tripping hazards in your home and wearing nonskid shoes may also help. To reduce the chances of breaking a bone if you do fall, make sure that you get enough calcium and vitamin D.
