Bethlem myopathy is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, as are some cases of the intermediate form and a few rare instances of Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy. Most cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. In other cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent.  Collagen VI-related myopathy can be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, as are some cases of the intermediate form and a few rare instances of Bethlem myopathy. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.', 'These resources address the diagnosis or management of collagen VI-related myopathy:  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Collagen Type VI-Related Disorders  - Genetic Testing Registry: Bethlem myopathy  - Genetic Testing Registry: Collagen Type VI-Related Autosomal Dominant Limb-girdle Muscular Dystrophy  - Genetic Testing Registry: Collagen VI-related myopathy  - Genetic Testing Registry: Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy  - Muscular Dystrophy UK: Could Cyclosporine A be used to treat Bethlem myopathy and Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy?

People with KID syndrome usually have keratitis, which is inflammation of the front surface of the eye (the cornea). The keratitis may cause pain, increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), abnormal blood vessel growth over the cornea (neovascularization), and scarring. Over time, affected individuals experience a loss of sharp vision (reduced visual acuity); in severe cases the keratitis can lead to blindness.  Most people with KID syndrome have thick, hard skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet (palmoplantar keratoderma). Affected individuals also have thick, reddened patches of skin (erythrokeratoderma) that are dry and scaly (ichthyosis). These dry patches can occur anywhere on the body, although they most commonly affect the neck, groin, and armpits. Breaks in the skin often occur and may lead to infections. In severe cases these infections can be life-threatening, especially in infancy. Approximately 12 percent of people with KID syndrome develop a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma, which may also affect mucous membranes such as the lining of the mouth.  Partial hair loss is a common feature of KID syndrome, and often affects the eyebrows and eyelashes. Affected individuals may also have small, abnormally formed nails.  Hearing loss in this condition is usually profound, but occasionally is less severe.', 'KID syndrome is a rare disorder. Its prevalence is unknown. Approximately 100 cases have been reported.']}"}, "time": 1746283447.537799}
