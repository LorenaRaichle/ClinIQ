Have your veterinarian treat your dogs and cats, especially young animals, regularly for worms. This is especially important if your pets spend time outdoors and may become infected again.\\n    \\nThere are several things that you can do around your home to make you and your pets safer:\\n    \\n     - Clean your pet\u2019s living area at least once a week. Feces should be either buried or bagged and disposed of in the trash. Wash your hands after handling pet waste.\\n     - Do not allow children to play in areas that are soiled with pet or other animal feces and cover sandboxes when not in use to make sure that animals do not get inside and contaminate them.\\n     - Wash your hands with soap and warm water after playing with your pets or other animals, after outdoor activities, and before handling food.\\n     - Teach children the importance of washing hands to prevent infection.\\n     - Teach children that it is dangerous to eat dirt or soil.\\n    \\n    \\nMore on: Handwashing\\n    \\nToxocara eggs have a strong protective layer which makes the eggs able to survive in the environment for months or even years under the right conditions. Many common disinfectants are not effective against Toxocara eggs but extreme heat has been shown to kill the eggs. Prompt removal of animal feces can help prevent infection since the eggs require 2 to 4 weeks to become infective once they are out of the animal.', 'Schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia, is a disease caused by parasitic worms. Infection with Schistosoma mansoni, S. haematobium, and S. japonicum causes illness in humans; less commonly, S. mekongi and S. intercalatum can cause disease. Although the worms that cause schistosomiasis are not found in the United States, more than 200 million people are infected worldwide.', 'Schistosomiasis is an important cause of disease in many parts of the world, most commonly in places with poor sanitation. School-age children who live in these areas are often most at risk because they tend to spend time swimming or bathing in water containing infectious cercariae.\\nIf you live in, or travel to, areas where schistosomiasis is found and are exposed to contaminated freshwater, you are at risk.\\n   \\nAreas where human schistosomiasis is found include:\\n   \\n    - Schistosoma mansoni \\n     \\n      - distributed throughout Africa: There is risk of infection in freshwater in southern and sub-Saharan Africa\u2013including the great lakes and rivers as well as smaller bodies of water.

The eggs tend to be passed intermittently and in small amounts and may not be detected, so it may be necessary to perform a blood (serologic) test.\\n    \\nMore on: Resources for Health Professionals: Diagnosis']}"}, "time": 1746283483.8097181}
