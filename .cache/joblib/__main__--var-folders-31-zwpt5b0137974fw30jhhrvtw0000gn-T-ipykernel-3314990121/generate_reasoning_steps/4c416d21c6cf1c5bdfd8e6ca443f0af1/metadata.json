This is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating blood diseases and disorders.\\n                \\nYou may have APS and another autoimmune disorder, such as lupus. If so, a doctor who specializes in that disorder also may provide treatment.\\n                \\nMany autoimmune disorders that occur with APS also affect the joints, bones, or muscles. Rheumatologists specialize in treating these types of disorders.\\n                \\nMedical History\\n                \\nSome people have APS antibodies but no signs or symptoms of the disorder. Having APS antibodies doesn\\'t mean that you have APS. To be diagnosed with APS, you must have APS antibodies and a history of health problems related to the disorder.\\n                \\nAPS can lead to many health problems, including stroke, heart attack, kidney damage, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism.\\n                \\nAPS also can cause pregnancy-related problems, such as multiple miscarriages, a miscarriage late in pregnancy, or a premature birth due to eclampsia. (Eclampsia, which follows preeclampsia, is a serious condition that causes seizures in pregnant women.)\\n                \\nBlood Tests\\n                \\nYour doctor can use blood tests to confirm a diagnosis of APS. These tests check your blood for any of the three APS antibodies: anticardiolipin, beta-2 glycoprotein I (2GPI), and lupus anticoagulant.\\n                \\nThe term \"anticoagulant\" (AN-te-ko-AG-u-lant) refers to a substance that prevents blood clotting. It may seem odd that one of the APS antibodies is called lupus anticoagulant. The reason for this is because the antibody slows clotting in lab tests. However, in the human body, it increases the risk of blood clotting.\\n                \\nTo test for APS antibodies, a small blood sample is taken. It\\'s often drawn from a vein in your arm using a needle. The procedure usually is quick and easy, but it may cause some short-term discomfort and a slight bruise.\\n                \\nYou may need a second blood test to confirm positive results. This is because a single positive test can result from a short-term infection. The second blood test often is done 12 weeks or more after the first one.', 'Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) has no cure. However, medicines can help prevent complications. The goals of treatment are to prevent blood clots from forming and keep existing clots from getting larger.\\n                \\nYou may have APS and another autoimmune disorder, such as lupus. If so, it\\'s important to control that condition as well. When the other condition is controlled, APS may cause fewer problems.\\n                \\nResearch is ongoing for new ways to treat APS.\\n                \\nMedicines\\n                \\nAnticoagulants, or \"blood thinners,\" are used to stop blood clots from forming. They also may keep existing blood clots from getting larger. These medicines are taken as either a pill, an injection under the skin, or through a needle or tube inserted into a vein (called intravenous, or IV, injection).\\n                \\nWarfarin and heparin are two blood thinners used to treat APS. Warfarin is given in pill form. (Coumadin is a common brand name for warfarin.) Heparin is given as an injection or through an IV tube. There are different types of heparin. Your doctor will discuss the options with you.\\n                \\nYour doctor may treat you with both heparin and warfarin at the same time. Heparin acts quickly. Warfarin takes 2 to 3 days before it starts to work. Once the warfarin starts to work, the heparin is stopped.\\n                \\nAspirin also thins the blood and helps prevent blood clots. Sometimes aspirin is used with warfarin. Other times, aspirin might be used alone.\\n                \\nBlood thinners don\\'t prevent APS. They simply reduce the risk of further blood clotting. Treatment with these medicines is long term. Discuss all treatment options with your doctor.\\n                \\nSide Effects\\n                \\nThe most common side effect of blood thinners is bleeding. This happens if the medicine thins your blood too much. This side effect can be life threatening.\\n                \\nSometimes the bleeding is internal (inside your body). People treated with blood thinners usually need regular blood tests, called PT and PTT tests, to check how well their blood is clotting.\\n                \\nThese tests also show whether you\\'re taking the right amount of medicine. Your doctor will check to make sure that you\\'re taking enough medicine to prevent clots, but not so much that it causes bleeding.\\n                \\nTalk with your doctor about the warning signs of internal bleeding and when to seek emergency care. (For more information, go to \"Living With Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome.\")\\n                \\nTreatment During Pregnancy\\n                \\nPregnant women who have APS can have successful pregnancies. With proper treatment, these women are more likely to carry their babies to term.\\n                \\nPregnant women who have APS usually are treated with heparin or heparin and low-dose aspirin. Warfarin is not used as a treatment during pregnancy because it can harm the fetus.\\n                \\nBabies whose mothers have APS are at higher risk for slowed growth while in the womb. If you\\'re pregnant and have APS, you may need to have extra ultrasound tests (sonograms) to check your babys growth. An ultrasound test uses sound waves to look at the growing fetus.\\n                \\nTreatment for Other Medical Conditions\\n                \\nPeople who have APS are at increased risk for thrombocytopenia. This is a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal number of blood cell fragments called platelets. Platelets help the blood clot.\\n                \\nIf you have APS, you\\'ll need regular complete blood counts (a type of blood test) to count the number of platelets in your blood.\\n                \\nThrombocytopenia is treated with medicines and medical procedures. For more information, go to the Health Topics Thrombocytopenia article.\\n                \\nIf you have other health problems, such as heart disease or diabetes, work with your doctor to manage them.', \"Marfan syndrome is a condition in which your body's connective tissue is abnormal. Connective tissue helps support all parts of your body. It also helps control how your body grows and develops.\\n                \\nMarfan syndrome most often affects the connective tissue of the heart and blood vessels, eyes, bones, lungs, and covering of the spinal cord. Because the condition affects many parts of the body, it can cause many complications. Sometimes the complications are life threatening.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nMarfan syndrome is a genetic disorder. A mutation, or change, in the gene that controls how the body makes fibrillin causes Marfan syndrome. Fibrillin is a protein that plays a major role in your body's connective tissue.\\n                \\nMost people who have Marfan syndrome inherit it from their parents. If you have Marfan syndrome, you have a 50 percent chance of passing the altered gene to each of your children.\\n                \\nIn about 1 in 4 cases, the mutation that causes Marfan syndrome is not inherited. Thus, the affected person is the first in his or her family to have the condition.\\n                \\nMarfan syndrome often affects the long bones of the body. This can lead to signs, or traits, such as:\\n                \\nA tall, thin build.\\n                \\nLong arms, legs, fingers, and toes and flexible joints.\\n                \\nA spine that curves to one side. This condition is called scoliosis (sko-le-O-sis).\\n                \\nA chest that sinks in or sticks out. These conditions are called pectus excavatum (eks-ka-VA-tum) and pectus carinatum (ka-ri-NA-tum), respectively.\\n                \\nTeeth that are too crowded.\\n                \\nFlat feet.\\n                \\nMarfan syndrome traits vary from person to person, even in the same family. Some people who have the condition have many traits, while others have few.\\n                \\nThe most serious complications of Marfan syndrome involve the heart and blood vessels. Marfan syndrome can affect the aorta, the main blood vessel that supplies oxygen-rich blood to the body. In Marfan syndrome, the aorta can stretch and grow weak. This condition is called aortic dilation (di-LA-shun) or aortic aneurysm (AN-u-rism).\\n                \\nIf the aorta stretches and grows weak, it may tear or burst and leak blood. This condition is called aortic dissection. It's very serious and can lead to severe heart problems or even death.\\n                \\nMarfan syndrome has no cure, but treatments can help delay or prevent complications. Treatments include medicines, surgery, and other therapies. Limiting certain activities, or changing how you do them, may help reduce the risks to the aorta, eyes, and joints.\\n                \\nThe type of treatment you receive depends on how the condition is affecting your body.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nAbout 1 out of every 5,000 people in the United States has Marfan syndrome. Men, women, children, and people of all races can have the condition.\\n                \\nAdvances have been made in the early diagnosis and treatment of Marfan syndrome. It's now possible for people who have the condition to live longer and enjoy a good quality of life. Many people who have Marfan syndrome and are properly diagnosed and treated may live an average lifespan.\\n                \\nResearchers continue to study the condition and look for better treatments.\", \"Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder.
