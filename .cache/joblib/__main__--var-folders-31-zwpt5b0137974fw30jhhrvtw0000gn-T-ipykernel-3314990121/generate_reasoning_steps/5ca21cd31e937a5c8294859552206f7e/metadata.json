The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 10 . If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Microcephaly 90% Respiratory insufficiency 90% Seizures 90% Abnormality of metabolism/homeostasis - Apnea - Ataxia - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Cerebellar atrophy - Cerebral atrophy - Congenital onset - Increased neuronal autofluorescent lipopigment - Intellectual disability, progressive - Intellectual disability, severe - Low-set ears - Neuronal loss in central nervous system - Premature closure of fontanelles - Respiratory failure - Retinal atrophy - Rigidity - Rod-cone dystrophy - Sloping forehead - Spasticity - Status epilepticus - Visual loss - Wide nasal bridge - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Brown-Sequard syndrome is a rare neurological condition characterized by a lesion in the spinal cord. This condition results in weakness or paralysis on one side of the body (hemiparaplegia) and a loss of sensation  on the opposite side (hemianesthesia). Brown-Sequard syndrome may be caused by a spinal cord tumor, trauma (such as a puncture wound to the neck or back), obstructed blood vessel, or infectious or inflammatory diseases such as tuberculosis, or multiple sclerosis. Treatment and prognosis depends on the underlying cause of the condition.', 'How might Brown-Sequard syndrome be treated?', 'Holt-Oram syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by skeletal abnormalities of the hands and arms (upper limbs) and heart problems. Affected people have at least one bone abnormality in the wrist, many of which can be detected only by X-ray. Additional skeletal abnormalities may also be present. About 75% of affected people have heart problems, including congenital heart defects and/or cardiac conduction disease (an abnormality in the electrical system that coordinates contractions of the heart chambers). Holt-Oram syndrome is caused by mutations in the TBX5 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no family history of the condition.']}"}, "time": 1746283458.977612}
