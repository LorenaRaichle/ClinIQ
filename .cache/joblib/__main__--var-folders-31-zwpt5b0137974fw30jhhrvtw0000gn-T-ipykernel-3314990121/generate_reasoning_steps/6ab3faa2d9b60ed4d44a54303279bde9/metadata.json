If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Anteverted nares 90% Broad forehead 90% Frontal bossing 90% Hypertelorism 90% Hypoplasia of the zygomatic bone 90% Clinodactyly of the 5th finger 50% Cognitive impairment 50% Long philtrum 50% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Optic atrophy polyneuropathy deafness?

The disorder is characterized by destruction of the myelin, the fatty tissue that surrounds and protects the nerve fibers and promotes the transmission of nerve impulses, and damage to nerve cells. The symptoms vary widely from person to person, and may include sensory disturbances in the limbs, problems with muscle control, tremors, muscle stiffness (spasticity), exaggerated reflexes (hyperreflexia), weakness, difficulty walking, poor bladder control, and vision problems. Most patients have periods during which they have symptoms (clinical attacks). The clinical attacks are typically followed by periods without any symptoms (remission). After several years, the symptoms worsen continuously. Multiple sclerosis is considered an autoimmune disorder but the exact cause is unknown. Risk factors for developing multiple sclerosis include genetic factors like changes in the HLA-DRB1 gene and in the IL7R gene and environmental factors, such as exposure to the Epstein-Barr virus, low levels of vitamin D, and smoking. The goal of treatment of MS is to decrease attacks and the inflammation within the central nervous system.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Multiple sclerosis? The peak age of onset is between ages 20 and 40, although it may develop in children and has also been identified in individuals over 60 years of age. The most common signs and symptoms include sensory disturbance of the limbs; partial or complete visual loss; acute and subacute motor dysfunction of the limbs; diplopia (double vision); and gait dysfunction. These signs and symptoms may occur alone or in combination, and have to be present for a minimum of 24 hours to be considered a \"clinical attack.\" The signs and symptoms in individuals with MS are extremely variable, even among affected relatives within families. Symptoms vary because the location and severity of each attack can be different. Episodes can last for days, weeks, or months. These episodes alternate with periods of reduced or no symptoms (remissions). While it is common for the disease to return (relapse), the disease may continue to get worse without periods of remission. Because nerves in any part of the brain or spinal cord may be damaged, patients with multiple sclerosis can have symptoms in many parts of the body. Muscle symptoms may include loss of balance, muscle spasms, numbness or abnormal sensation in any area, problems moving arms or legs, problems walking, problems with coordination and making small movements, and tremor or weakness in one or more arms or legs. Bowel and bladder symptoms may include constipation and stool leakage, difficulty beginning to urinate, frequent need or strong urge to urinate, and incontinence. Eye symptoms may include double vision, eye discomfort, uncontrollable rapid eye movements, and vision loss. There may be numbness, tingling, or pain in the face, muscles, arms or legs. Other brain and nerve symptoms may include decreased attention span, poor judgment, and memory loss; difficulty reasoning and solving problems; depression or feelings of sadness; dizziness and balance problems; and hearing loss. Individuals may also have slurred or difficult-to-understand speech, trouble chewing and swallowing, and sexual symptoms such as problems with erections or vaginal lubrication.
