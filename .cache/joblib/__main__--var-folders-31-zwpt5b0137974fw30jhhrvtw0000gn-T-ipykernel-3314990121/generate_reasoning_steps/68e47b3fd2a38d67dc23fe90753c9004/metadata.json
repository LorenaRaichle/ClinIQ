A diagnosis of pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta is often suspected based on characteristic signs and symptoms. A skin biopsy can be used to confirm the diagnosis. Additional laboratory testing may be ordered to investigate a possible cause such as an associated infection.', 'How might pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta be treated? Pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta (PLEVA) often resolves on its own within several weeks to several months. Depending on the severity of the condition and the symptoms present, treatment may not be necessary. If treatment is indicated, there are many different therapies that have been used to treat PLEVA with varying degrees of success. These include: Oral antibiotics Sun exposure Topical steroids Immunomodulators (medications used to help regulate or normalize the immune system) Phototherapy Systemic steroids Unfortunately, PLEVA may not always respond to treatment and relapses often occur when treatment is discontinued.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Mitral valve prolapse, familial, X-linked? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Mitral valve prolapse, familial, X-linked. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal dominant inheritance - Disproportionate tall stature - High palate - Mitral regurgitation - Mitral valve prolapse - Pectus excavatum - Reversed usual vertebral column curves - Striae distensae - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is a form of degenerative arthritis in which the ligaments (connective tissues that connect bones) around the spine turn into bone. Many people with this condition do not experience any symptoms. When present, the most common features are pain and stiffness of the upper back; however, other symptoms may also develop when bone spurs press on nearby organs or parts of the body. The exact underlying cause of DISH remains unknown, although risk factors such as age, gender, long-term use of certain medications and chronic health conditions have been identified. Treatment for DISH depends on many factors including the signs and symptoms present in each person and the severity of the condition.']}"}, "time": 1746283460.911534}
