The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Mucolipidosis type 4. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the abdominal wall musculature 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Gait disturbance 90% Hyperreflexia 90% Neurological speech impairment 90% Opacification of the corneal stroma 90% Photophobia 90% Retinopathy 90% Strabismus 90% EEG abnormality 50% Incoordination 50% Muscular hypotonia 50% Nystagmus 50% Abnormal electroretinogram 7.5% Abnormal nasal morphology 7.5% Abnormality of retinal pigmentation 7.5% Coarse facial features 7.5% Genu recurvatum 7.5% Microcephaly 7.5% Microdontia 7.5% Narrow forehead 7.5% Palmoplantar keratoderma 7.5% Abnormality of ganglioside metabolism - Abnormality of mucopolysaccharide metabolism - Abnormality of the abdomen - Absent speech - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Babinski sign - Cerebellar atrophy - Cerebral dysmyelination - Decreased light- and dark-adapted electroretinogram amplitude - Developmental stagnation - Dysplastic corpus callosum - Dystonia - Infantile onset - Intellectual disability - Optic atrophy - Progressive retinal degeneration - Spastic tetraplegia - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Osteopetrosis is a bone disease that makes bones abnormally dense and prone to breakage (fracture). Researchers have described several major types of osteopetrosis, which are usually distinguished by their pattern of inheritance: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked. The different types of the disorder can also be distinguished by the severity of their signs and symptoms. Mutations in at least nine genes cause the various types of osteopetrosis.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Osteopetrosis autosomal recessive 2? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Osteopetrosis autosomal recessive 2.
