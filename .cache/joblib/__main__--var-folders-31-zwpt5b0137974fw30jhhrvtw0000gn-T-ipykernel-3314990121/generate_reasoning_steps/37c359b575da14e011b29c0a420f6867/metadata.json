People who do not have any symptoms or signs of babesiosis usually do not need to be treated.\\n    \\nBefore considering treatment, the first step is to make sure the diagnosis is correct.\\n    \\nFor more information, people should talk to their health care provider.\\n    \\nMore on: Resources for Health Professionals: Treatment', 'Steps can be taken to reduce the risk for babesiosis and other tickborne infections. The use of prevention measures is especially important for people at increased risk for severe babesiosis (for example, people who do not have a spleen). Avoiding exposure to tick habitats is the best defense.\\n   \\nBabesia microti is spread by Ixodes scapularis ticks, which are mostly found in wooded, brushy, or grassy areas, in certain regions and seasons. No vaccine is available to protect people against babesiosis. However, people who live, work, or travel in tick-infested areas can take simple steps to help protect themselves against tick bites and tickborne infections.\\n   \\n    \\n   \\n   \\nDuring outdoor activities in tick habitats, take precautions to keep ticks off the skin.\\n   \\n    - Walk on cleared trails and stay in the center of the trail, to minimize contact with leaf litter, brush, and overgrown grasses, where ticks are most likely to be found.\\n    - Minimize the amount of exposed skin, by wearing socks, long pants, and a long-sleeved shirt. Tuck the pant legs into the socks, so ticks cannot crawl up the inside of the pants. Wear light-colored clothing, to make it easier to see and remove ticks before they attach to skin.\\n    - Apply repellents to skin and clothing. Follow the instructions on the product label. \\n     \\n      - Products that contain DEET (N,N-diethylmetatoluamide) can be directly applied to exposed skin and to clothing, to help keep ticks away (by repelling them). The product label includes details about how and where to apply the repellent, how often to reapply it, and how to use it safely on children.\\n      - Permethrin products can be applied to clothing/boots (not to skin), actually kill ticks that come in contact with the treated clothing, and usually stay effective through several washings.\\n     \\n   \\n   \\n    \\n   \\n   \\nAfter outdoor activities, conduct daily tick checks and promptly remove any ticks that are found. Thorough, daily tick checks are very important. The I. scapularis nymphs that typically spread B. microti are so small (about the size of a poppy seed) that they are easily overlooked. But they usually must stay attached to a person for more than 36-48 hours to be able to transmit the parasite.\\n   \\n    - Remove ticks from clothing and pets before going indoors.\\n    - Conduct a full-body exam for ticks. Use a hand-held or full-length mirror to view all parts of the body. Be sure to check behind the knees, between the legs (groin/thighs), between the toes, under the arms (armpits), around the waist, inside the belly button, the back of the neck, behind and in the ears, as well as in and around the scalp, hairline, and hair. Remember to check children and pets, too.\\n   \\n   \\nRemove ticks that are attached to the skin as soon as possible, preferably by using pointed (fine-tipped) tweezers. Grab the tick\u2019s mouth parts close to the skin, and slowly pull the tick straight out (with steady outward pressure), until the tick lets go.\\n   \\nMore on: Removing Ticks\\n   \\nMore on: Ticks', 'Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease that is spread through the air from one person to another. There are two kinds of tests that are used to determine if a person has been infected with TB bacteria: the tuberculin skin test and TB blood tests. \\n  \\nA positive TB skin test or TB blood test only tells that a person has been infected with TB bacteria. It does not tell whether the person has latent TB infection (LTBI) or has progressed to TB disease. Other tests, such as a chest x-ray and a sample of sputum, are needed to see whether the person has TB disease. \\n  \\nTuberculin skin test: The TB skin test (also called the Mantoux tuberculin skin test) is performed by injecting a small amount of fluid (called tuberculin) into the skin in the lower part of the arm. A person given the tuberculin skin test must return within 48 to 72 hours to have a trained health care worker look for a reaction on the arm. The health care worker will look for a raised, hard area or swelling, and if present, measure its size using a ruler. Redness by itself is not considered part of the reaction. \\n  \\nThe skin test result depends on the size of the raised, hard area or swelling. It also depends on the person\u2019s risk of being infected with TB bacteria and the progression to TB disease if infected. \\n   \\n   - Positive skin test: This \\n     means the person\u2019s body was infected with TB bacteria. Additional tests are needed to determine if the person has latent TB infection or TB disease. A health care worker will then provide treatment as needed. \\n   - Negative skin test: This means the person\u2019s body did not react to the test, and that latent TB infection or TB disease is not likely. \\n   \\n  \\n \\n     TB blood tests: \\n    TB blood tests (also called interferon-gamma release assays or IGRAs) measure how the immune system reacts to the bacteria that cause TB. An IGRA measures how strong a person\u2019s immune system reacts to TB bacteria by testing the person\u2019s blood in a laboratory. \\n  \\nTwo IGRAs are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are available in the United States: \\n   \\n   - QuantiFERON\u00ae\u2013TB Gold In-Tube test (QFT-GIT) \\n   - T-SPOT\u00ae.TB test (T-Spot) \\n   \\n   \\n   - Positive IGRA: This means that the person has been infected with TB bacteria. Additional tests are needed to determine if the person has latent TB infection or TB disease. A health care worker will then provide treatment as needed. \\n   - Negative IGRA: This means that the person\u2019s blood did not react to the test and that latent TB infection or TB disease is not likely. \\n   \\n  \\nIGRAs are the preferred method of TB infection testing for the following: \\n    \\n   - People who have a difficult time returning for a second appointment to look for a reaction to the TST. \\n   \\n  \\nThere is no problem with repeated IGRAs. \\n    \\n   \\n   \\n     Testing for TB in BCG-Vaccinated Persons \\n  \\nMany people born outside of the United States have been BCG-vaccinated. \\n  \\nPeople who have had a previous BCG vaccine may receive a TB skin test. In some people, BCG may cause a positive skin test when they are not infected with TB bacteria. If a TB skin test is positive, additional tests are needed. \\n  \\nIGRAs, unlike the TB skin tests, are not affected by prior BCG vaccination and are not expected to give a false-positive result in people who have received BCG. \\n   \\n     Choosing a TB Test \\n  \\nThe person\u2019s health care provider should choose which TB test to use. Factors in selecting which test to use include the reason for testing, test availability, and cost. Generally, it is not recommended to test a person with both a TST and an IGRA. \\n   \\n     Diagnosis of Latent TB Infection or TB Disease \\n  \\nIf a person is found to be infected with TB bacteria, other tests are needed to see if the person has TB disease. \\n  \\nTB disease can be diagnosed by medical history, physical examination, chest x-ray, and other laboratory tests. TB disease is treated by taking several drugs as recommended by a health care provider. \\n  \\nIf a person does not have TB disease, but has TB bacteria in the body, then latent TB infection is diagnosed. The decision about treatment for latent TB infection will be based on a person\u2019s chances of developing TB disease. \\n   \\n     Diagnosis of TB Disease \\n  \\nPeople suspected of having TB disease should be referred for a medical evaluation, which will include \\n   \\n   - Medical history, \\n   - Physical examination, \\n   - Test for TB infection (TB skin test or TB blood test), \\n   - Chest radiograph (X-ray), and \\n   - Appropriate laboratory tests \\n   \\n  \\nSee Diagnosis of TB (Fact sheet) for more information about TB diagnosis. \\n   \\n    \\n      Related Links \\n     \\n    \\n   For Patients \\n        \\n    \\n   For Health Care Providers']}"}, "time": 1746283483.7899232}
