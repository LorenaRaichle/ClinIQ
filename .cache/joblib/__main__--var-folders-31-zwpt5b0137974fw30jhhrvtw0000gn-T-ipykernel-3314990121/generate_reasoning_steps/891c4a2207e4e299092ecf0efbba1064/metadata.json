Signs and symptoms of subacute cerebellar degeneration, include ataxia, speech and swallowing problems, dementia (in about half of people with this condition), and difficulty walking. People with subacute cerebellar degeneration due to thiamine deficiency may also experience quick involuntary movements of the eyeball (nystagmus), double-vision, dizziness, and paralysis of the eye muscles. In paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting may precede the neurological symptoms. Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration may occur in association with Lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome or encephalomyelitis.', \"What causes subacute cerebellar degeneration? Subacute cerebellar degeneration may occur when the body's immune system attacks healthy tissue, either for unknown reasons or as an abnormal reaction to an underlying cancer. These cases are referred to as paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. Subacute cerebellar degeneration may also occur due to thiamine deficiency. Causes of thiamin deficiency include alcoholism, recurrent vomiting, gastric surgery, and diets poor in this B vitamin. These cases are referred to as alcoholic/nutritional cerebellar degeneration. For further information pertaining to the neurological effects of severe thiamine deficiency, see the following link to the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome resource page. http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/6843/wernicke-korsakoff-syndrome/Resources/1\", 'Intestinal pseudo-obstruction is a condition characterized by impairment of the muscle contractions that move food through the digestive tract. The condition may arise from abnormalities of the gastrointestinal muscles themselves (myogenic) or from problems with the nerves that control the muscle contractions (neurogenic). When intestinal pseudo-obstruction occurs by itself, it is called primary or idiopathic (unknown cause) intestinal pseudo-obstruction. The disorder can also develop as a complication of another medical condition; in these cases, it is called secondary intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Individuals with this condition have symptoms that resemble those of an intestinal blockage (obstruction) but without any obstruction. It may be acute or chronic and is characterized by the presence of dilation of the bowel on imaging. The causes may be unknown or due to alterations (mutations) in the FLNA gene, other genes or are secondary to other conditions. It may be inherited in some cases. Intestinal pseudoobstruction neuronal chronic idiopathic X-linked is caused by alterations (mutations) in the FLNA gene which is located in the X chromosome. There is no specific treatment but several medications and procedures may be used to treat the symptoms.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Intestinal pseudoobstruction neuronal chronic idiopathic X-linked? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Intestinal pseudoobstruction neuronal chronic idiopathic X-linked. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Hydronephrosis 5% Pyloric stenosis 5% Seizures 5% Spastic diplegia 5% Abdominal distention - Abnormal facial shape - Feeding difficulties in infancy - Hypertelorism - Increased mean platelet volume - Infantile onset - Intestinal malrotation - Intestinal pseudo-obstruction - Low-set ears - Patent ductus arteriosus - Smooth philtrum - Thrombocytopenia - Vomiting - X-linked recessive inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.']}"}, "time": 1746283457.477677}
