Once respiratory failure is diagnosed, your doctor will look for its underlying cause.\\n                \\nMedical History\\n                \\nYour doctor will ask whether you might have or have recently had diseases or conditions that could lead to respiratory failure.\\n                \\nExamples include disorders that affect the muscles, nerves, bones, or tissues that support breathing. Lung diseases and conditions also can cause respiratory failure.\\n                \\nFor more information, go to \"What Causes Respiratory Failure?\"\\n                \\nPhysical Exam\\n                \\nDuring the physical exam, your doctor will look for signs of respiratory failure and its underlying cause.\\n                \\nRespiratory failure can cause shortness of breath, rapid breathing, and air hunger (feeling like you can\\'t breathe in enough air). Using a stethoscope, your doctor can listen to your lungs for abnormal sounds, such as crackling.\\n                \\nYour doctor also may listen to your heart for signs of an arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat). An arrhythmia can occur if your heart doesn\\'t get enough oxygen.\\n                \\nYour doctor might look for a bluish color on your skin, lips, and fingernails. A bluish color means your blood has a low oxygen level.\\n                \\nRespiratory failure also can cause extreme sleepiness and confusion, so your doctor might check how alert you are.\\n                \\nDiagnostic Tests\\n                \\nTo check the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in your blood, you may have: \\n                \\nPulse oximetry. For this test, a small sensor is attached to your finger or ear. The sensor uses light to estimate how much oxygen is in your blood.\\n                \\nArterial blood gas test. This test measures the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in your blood. A blood sample is taken from an artery, usually in your wrist. The sample is then sent to a laboratory, where its oxygen and carbon dioxide levels are measured.\\n                \\nA low level of oxygen or a high level of carbon dioxide in the blood (or both) is a possible sign of respiratory failure.\\n                \\nYour doctor may recommend other tests, such as a chest x ray, to help find the underlying cause of respiratory failure. A chest x ray is a painless test that takes pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels.\\n                \\nIf your doctor thinks that you have an arrhythmia as a result of respiratory failure, he or she may recommend an EKG (electrocardiogram). An EKG is a simple, painless test that detects and records the heart\\'s electrical activity.', \"Treatment for respiratory failure depends on whether the condition is acute (short-term) or chronic (ongoing) and its severity. Treatment also depends on the condition's underlying cause.\\n                \\nAcute respiratory failure can be a medical emergency. It often is treated in an intensive care unit at a hospital. Chronic respiratory failure often can be treated at home. If chronic respiratory failure is severe, your doctor may recommend treatment in a long-term care center.\\n                \\nOne of the main goals of treating respiratory failure is to get oxygen to your lungs and other organs and remove carbon dioxide from your body. Another goal is to treat the underlying cause of the condition.\\n                \\nOxygen Therapy and Ventilator Support\\n                \\nIf you have respiratory failure, you may receive oxygen therapy. Extra oxygen is given through a nasal cannula (two small plastic tubes, or prongs, that are placed in both nostrils) or through a mask that fits over your nose and mouth.\\n                \\nOxygen Therapy\\n                \\n\\n                \\nOxygen also can be given through a tracheostomy (TRA-ke-OS-to-me). This is a surgically made hole that goes through the front of your neck and into your windpipe. A breathing tube, also called a tracheostomy or trach tube, is placed in the hole to help you breathe.\\n                \\nTracheostomy\\n                \\n\\n                \\nIf the oxygen level in your blood doesn't increase, or if you're still having trouble breathing, your doctor may recommend a ventilator. A ventilator is a machine that supports breathing. It blows airor air with increased amounts of oxygeninto your airways and then your lungs.\\n                \\nVentilator\\n                \\n\\n                \\nYour doctor will adjust the ventilator as needed. This will help your lungs get the right amount of oxygen. It also can prevent the machine's pressure from injuring your lungs. You'll use the ventilator until you can breathe on your own.\\n                \\nOther Treatments To Help You Breathe\\n                \\nNoninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) and a rocking bed are two methods that can help you breathe better while you sleep. These methods are very useful for people who have chronic respiratory failure.\\n                \\nNPPV is a treatment that uses mild air pressure to keep your airways open while you sleep. You wear a mask or other device that fits over your nose or your nose and mouth. A tube connects the mask to a machine, which blows air into the tube.\\n                \\nCPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) is one type of NPPV. For more information, go to the Health Topics CPAP article. Although the article focuses on CPAP treatment for sleep apnea, it explains how CPAP works.\\n                \\nA rocking bed consists of a mattress on a motorized platform. The mattress gently rocks back and forth. When your head rocks down, the organs in your abdomen and your diaphragm (the main muscle used for breathing) slide up, helping you exhale. When your head rocks up, the organs in your abdomen and your diaphragm slide down, helping you inhale.\\n                \\nFluids\\n                \\nYou may be given fluids to improve blood flow throughout your body and to provide nutrition. Your doctor will make sure you get the right amount of fluids.\\n                \\nToo much fluid can fill the lungs and make it hard for you to get the oxygen you need. Not enough fluid can limit the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the body's organs.\\n                \\nFluids usually are given through an intravenous (IV) line inserted in one of your blood vessels.\\n                \\nMedicines\\n                \\nYour doctor may prescribe medicines to relieve discomfort.\\n                \\nTreatments for the Underlying Cause of Respiratory Failure\\n                \\nOnce your doctor figures out what's causing your respiratory failure, he or she will plan how to treat that disease or condition. Treatments may include medicines, procedures, and other therapies.\", 'Primary ciliary (SIL-e-ar-e) dyskinesia (dis-kih-NE-ze-ah), or PCD, is a rare disease that affects tiny, hair-like structures that line the airways. These structures are called cilia (SIL-e-ah).\\n                \\nCilia move together in wave-like motions. They carry mucus (a slimy substance) toward the mouth to be coughed or sneezed out of the body. The mucus contains inhaled dust, bacteria, and other small particles.\\n                \\nIf the cilia don\\'t work well, bacteria stay in your airways. This can cause breathing problems, infections, and other disorders. PCD mainly affects the sinuses, ears, and lungs. Some people who have PCD have breathing problems from the moment of birth.\\n                \\nSperm cells have structures that are like cilia. In men who have PCD, these structures also may not work well. This can cause fertility problems. \"Fertility\" refers to the ability to have children.\\n                \\nFertility problems also occur in some women who have PCD. These problems likely are due to faulty cilia in the fallopian tubes. (The fallopian tubes carry eggs from the ovaries to the uterus.)\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nPCD is an inherited disease. \"Inherited\" means the disease is passed from parents to children through genes. With PCD, this process is very complex. Researchers are still learning how the disease is inherited and which genes are involved.\\n                \\nGenerally, a child must inherit faulty genes from both parents to have PCD. These genes affect how cilia grow and function. Faulty genes may cause the cilia to be the wrong size or shape or move in the wrong way. Sometimes the cilia are missing altogether.\\n                \\nNo single faulty gene causes all cases of PCD. Rather, many genes are associated with the disease.\\n                \\nIf a child inherits a faulty gene (or genes) from only one parent, he or she may be a \"PCD carrier.\" Carriers usually have no symptoms of PCD. However, carriers can pass faulty PCD genes on to their children.\\n                \\nThe symptoms and severity of PCD vary from person to person. If you or your child has the disease, you may have serious sinus, ear, and/or lung infections. If the disease is mild, it may not show up until the teen or adult years.\\n                \\nThe symptoms and severity of PCD also vary over time. Sometimes you may have few symptoms. Other times, your symptoms may become more severe.\\n                \\nSome people who have PCD have a condition called situs inversus (SI-tus in-VER-sus). This is a condition in which the internal organs (for example, the heart, stomach, spleen, liver, and gallbladder) are in opposite positions from where they normally are.\\n                \\nA correct and early diagnosis of PCD is very important. It will allow you or your child to get the proper treatment to keep your airways and lungs as healthy as possible. An early diagnosis and proper treatment also can prevent or delay lung damage.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nMany people who have PCD have normal lifespans. However, about 25 percent of people who have the disease may develop respiratory failure, a life-threatening condition. A small number of people who have PCD need lung transplants.\\n                \\nScientists continue to study the faulty genes that cause PCD. Further studies of the disease will likely lead to earlier diagnoses, better treatments, and improved outcomes.', 'Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare, inherited disease. \"Inherited\" means the disease is passed from parents to children through genes.
