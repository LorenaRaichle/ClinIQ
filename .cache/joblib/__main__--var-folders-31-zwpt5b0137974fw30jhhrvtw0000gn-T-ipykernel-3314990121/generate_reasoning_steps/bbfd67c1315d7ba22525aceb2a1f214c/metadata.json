The range and and severity of signs and symptoms in individuals with Kuskokwim disease can vary, even among siblings. Affected individuals usually have congenital contractures, especially of lower extremities, which progress during childhood and persist for the lifetime of the individual. However, not all individuals with the condition have contractures at birth. The severity of contractures can be very asymmetrical in any given individual. The knees and elbows are often affected, and skeletal abnormalities of the spine, pelvis, and feet also commonly occur. Muscle atrophy of limbs with contractures and displacement of kneecaps (patellae) have also been reported. Milder skeletal features are common. Vertebral features may include spondylolisthesis, mild to moderate scoliosis, and/or lordosis. Many affected individuals have had several low-energy fractures. Other skeletal abnormalities that have been reported include bunions (hallux valgus), \"flat feet\" (plano valgus feet), and clubfoot (talipes equinovarus). Development and arrangement of the teeth (dentition) are normal. Although some individuals with full bilateral contractures of the knees can move about by duck walking (sitting with buttocks on their heels) or by knee walking (moving on their knees with their lower legs drawn up behind them to their buttocks), most affected individuals are treated with leg braces and/or surgery in childhood and can walk upright. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Kuskokwim disease. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Gait disturbance 90% Limitation of joint mobility 90% Patellar aplasia 90% Talipes 50% Abnormal form of the vertebral bodies 7.5% Abnormality of the clavicle 7.5% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the radius 7.5% Melanocytic nevus 7.5% Scoliosis 7.5% Autosomal recessive inheritance - Skeletal muscle atrophy - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'How might Kuskokwim disease be treated? Treatment for Kuskokwim disease depends on the nature and severity of signs and symptoms in each affected individual. There is currently no completely successful approach to treat arthrogryposis. The goals of treatment may include lower-limb alignment, establishing stability for ambulation (moving about) and improving upper-limb function for self-care. Many individuals with Kuskokwim disease are treated with leg braces and/or surgery and eventually are able to walk upright.', 'Hardikar syndrome is a very rare multiple congenital malformation syndrome characterized by obstructive liver and kidney disease, intestinal malrotation, genitourinary abnormalities, cleft lip and palate, pigmentary retinopathy (breakdown of the light-sensing tissue at the back of the eye), and congenital heart defects. Only four cases have been reported in the medical literature. The cause of this condition remains unknown, although an overlap with Kabuki syndrome and Alagille syndrome have been debated.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Hardikar syndrome?
