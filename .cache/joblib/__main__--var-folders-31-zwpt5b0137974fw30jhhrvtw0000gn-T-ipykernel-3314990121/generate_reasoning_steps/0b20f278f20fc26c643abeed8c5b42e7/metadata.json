The two main treatments for MPS I are enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and bone marrow transplant. Both of these treatments work by replacing the missing IDUA enzyme. A drug called laronidase or Aldurazyme is the enzyme replacement therapy for MPS I. Treatment with laronidase can improve problems with breathing, growth, the bones, joints and heart. However, this treatment is not expected to treat problems with mental development because laronidase cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. A bone marrow transplant is another treatment option that provides the person with MPS I with cells that can produce the IDUA enyzme. A bone marrow transplant can stop the progression of neurological problems.', 'Genoa syndrome is a rare condition that primarily affects the brain and skull. Babies with this condition are generally born with semilobar holoprosencephaly, a disorder caused by failure of the developing brain to sufficiently divide into the double lobes of the cerebral hemispheres. They later develop craniosynostosis (the premature closure of one or more of the fibrous joints between the bones of the skull before brain growth is complete). Genoa syndrome also appears to be associated with other skeletal abnormalities, including those of the hands, and distinctive facial features. The underlying genetic cause of the condition is currently unknown. Some reports suggest that Genoa syndrome may be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is supportive and based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Genoa syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Genoa syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Familial dilated cardiomyopathy?
