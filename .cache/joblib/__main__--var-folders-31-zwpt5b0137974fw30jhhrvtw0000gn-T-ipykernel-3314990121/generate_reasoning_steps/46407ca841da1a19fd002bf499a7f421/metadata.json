The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Baraitser-Winter syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Duplication of phalanx of hallux 5% Highly arched eyebrow 5% Microphthalmia 5% Oral cleft 5% Retrognathia 5% Ventriculomegaly 5% Abnormality of metabolism/homeostasis - Agenesis of corpus callosum - Anteverted nares - Aortic valve stenosis - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Bicuspid aortic valve - Chorioretinal coloboma - Cryptorchidism - Hypertelorism - Intellectual disability - Iris coloboma - Lissencephaly - Long palpebral fissure - Long philtrum - Low posterior hairline - Low-set ears - Microcephaly - Micropenis - Muscular hypotonia - Overfolded helix - Pachygyria - Patent ductus arteriosus - Pointed chin - Postnatal growth retardation - Prominent epicanthal folds - Ptosis - Seizures - Sensorineural hearing impairment - Short neck - Short nose - Short stature - Trigonocephaly - Wide mouth - Wide nasal bridge - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Young syndrome is a condition whose signs and symptoms may be similar to those seen in cystic fibrosis, including bronchiectasis, sinusitis, and obstructive azoospermia (a condition in which sperm are produced but do not mix with the rest of the ejaculatory fluid due to a physical obstruction, resulting in nonexistent levels of sperm in semen) . The condition is usually diagnosed in middle-aged men who undergo evaluation for infertility. Although the exact cause has not been identified, it is believed to be a genetic condition. At this time, there is no known effective treatment or cure for Young syndrome.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Young syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Young syndrome.

In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', \"Cancer of the appendix is very rare and is typically found incidentally during appendectomies, in about 1% of the cases. According to a report published by the National Cancer Institute, using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, appendix cancer account for about 0.4% of gastrointestinal tumors. There are several subytpes. The most common is the carcinoid type (66% of the total), with cyst-adenocarcinoma accounting for 20% and adenocarcinoma accounting for 10%. Then there are the rare forms of cancers which include adenocarcinoid, signet ring, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, ganglioneuroma, and pheochromocytoma. Benign primary tumors are mainly mucinous epithelial neoplasms, also called adenomas, cystadenoma, and benign neoplastic mucocele. Adenocarcinoma of the appendix is a epithelial cancer of the appendix. The term 'epithelium' refers to cells that line hollow organs and glands and those that make up the outer surface of the body. Epithelial cells help to protect or enclose organs. Some produce mucus or other secretions. Types of adenocarcinoma of the appendix include mucinous adenocarcinoma, non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and signet cell carcinoma of appendix (which is the rarer involving only 4% of all the subtypes of appendix cancer).\"]}"}, "time": 1746283461.211754}
