Avoid or eat less of the foods that cause your gas symptoms.', '- Gas is air in the digestive tract.  - Everyone has gas. Burping and passing gas are normal.  - Gas in the digestive tract is usually caused by swallowing air and the breakdown of certain foods in the large intestine.  - Most foods that contain carbohydrates can cause gas.  - Foods that cause gas for one person may not cause gas for someone else.  - The most common symptoms of gas are burping, passing gas, bloating, and abdominal pain or discomfort.  - Swallowing less air and changing what you eat can help prevent or reduce gas.  - Some over-the-counter medicines can help reduce gas.', 'Gallstones are hard particles that develop in the gallbladder. The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ located in the upper right abdomenthe area between the chest and hipsbelow the liver.\\n                \\nGallstones can range in size from a grain of sand to a golf ball. The gallbladder can develop a single large gallstone, hundreds of tiny stones, or both small and large stones. Gallstones can cause sudden pain in the upper right abdomen. This pain, called a gallbladder attack or biliary colic, occurs when gallstones block the ducts of the biliary tract.', 'The biliary tract consists of the gallbladder and the bile ducts. The bile ducts carry bile and other digestive enzymes from the liver and pancreas to the duodenumthe fi rst part of the small intestine.\\n                \\nThe liver produces bilea fl uid that carries toxins and waste products out of the body and helps the body digest fats and the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. Bile mostly consists of cholesterol, bile salts, and bilirubin. Bilirubin, a reddish-yellow substance, forms when hemoglobin from red blood cells breaks down. Most bilirubin is excreted through bile.\\n                \\n\\n                \\n\\n                \\nThe bile ducts of the biliary tract include the hepatic ducts, the common bile duct, the pancreatic duct, and the cystic duct. The gallbladder stores bile. Eating signals the gallbladder to contract and empty bile through the cystic duct and common bile duct into the duodenum to mix with food.']}"}, "time": 1746283484.72433}
