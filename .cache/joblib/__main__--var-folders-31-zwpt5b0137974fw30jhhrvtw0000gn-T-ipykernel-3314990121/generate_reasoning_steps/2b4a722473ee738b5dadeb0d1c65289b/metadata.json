They are located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. Every day, the two kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine, composed of wastes and extra fluid. Children produce less urine than adults and the amount produced depends on their age. The urine flows from the kidneys to the bladder through tubes called ureters. The bladder stores urine. When the bladder empties, urine flows out of the body through a tube called the urethra, located at the bottom of the bladder.', 'The most common cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome in children is an Escherichia coli (E. coli) infection of the digestive system. The digestive system is made up of the gastrointestinal, or GI, tracta series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anusand other organs that help the body break down and absorb food.\\n                \\nNormally, harmless strains, or types, of E. coli are found in the intestines and are an important part of digestion. However, if a child becomes infected with the O157:H7 strain of E. coli, the bacteria will lodge in the digestive tract and produce toxins that can enter the bloodstream. The toxins travel through the bloodstream and can destroy the red blood cells. E.coli O157:H7 can be found in\\n                \\n- undercooked meat, most often ground beef  - unpasteurized, or raw, milk  - unwashed, contaminated raw fruits and vegetables  - contaminated juice  - contaminated swimming pools or lakes\\n                \\nLess common causes, sometimes called atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, can include\\n                \\n- taking certain medications, such as chemotherapy  - having other viral or bacterial infections  - inheriting a certain type of hemolytic uremicsyndrome that runs in families\\n                \\nMore information about foodborne illnesses and the digestive system is provided in the NIDDK health topic, foodborne illnesses.', \"A child with hemolytic uremic syndrome may develop signs and symptoms similar to those seen with gastroenteritisan inflammation of the lining of the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine such as\\n                \\n- vomiting  - bloody diarrhea  - abdominal pain  - fever and chills  - headache\\n                \\nAs the infection progresses, the toxins released in the intestine begin to destroy red blood cells. When the red blood cells are destroyed, the child may experience the signs and symptoms of anemiaa condition in which red blood cells are fewer or smaller than normal, which prevents the body's cells from getting enough oxygen.\\n                \\nSigns and symptoms of anemia may include\\n                \\n- fatigue, or feeling tired  - weakness  - fainting  - paleness\\n                \\nAs the damaged red blood cells clog the glomeruli, the kidneys may become damaged and make less urine. When damaged, the kidneys work harder to remove wastes and extra fluid from the blood, sometimes leading to acute kidney injury.\\n                \\nOther signs and symptoms of hemolytic uremic syndrome may include bruising and seizures.\\n                \\nWhen hemolytic uremic syndrome causes acute kidney injury, a child may have the following signs and symptoms:\\n                \\n- edemaswelling, most often in the legs, feet, or ankles and less often in the hands or face  - albuminuriawhen a child's urine has high levels of albumin, the main protein in the blood  - decreased urine output  - hypoalbuminemiawhen a child's blood has low levels of albumin  - blood in the urine\\n                \\n\\n                \\nSeek Immediate Care   Parents or caretakers should seek immediate care for a child experiencing any urgent symptoms, such as   - unusual bleeding   - swelling   - extreme fatigue   - decreased urine output   - unexplained bruises\", \"A health care provider diagnoses hemolytic uremic syndrome with\\n                \\n- a medical and family history  - a physical exam  - urine tests  - a blood test  - a stool test  - kidney biopsy\\n                \\nMedical and Family History\\n                \\nTaking a medical and family history is one of the first things a health care provider may do to help diagnose hemolytic uremic syndrome.\\n                \\nPhysical Exam\\n                \\nA physical exam may help diagnose hemolytic uremic syndrome. During a physical exam, a health care provider most often\\n                \\n- examines a child's body  - taps on specific areas of the child's body\\n                \\nUrine Tests\\n                \\nA health care provider may order the following urine tests to help determine if a child has kidney damage from hemolytic uremic syndrome.\\n                \\nDipstick test for albumin. A dipstick test performed on a urine sample can detect the presence of albumin in the urine, which could mean kidney damage. The child or caretaker collects a urine sample in a special container in a health care provider's office or a commercial facility. For the test, a nurse or technician places a strip of chemically treated paper, called a dipstick, into the child's urine sample. Patches on the dipstick change color when albumin is present in the urine.\\n                \\nUrine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. A health care provider uses this measurement to estimate the amount of albumin passed into the urine over a 24-hour period. The child provides a urine sample during an appointment with the health care provider. Creatinine is a waste product that is filtered in the kidneys and passed in the urine. A high urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio indicates that the kidneys are leaking large amounts of albumin into the urine.\\n                \\nBlood Test\\n                \\nA blood test involves drawing blood at a health care provider's office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. A health care provider will test the blood sample to\\n                \\n- estimate how much blood the kidneys filter eachminute, called the estimated glomerular filtrationrate, or eGFR. The test results help the healthcare provider determine the amount of kidneydamage from hemolytic uremic syndrome.  - check red blood cell and platelet levels.  - check for liver and kidney function.  - assess protein levels in the blood.\\n                \\nStool Test\\n                \\nA stool test is the analysis of a sample of stool. The health care provider will give the child's parent or caretaker a container for catching and storing the stool. The parent or caretaker returns the sample to the health care provider or a commercial facility that will send the sample to a lab for analysis. Stool tests can show the presence of E. coli O157:H7.\\n                \\nKidney Biopsy\\n                \\nBiopsy is a procedure that involves taking a small piece of kidney tissue for examination with a microscope. A health care provider performs the biopsy in an outpatient center or a hospital. The health care provider will give the child light sedation and local anesthetic; however, in some cases, the child will require general anesthesia. A pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseasesexamines the tissue in a lab. The pathologist looks for signs of kidney disease and infection. The test can help diagnose hemolytic uremic syndrome.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283484.221638}
