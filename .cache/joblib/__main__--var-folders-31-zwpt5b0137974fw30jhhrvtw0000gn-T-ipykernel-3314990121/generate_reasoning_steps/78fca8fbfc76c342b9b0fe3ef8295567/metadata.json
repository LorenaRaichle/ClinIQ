The cells in your body need oxygen to work and grow. During a normal day, you breathe nearly 25,000 times. People with lung disease have difficulty breathing. Millions of people in the U.S. have lung disease. If all types of lung disease are lumped together, it is the number three killer in the United States.    The term lung disease refers to many disorders affecting the lungs, such as asthma, COPD, infections like influenza, pneumonia and tuberculosis, lung cancer, and many other breathing problems. Some lung diseases can lead to respiratory failure.    Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health\", \"Lymphoma is a cancer of a part of the immune system called the lymph system. There are many types of lymphoma. One type is Hodgkin disease. The rest are called non-Hodgkin lymphomas.    Non-Hodgkin lymphomas begin when a type of white blood cell, called a T cell or B cell, becomes abnormal. The cell divides again and again, making more and more abnormal cells. These abnormal cells can spread to almost any other part of the body. Most of the time, doctors don't know why a person gets non-Hodgkin lymphoma. You are at increased risk if you have a weakened immune system or have certain types of infections.    Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can cause many symptoms, such as        - Swollen, painless lymph nodes in the neck, armpits or groin    - Unexplained weight loss     - Fever     - Soaking night sweats     - Coughing, trouble breathing or chest pain     - Weakness and tiredness that don't go away     - Pain, swelling or a feeling of fullness in the abdomen        Your doctor will diagnose lymphoma with a physical exam, blood tests, a chest x-ray, and a biopsy. Treatments include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, biological therapy, or therapy to remove proteins from the blood. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells. Biologic therapy boosts your body's own ability to fight cancer. If you don't have symptoms, you may not need treatment right away. This is called watchful waiting.    NIH: National Cancer Institute\", 'A collapsed lung happens when air enters the pleural space, the area between the lung and the chest wall. If it is a total collapse, it is called pneumothorax. If only part of the lung is affected, it is called atelectasis.    Causes of a collapsed lung include       - Lung diseases such as pneumonia or lung cancer    - Being on a breathing machine    - Surgery on the chest or abdomen    - A blocked airway       If only a small area of the lung is affected, you may not have symptoms. If a large area is affected, you may feel short of breath and have a rapid heart rate.    A chest x-ray can tell if you have it. Treatment depends on the underlying cause.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', \"A congenital heart defect is a problem with the structure of the heart. It is present at birth. Congenital heart defects are the most common type of birth defect. The defects can involve the walls of the heart, the valves of the heart, and the arteries and veins near the heart. They can disrupt the normal flow of blood through the heart. The blood flow can slow down, go in the wrong direction or to the wrong place, or be blocked completely.    Doctors use a physical exam and special heart tests to diagnose congenital heart defects. They often find severe defects during pregnancy or soon after birth. Signs and symptoms of severe defects in newborns include       - Rapid breathing    - Cyanosis - a bluish tint to the skin, lips, and fingernails    - Fatigue    - Poor blood circulation       Many congenital heart defects cause few or no signs and symptoms. They are often not diagnosed until children are older.    Many children with congenital heart defects don't need treatment, but others do. Treatment can include medicines, catheter procedures, surgery, and heart transplants. The treatment depends on the type of the defect, how severe it is, and a child's age, size, and general health.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\"]}"}, "time": 1746283466.74069}
