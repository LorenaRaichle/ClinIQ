Located in the front of the neck below the larynx, or voice box, it has two lobes, one on each side of the windpipe. The thyroid is one of the glands that make up the endocrine system. The glands of the endocrine system produce and store hormones and release them into the bloodstream. The hormones then travel through the body and direct the activity of the bodys cells.\\n                \\nThe thyroid gland makes two thyroid hormones, triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). T3 is made from T4 and is the more active hormone, directly affecting the tissues. Thyroid hormones affect metabolism, brain development, breathing, heart and nervous system functions, body temperature, muscle strength, skin dryness, menstrual cycles, weight, and cholesterol levels.', 'Hypothyroidism has several causes, including\\n                \\n- Hashimotos disease  - thyroiditis, or inflammation of the thyroid  - congenital hypothyroidism, or hypothyroidism that is present at birth  - surgical removal of part or all of the thyroid  - radiation treatment of the thyroid  - some medications\\n                \\nLess commonly, hypothyroidism is caused by too much or too little iodine in the diet or by abnormalities of the pituitary gland.\\n                \\nHashimotos Disease\\n                \\nHashimotos disease, also called chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in the United States.1 Hashimotos disease is a form of chronic inflammation of the thyroid gland. Hashimotos disease is also an autoimmune disorder.\\n                \\nNormally, the immune system protects the body against foreign invaderssuch as viruses and bacteriathat can cause illness. But in autoimmune diseases, the immune system attacks the bodys own cells and organs. With Hashimotos disease, the immune system attacks the thyroid, causing inflammation and interfering with its ability to produce thyroid hormones.\\n                \\nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Hashimotos Disease.\\n                \\nThyroiditis\\n                \\nThyroiditis causes stored thyroid hormone to leak out of the thyroid gland. At first, the leakage raises hormone levels in the blood, leading to hyperthyroidismwhen thyroid hormone levels are too highthat lasts for 1 or 2 months. Most people then develop hypothyroidism before the thyroid is completely healed.\\n                \\nSeveral types of thyroiditis can cause hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism:\\n                \\n- Subacute thyroiditis. This condition involves painful inflammation and enlargement of the thyroid. Experts are not sure what causes subacute thyroiditis, but it may be related to a viral or bacterial infection. The condition usually goes away on its own in a few months.  - Postpartum thyroiditis. This type of thyroiditis develops after a woman gives birth. For more information, see the section titled What happens with pregnancy and thyroid conditions?  - Silent thyroiditis. This type of thyroiditis is called silent because it is painless, as is postpartum thyroiditis, even though the thyroid may be enlarged. Like postpartum thyroiditis, silent thyroiditis is probably an autoimmune condition and sometimes develops into permanent hypothyroidism.\\n                \\nCongenital Hypothyroidism\\n                \\nSome babies are born with a thyroid that is not fully developed or does not function properly. If untreated, congenital hypothyroidism can lead to mental retardation and growth failure. Early treatment can prevent these complications, so most newborns in the United States are screened for hypothyroidism.\\n                \\nSurgical Removal of the Thyroid\\n                \\nWhen part of the thyroid is removed, the remaining part may produce normal amounts of thyroid hormone, but some people who have this surgery develop hypothyroidism. Removal of the entire thyroid always results in hypothyroidism.\\n                \\nPart or all of the thyroid may be surgically removed as a treatment for\\n                \\n- hyperthyroidism  - a large goiter, which is an enlarged thyroid that may cause the neck to appear swollen and can interfere with normal breathing and swallowing  - thyroid nodules, which are noncancerous tumors, called adenomas, or lumps in the thyroid that can produce excess thyroid hormone  - thyroid cancer\\n                \\nRadiation Treatment of the Thyroid\\n                \\nRadioactive iodine, a common treatment for hyperthyroidism, gradually destroys the cells of the thyroid. Most people who receive radioactive iodine treatment eventually develop hypothyroidism. People with Hodgkins disease, other lymphomas, and head or neck cancers are treated with radiation, which can also damage the thyroid.\\n                \\nMedications\\n                \\nSome drugs can interfere with thyroid hormone production and lead to hypothyroidism, including\\n                \\n- amiodarone, a heart medication  - interferon alpha, a cancer medication  - lithium, a bipolar disorder medication  - interleukin-2, a kidney cancer medication', 'Hypothyroidism has many symptoms that can vary from person to person. Some common symptoms of hypothyroidism are\\n                \\n- fatigue  - weight gain  - a puffy face  - cold intolerance  - joint and muscle pain  - constipation  - dry skin  - dry, thinning hair  - decreased sweating  - heavy or irregular menstrual periods and impaired fertility  - depression  - slowed heart rate\\n                \\nHowever, hypothyroidism develops slowly, so many people dont notice symptoms of the disease.\\n                \\nSymptoms more specific to Hashimotos disease are a goiter and a feeling of fullness in the throat.\\n                \\nHypothyroidism can contribute to high cholesterol, so people with high cholesterol should be tested for hypothyroidism. Rarely, severe, untreated hypothyroidism may lead to myxedema coma, an extreme form of hypothyroidism in which the bodys functions slow to the point that it becomes life threatening. Myxedema requires immediate medical treatment.', 'Many symptoms of hypothyroidism are the same as those of other diseases, so hypothyroidism usually cannot be diagnosed based on symptoms alone. With suspected hypothyroidism, health care providers take a medical history and perform a thorough physical examination. Health care providers may then use several blood tests to confirm a diagnosis of hypothyroidism and find its cause:\\n                \\nTSH test. The ultrasensitive TSH test is usually the first test a health care provider performs. This test detects even tiny amounts of TSH in the blood and is the most accurate measure of thyroid activity available. Generally, a TSH reading above normal means a person has hypothyroidism and a reading below normal means a person has hyperthyroidism.\\n                \\nMildly elevated TSH without symptoms indicates subclinical hypothyroidism. Some health care providers treat subclinical hypothyroidism immediately. Others prefer to leave it untreated but monitor their patients for signs that the condition is worsening.\\n                \\nHealth care providers may conduct additional tests to help confirm the diagnosis or determine the cause of hypothyroidism.\\n                \\nT4 test. This test measures the actual amount of circulating thyroid hormone in the blood. In hypothyroidism, the level of T4 in the blood is lower than normal.\\n                \\nThyroid autoantibody test. This test looks for the presence of thyroid autoantibodies. Most people with Hashimotos disease have these antibodies, but people whose hypothyroidism is caused by other conditions do not.\\n                \\nMore information about testing for thyroid problems is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Thyroid Tests.']}"}, "time": 1746283485.410051}
