However, sometimes the cause is unknown. Other treatments, such as medicines and a vaporizer, can help relieve the cough itself.\\n                \\nTreating the Cause of a Cough\\n                \\nAcute and Subacute Cough\\n                \\nAn acute cough lasts less than 3 weeks. Common causes of an acute cough are a common cold or other upper respiratory infections. Examples of other upper respiratory infections include the flu, pneumonia, and whooping cough. An acute cough usually goes away after the illness that caused it is over.\\n                \\nA subacute cough lasts 3 to 8 weeks. This type of cough remains even after a cold or other respiratory infection is over.\\n                \\nStudies show that antibiotics and cold medicines can\\'t cure a cold. However, your doctor may prescribe medicines to treat another cause of an acute or subacute cough. For example, antibiotics may be given for pneumonia.\\n                \\nChronic Cough\\n                \\nA chronic cough lasts more than 8 weeks. Common causes of a chronic cough are upper airway cough syndrome (UACS), asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).\\n                \\n\"UACS\" is a term used to describe conditions that inflame the upper airways and cause a cough. Examples include sinus infections and allergies. These conditions can cause mucus (a slimy substance) to run down your throat from the back of your nose. This is called postnasal drip.\\n                \\nIf you have a sinus infection, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics. He or she also may suggest you use a medicine that you spray into your nose. If allergies are causing your cough, your doctor may advise you to avoid the substances that you\\'re allergic to (allergens) if possible.\\n                \\nIf you have asthma, try to avoid irritants and allergens that make your asthma worse. Take your asthma medicines as your doctor prescribes.\\n                \\nGERD occurs if acid from your stomach backs up into your throat. Your doctor may prescribe a medicine to reduce acid in your stomach. You also may be able to relieve GERD symptoms by waiting 3 to 4 hours after a meal before lying down, and by sleeping with your head raised.\\n                \\nSmoking also can cause a chronic cough. If you smoke, it\\'s important to quit. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.\\n                \\nMany hospitals have programs that help people quit smoking, or hospital staff can refer you to a program. The Health Topics Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\'s \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart\" booklet have more information about how to quit smoking.\\n                \\nOther causes of a chronic cough include respiratory infections, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and heart failure. Treatments for these causes may include medicines, procedures, and other therapies. Treatment also may include avoiding irritants and allergens and quitting smoking.\\n                \\nIf your chronic cough is due to a medicine you\\'re taking, your doctor may prescribe a different medicine.\\n                \\nTreating the Cough Rather Than the Cause\\n                \\nCoughing is important because it helps clear your airways of irritants, such as smoke and mucus (a slimy substance). Coughing also helps prevent infections.\\n                \\nCough medicines usually are used only when the cause of the cough is unknown and the cough causes a lot of discomfort.\\n                \\nMedicines can help control a cough and make it easier to cough up mucus. Your doctor may recommend medicines such as:\\n                \\nPrescription cough suppressants, also called antitussives. These medicines can help relieve a cough. However, they\\'re usually used when nothing else works. No evidence shows that over-the-counter cough suppressants relieve a cough.\\n                \\nExpectorants. These medicines may loosen mucus, making it easier to cough up.\\n                \\nBronchodilators. These medicines relax your airways.\\n                \\nOther treatments also may relieve an irritated throat and loosen mucus. Examples include using a cool-mist humidifier or steam vaporizer and drinking enough fluids. Examples of fluids are water, soup, and juice. Ask your doctor how much fluid you need.\\n                \\nCough in Children\\n                \\nNo evidence shows that cough and cold medicines help children recover more quickly from colds. These medicines can even harm children. Talk with your child\\'s doctor about your child\\'s cough and how to treat it.', 'Metabolicsyndrome is the name for a group of risk factors that raises your risk for heart disease and other health problems, such as diabetes and stroke.\\n                \\nThe term \"metabolic\" refers to the biochemical processes involved in the body\\'s normal functioning. Risk factors are traits, conditions, or habits that increase your chance of developing a disease.\\n                \\nIn this article, \"heart disease\" refers to coronary heart disease (CHD). CHD is a condition in which a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside the coronary (heart) arteries.\\n                \\nPlaque hardens and narrows the arteries, reducing blood flow to your heart muscle. This can lead to chest pain, a heart attack, heart damage, or even death.\\n                \\nMetabolic Risk Factors\\n                \\nThe five conditions described below are metabolic risk factors. You can have any one of these risk factors by itself, but they tend to occur together. You must have at least three metabolic risk factors to be diagnosed with metabolic syndrome.\\n                \\nA large waistline. This also is called abdominal obesity or \"having an apple shape.\" Excess fat in the stomach area is a greater risk factor for heart disease than excess fat in other parts of the body, such as on the hips.\\n                \\nA high triglyceride level (or you\\'re on medicine to treat high triglycerides). Triglycerides are a type of fat found in the blood.\\n                \\nA low HDL cholesterol level (or you\\'re on medicine to treat low HDL cholesterol). HDL sometimes is called \"good\" cholesterol. This is because it helps remove cholesterol from your arteries. A low HDL cholesterol level raises your risk for heart disease.\\n                \\nHigh blood pressure (or you\\'re on medicine to treat high blood pressure). Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of your arteries as your heart pumps blood. If this pressure rises and stays high over time, it can damage your heart and lead to plaque buildup.\\n                \\nHigh fasting blood sugar (or you\\'re on medicine to treat high blood sugar). Mildly high blood sugar may be an early sign of diabetes.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nYour risk for heart disease, diabetes, and stroke increases with the number of metabolic risk factors you have. The risk of having metabolic syndrome is closely linked to overweight and obesity and a lack of physical activity.\\n                \\nInsulin resistance also may increase your risk for metabolic syndrome. Insulin resistance is a condition in which the body cant use its insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone that helps move blood sugar into cells where its used for energy. Insulin resistance can lead to high blood sugar levels, and its closely linked to overweight and obesity.Genetics (ethnicity and family history) and older age are other factors that may play a role in causing metabolic syndrome.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nMetabolic syndrome is becoming more common due to a rise in obesity rates among adults. In the future, metabolic syndrome may overtake smoking as the leading risk factor for heart disease.\\n                \\nIt is possible to prevent or delay metabolic syndrome, mainly with lifestyle changes. A healthy lifestyle is a lifelong commitment. Successfully controlling metabolic syndrome requires long-term effort and teamwork with your health care providers.', \"Metabolic syndrome has several causes that act together. You can control some of the causes, such as overweight and obesity, an inactive lifestyle, and insulin resistance.\\n                \\nYou can't control other factors that may play a role in causing metabolic syndrome, such as growing older. Your risk for metabolic syndrome increases with age.\\n                \\nYou also can't control genetics (ethnicity and family history), which may play a role in causing the condition. For example, genetics can increase your risk for insulin resistance, which can lead to metabolic syndrome.\\n                \\nPeople who have metabolic syndrome often have two other conditions: excessive blood clotting and constant, low-grade inflammation throughout the body. Researchers don't know whether these conditions cause metabolic syndrome or worsen it.\\n                \\nResearchers continue to study conditions that may play a role in metabolic syndrome, such as:\\n                \\nA fatty liver (excess triglycerides and other fats in the liver)\\n                \\nPolycystic ovarian syndrome (a tendency to develop cysts on the ovaries)\\n                \\nGallstones\\n                \\nBreathing problems during sleep (such as sleep apnea)\", 'People at greatest risk for metabolic syndrome have these underlying causes:\\n                \\nAbdominal obesity (a large waistline)\\n                \\nAn inactive lifestyle\\n                \\nInsulin resistance\\n                \\nSome people are at risk for metabolic syndrome because they take medicines that cause weight gain or changes in blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and blood sugar levels. These medicines most often are used to treat inflammation, allergies, HIV, and depression and other types of mental illness.\\n                \\nPopulations Affected\\n                \\nSome racial and ethnic groups in the United States are at higher risk for metabolic syndrome than others. Mexican Americans have the highest rate of metabolic syndrome, followed by whites and blacks.\\n                \\nOther groups at increased risk for metabolic syndrome include:\\n                \\nPeople who have a personal history of diabetes\\n                \\nPeople who have a sibling or parent who hasdiabetes\\n                \\nWomen when compared with men\\n                \\nWomen who have a personal history of polycystic ovarian syndrome (a tendency to develop cysts on the ovaries)\\n                \\nHeart Disease Risk\\n                \\nMetabolic syndrome increases your risk for coronary heart disease. Other risk factors, besides metabolic syndrome, also increase your risk for heart disease. For example, a high LDL (bad) cholesterol level and smoking are major risk factors for heart disease. For details about all of the risk factors for heart disease, go to the Coronary Heart Disease Risk Factors HealthTopic.\\n                \\nEven if you dont have metabolic syndrome, you should find out your short-term risk for heart disease. The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) divides short-term heart disease risk into four categories. Your risk category depends on which risk factors you have and how many you have.\\n                \\nYour risk factors are used to calculate your 10-year risk of developing heart disease. The NCEP has an online calculator that you can use to estimate your 10-year risk of having a heart attack.\\n                \\nHigh risk: Youre in this category if you already have heart disease or diabetes, or if your 10-year risk score is more than 20 percent.\\n                \\nModerately high risk: Youre in this category if you have two or more risk factors and your 10-year risk score is 10 percent to 20 percent.\\n                \\nModerate risk: Youre in this category if you have two or more risk factors and your 10-year risk score is less than 10 percent.\\n                \\nLower risk: Youre in this category if you have zero or one risk factor.\\n                \\nEven if your 10-year risk score isnt high, metabolic syndrome will increase your risk for coronary heart disease over time.']}"}, "time": 1746283466.486007}
