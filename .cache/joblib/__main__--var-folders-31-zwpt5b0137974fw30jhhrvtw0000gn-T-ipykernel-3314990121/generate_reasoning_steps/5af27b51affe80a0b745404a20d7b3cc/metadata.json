The immune system normally protects people from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances.\\n                \\nAutoimmune hepatitis is a serious condition that may worsen over time if not treated. Autoimmune hepatitis can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. Cirrhosis occurs when scar tissue replaces healthy liver tissue and blocks the normal flow of blood through the liver. Liver failure occurs when the liver stops working properly.\", \"Autoimmune diseases are disorders in which the body's immune system attacks the body's own cells and organs with proteins called autoantibodies; this process is called autoimmunity.\\n                \\nThe body's immune system normally makes large numbers of proteins called antibodies to help the body fight off infections. In some cases, however, the body makes autoantibodies. Certain environmental triggers can lead to autoimmunity. Environmental triggers are things originating outside the body, such as bacteria, viruses, toxins, and medications.\", 'A combination of autoimmunity, environmental triggers, and a genetic predisposition can lead to autoimmune hepatitis.', \"Autoimmune hepatitis is classified into several types. Type 1 autoimmune hepatitis is the most common form in North America. Type 1 can occur at any age; however, it most often starts in adolescence or young adulthood. About 70 percent of people with type 1 autoimmune hepatitis are female.1\\n                \\nPeople with type 1 autoimmune hepatitis commonly have other autoimmune disorders, such as\\n                \\n- celiac disease, an autoimmune disease in which people cannot tolerate gluten because it damages the lining of their small intestine and prevents absorption of nutrients  - Crohn's disease, which causes inflammation and irritation of any part of the digestive tract  - Graves' disease, the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United States  - Hashimoto's disease, also called chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis or autoimmune thyroiditis, a form of chronic inflammation of the thyroid gland  - proliferative glomerulonephritis, or inflammation of the glomeruli, which are tiny clusters of looping blood vessels in the kidneys  - primary sclerosing cholangitis, which causes irritation, scarring, and narrowing of the bile ducts inside and outside the liver  - rheumatoid arthritis, which causes pain, swelling, stiffness, and loss of function in the joints  - Sjgren's syndrome, which causes dryness in the mouth and eyes  - systemic lupus erythematosus, which causes kidney inflammation called lupus nephritis  - type 1 diabetes, a condition characterized by high blood glucose, also called blood sugar, levels caused by a total lack of insulin  - ulcerative colitis, a chronic disease that causes inflammation and sores, called ulcers, in the inner lining of the large intestine\\n                \\nType 2 autoimmune hepatitis is less common and occurs more often in children than adults.1 People with type 2 can also have any of the above autoimmune disorders.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283485.3755572}
