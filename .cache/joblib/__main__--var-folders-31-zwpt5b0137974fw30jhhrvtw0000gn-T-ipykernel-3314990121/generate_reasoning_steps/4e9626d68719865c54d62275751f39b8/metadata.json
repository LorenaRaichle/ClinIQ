Surfactant is a liquid that coats the inside of the lungs.\\n                \\nA fetus's lungs start making surfactant during the third trimester of pregnancy (weeks 26 through labor and delivery). The substance coats the insides of the air sacs in the lungs. This helps keep the lungs open so breathing can occur after birth.\\n                \\nWithout enough surfactant, the lungs will likely collapse when the infant exhales (breathes out). The infant then has to work harder to breathe. He or she might not be able to get enough oxygen to support the body's organs.\\n                \\nSome full-term infants develop RDS because they have faulty genes that affect how their bodies make surfactant.\", \"Certain factors may increase the risk that your infant will have respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). These factors include:\\n                \\nPremature delivery. The earlier your baby is born, the greater his or her risk for RDS. Most cases of RDS occur in babies born before 28 weeks of pregnancy.\\n                \\nStress during your baby's delivery, especially if you lose a lot of blood.\\n                \\nInfection.\\n                \\nYour having diabetes.\\n                \\nYour baby also is at greater risk for RDS if you require an emergency cesarean delivery (C-section) before your baby is full term. You may need an emergency C-section because of a condition, such as a detached placenta, that puts you or your infant at risk.\\n                \\nPlanned C-sections that occur before a baby's lungs have fully matured also can increase the risk of RDS. Your doctor can do tests before delivery that show whether it's likely that your baby's lungs are fully developed. These tests assess the age of the fetus or lung maturity.\", \"Signs and symptoms of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) usually occur at birth or within the first few hours that follow. They include:\\n                \\nRapid, shallow breathing\\n                \\nSharp pulling in of the chest below and between the ribs with each breath\\n                \\nGrunting sounds\\n                \\nFlaring of the nostrils\\n                \\nThe infant also may have pauses in breathing that last for a few seconds. This condition is called apnea (AP-ne-ah).\\n                \\nRespiratory Distress Syndrome Complications\\n                \\nDepending on the severity of an infant's RDS, he or she may develop other medical problems.\\n                \\nLung Complications\\n                \\nLung complications may include a collapsed lung (atelectasis), leakage of air from the lung into the chest cavity (pneumothorax), and bleeding in the lung (hemorrhage).\\n                \\nSome of the life-saving treatments used for RDS may cause bronchopulmonary dysplasia, another breathing disorder.\\n                \\nBlood and Blood Vessel Complications\\n                \\nInfants who have RDS may develop sepsis, an infection of the bloodstream. This infection can be life threatening.\\n                \\nLack of oxygen may prevent a fetal blood vessel called the ductus arteriosus from closing after birth as it should. This condition is called patent ductus arteriosus, or PDA.\\n                \\nThe ductus arteriosus connects a lung artery to a heart artery. If it remains open, it can strain the heart and increase blood pressure in the lung arteries.\\n                \\nOther Complications\\n                \\nComplications of RDS also may include blindness and other eye problems and a bowel disease called necrotizing enterocolitis (EN-ter-o-ko-LI-tis). Infants who have severe RDS can develop kidney failure.\\n                \\nSome infants who have RDS develop bleeding in the brain. This bleeding can delay mental development. It also can cause mental retardation or cerebral palsy.\", \"Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is common in premature infants. Thus, doctors usually recognize and begin treating the disorder as soon as babies are born.\\n                \\nDoctors also do several tests to rule out other conditions that could be causing an infant's breathing problems. The tests also can confirm that the doctors have diagnosed the condition correctly.\\n                \\nThe tests include:\\n                \\nChest x ray. A chest x ray creates a of the structures inside the chest, such as the heart and lungs. This test can show whether your infant has signs of RDS. A chest x ray also can detect problems, such as a collapsed lung, that may require urgent treatment.\\n                \\nBlood tests. Blood tests are used to see whether an infant has enough oxygen in his or her blood. Blood tests also can help find out whether an infection is causing the infant's breathing problems.\\n                \\nEchocardiography (echo). This test uses sound waves to create a moving picture of the heart. Echo is used to rule out heart defects as the cause of an infant's breathing problems.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283465.950316}
