It is estimated that greater than 90% of cases of EEC syndrome are caused by mutations in the TP63 gene. The remainder are suspected to be caused by different mutations in a region on chromosome 7. Genetic testing is available to detect both mutations in the TP63 gene and in the implicated region on chromosome 7.  Genetic Testing Registry lists the names of laboratories that are performing genetic testing for EEC syndrome. To view the contact information for the clinical laboratories conducting testing click here. Testing for individuals with a family history of EEC syndrome who may have a mutation but do not exhibit signs and symptoms of the condition may be available if the mutation in the affected family member(s) is known. Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at risk may also be available if the mutation in the family is known. Please note that most of the laboratories listed through GeneTests do not accept direct contact from patients and their families; therefore, if you are interested in learning more, you will need to work with a health care provider or a genetics professional.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Spastic paraplegia facial cutaneous lesions? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Spastic paraplegia facial cutaneous lesions. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) EEG abnormality 90% Gait disturbance 90% Hemiplegia/hemiparesis 90% Hyperreflexia 90% Hypertonia 90% Hypopigmented skin patches 90% Irregular hyperpigmentation 90% Neurological speech impairment 90% Urticaria 90% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Hand and foot deformity with flat facies?
