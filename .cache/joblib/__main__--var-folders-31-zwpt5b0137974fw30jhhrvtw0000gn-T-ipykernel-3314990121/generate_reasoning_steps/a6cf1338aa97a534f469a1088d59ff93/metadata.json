The ICE syndromes predominantly affect Caucasian, young to middle-aged women, and involve one eye. While there have been some cases of Cogan-Reese syndrome reported in children, the disease is typically observed in females in the mid-adult years. [1] In one study of 71 patients with ICE syndrome, the mean age at diagnosis was 51-years. Known glaucoma was present in 11 (15%) of cases. [2] While it is not yet known how to keep Cogan-Reese syndrome from progressing, the glaucoma associated with the disease can be treated with medication. Additionally, corneal transplant can treat any corneal swelling. The National Eye Institute provides information on screening for glaucoma HERE.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Acrocapitofemoral dysplasia? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Acrocapitofemoral dysplasia. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the femur 90% Abnormality of the hip bone 90% Brachydactyly syndrome 90% Cone-shaped epiphysis 90% Delayed skeletal maturation 90% Micromelia 90% Short stature 90% Abnormal form of the vertebral bodies 50% Abnormality of the metacarpal bones 50% Anonychia 50% Genu varum 50% Hyperlordosis 50% Macrocephaly 7.5% Narrow chest 7.5% Pectus carinatum 7.5% Pectus excavatum 7.5% Scoliosis 7.5% Short thorax 7.5% Autosomal recessive inheritance - Broad nail - Cone-shaped capital femoral epiphysis - Cone-shaped epiphysis of the 1st metacarpal - Coxa vara - Cupped ribs - Delayed ossification of carpal bones - Disproportionate short stature - Disproportionate short-limb short stature - Dysplasia of the femoral head - Enlargement of the distal femoral epiphysis - Fibular overgrowth - Flared iliac wings - Hypoplasia of the radius - Hypoplasia of the ulna - Hypoplastic iliac wing - Lumbar hyperlordosis - Ovoid vertebral bodies - Relative macrocephaly - Short distal phalanx of finger - Short femoral neck - Short femur - Short humerus - Short metacarpal - Short palm - Short proximal phalanx of finger - Short proximal phalanx of thumb - Short ribs - Short tibia - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', \"Protein C deficiency is a disorder that increases a person's risk to develop abnormal blood clots. The condition can be mild or severe. People with mild protein C deficiency are at risk for a type of clot called deep vein thrombosis (DVT). A DVT can travel through the bloodstream and become stuck in the lung, which can cause a life-threatening pulmonary embolism. Most people with mild protein C deficiency never develop abnormal blood clots, but certain factors can increase the risk to develop a blood clot. In severe protein C deficiency, affected infants develop a life-threatening blood clotting disorder called purpura fulminans soon after birth. This is characterized by blood clots that block normal blood flow and can lead to death of body tissues (necrosis). Abnormal bleeding can occur in various parts of the body causing purple patches on the skin. Protein C deficiency may be inherited or acquired. The inherited form is caused by mutations in the PROC gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most people with protein C deficiency do not have any symptoms and require no specific treatment. However, in situations of clot risk such as pregnancy, surgery or trauma, prevention treatment may be indicated. Patients with the severe form of the disease are treated depending on the symptoms. A protein C concentrate is effective in many cases. Liver transplant may cure the babies with this disease.\", 'What are the signs and symptoms of Protein C deficiency?
