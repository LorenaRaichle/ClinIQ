Chronic means that it lasts a long time, often a lifetime. Psoriasis affects more than 5 million adults in the United States. It appears about equally in males and females. Psoriasis occurs when the skin cells grow too quickly. The body does not shed these excess cells and they build up on the surface of the skin, forming thick, scaly patches.   Types of Psoriasis Psoriasis occurs in five different forms that affect both men and women. Most people have only one type of psoriasis at a time. Sometimes, one type of psoriasis will disappear and another will appear. Here is a brief overview of the different forms of psoriasis. - Is the most common form  - appears as raised red patches covered in silvery white scales   - usually shows up on the scalp, knees, elbows and lower back   - patches may itch or be painful and can also crack and bleed.

These cells normally travel through the bloodstream to help fight an infection, but in people with psoriasis, they attack the bodys skin cells by mistake. Genes Play a Role No one knows what causes T cells to go wrong, but certain genes have been linked to psoriasis. People who have these genes are more likely to develop psoriasis than people without the genes. However, genes alone do not cause psoriasis. Scientists believe psoriasis occurs when something in the environment triggers the disease in someone who has one or more of these genes.  Psoriasis Triggers These so-called triggers may be different for different people. Different triggers may start the disease or make it worse in different people. Factors that may trigger psoriasis or make it worse include - physical and emotional stress  - injury to the skin such as cuts or burns  - infections, particularly strep throat  - cold weather   - smoking or heavy alcohol use  - certain medications such as     - lithium, a psychiatric drug   - antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine    - inderal, a high blood pressure medicine   - quinidine, a heart medication   - indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug often used to treat arthritis.   physical and emotional stress injury to the skin such as cuts or burns infections, particularly strep throat cold weather smoking or heavy alcohol use certain medications such as - lithium, a psychiatric drug  - antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine   - inderal, a high blood pressure medicine  - quinidine, a heart medication  - indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug often used to treat arthritis. lithium, a psychiatric drug antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine inderal, a high blood pressure medicine quinidine, a heart medication indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug often used to treat arthritis.', \"Different forms of psoriasis have different symptoms. In many cases your doctor can diagnose psoriasis based on the signs seen in the physical exam as well as the symptoms you describe. Symptoms The most common symptoms of psoriasis are - patches of thick, red skin   - skin inflammation  - silvery scales  - itching  - pain. patches of thick, red skin skin inflammation silvery scales itching pain. Psoriasis most commonly affects the elbows, knees, scalp, lower back, face, palms, soles of the feet, nails, and soft tissues. Making a Diagnosis In most cases, your primary care provider can diagnose psoriasis simply by examining your skin. Because the symptoms of psoriasis may be similar to those of other skin diseases, however, sometimes the diagnosis is more difficult. You may need to see a dermatologist, a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating skin diseases. If your doctor isn't sure if you have psoriasis, he or she may order a biopsy. This involves removing a small sample of skin and looking at it under a microscope.\", 'The goals of psoriasis treatment are to change the course of the disease by interfering with the increased production of skin cells, and to remove scales and smooth rough skin. There are many types of treatments. Many are medicines and other treatments your doctor will have to prescribe. But there are other types of treatments you can buy without a prescription or try on your own. Some treatments for psoriasis are applied directly to the skin. Some use light to treat skin lesions. Others are taken by mouth or injected. This chapter focuses on treatments that are applied directly to the skin -- also called topical treatments or light therapy.  Topical Treatments Here are some different types of topical treatments for psoriasis. - helps soften and loosen skin scales  - comes as a cream, lotion, liquid, gel, ointment or shampoo. helps soften and loosen skin scales comes as a cream, lotion, liquid, gel, ointment or shampoo. - reduce inflammation and slow the growth and build-up of skin cells   - are used in different strengths for different parts of the body.  reduce inflammation and slow the growth and build-up of skin cells are used in different strengths for different parts of the body. - works by slowing the production of skin cells   - is often combined with a steroid for added effects   - may be used with UVB light.  works by slowing the production of skin cells is often combined with a steroid for added effects may be used with UVB light. - is used to treat long-term psoriasis and hard-to-treat plaques  - reduces inflammation   - slows down the growth of skin cells. is used to treat long-term psoriasis and hard-to-treat plaques reduces inflammation slows down the growth of skin cells. - cause the skin to shed dead cells  - slow the growth of skin cells   - decrease itching.  cause the skin to shed dead cells slow the growth of skin cells decrease itching. - are believed to work by reducing skin cell overgrowth  - decrease inflammation  - are often used with other treatments.  are believed to work by reducing skin cell overgrowth decrease inflammation are often used with other treatments. - slow down the growth of skin cells   - may be used with steroid creams for added effects.  slow down the growth of skin cells may be used with steroid creams for added effects. Regardless of the topical medication your doctor prescribes, it is important to follow directions carefully. Some can be messy and stain your clothing and bedding. Others can have potentially dangerous side effects. Light Therapy Light therapy, also called phototherapy, uses ultraviolet light to treat skin lesions. Laser therapy delivers intense, focused doses of light to specific areas of the skin to clear lesions without harming surrounding tissues. Here are some different kinds of light therapy. UVB phototherapy - penetrates the skin to slow the growth of affected cells   - is given at home or at the doctors office   - may be combined with topical treatments or injected or oral medicines to increase effectiveness. penetrates the skin to slow the growth of affected cells is given at home or at the doctors office may be combined with topical treatments or injected or oral medicines to increase effectiveness.
