It is a fungus that lives almost everywhere, including in your body. Usually, your immune system keeps yeast under control. If you are sick or taking antibiotics, it can multiply and cause an infection.     Yeast infections affect different parts of the body in different ways:        - Thrush is a yeast infection that causes white patches in your mouth     - Candida esophagitis is thrush that spreads to your esophagus, the tube that takes food from your mouth to your stomach. It can make it hard or painful to swallow.     - Women can get vaginal yeast infections, causing itchiness, pain and discharge    - Yeast infections of the skin cause itching and rashes     - Yeast infections in your bloodstream can be life-threatening        Antifungal medicines get rid of yeast infections in most people. If you have a weak immune system, treatment might be more difficult.', 'Summary : What kind of medical care would you want if you were too ill or hurt to express your wishes? Advance directives are legal documents that allow you to spell out your decisions about end-of-life care ahead of time. They give you a way to tell your wishes to family, friends, and health care professionals and to avoid confusion later on.     A living will tells which treatments you want if you are dying or permanently unconscious. You can accept or refuse medical care. You might want to include instructions on       - The use of dialysis and breathing machines    -  If you want to be resuscitated if your breathing or heartbeat stops     -  Tube feeding    -  Organ or tissue donation         A durable power of attorney for health care is a document that names your health care proxy. Your proxy is someone you trust to make health decisions for you if you are unable to do so.     NIH: National Cancer Institute', 'The rectum is the lower part of your large intestine where your body stores stool. Problems with rectum are common. They include hemorrhoids, abscesses, incontinence and cancer.     Many people are embarrassed to talk about rectal troubles. But seeing your doctor about problems in this area is important. This is especially true if you have pain or bleeding. Treatments vary widely depending on the particular problem.     NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Summary : Radiation is energy that travels in the form of waves or high-speed particles. It occurs naturally in sunlight. Man-made radiation is used in X-rays, nuclear weapons, nuclear power plants and cancer treatment.     If you are exposed to small amounts of radiation over a long time, it raises your risk of cancer. It can also cause mutations in your genes, which you could pass on to any children you have after the exposure. A lot of radiation over a short period, such as from a radiation emergency, can cause burns or radiation sickness. Symptoms of radiation sickness include nausea, weakness, hair loss, skin burns and reduced organ function. If the exposure is large enough, it can cause premature aging or even death. You may be able to take medicine to reduce the radioactive material in your body.     Environmental Protection Agency']}"}, "time": 1746283466.6945431}
