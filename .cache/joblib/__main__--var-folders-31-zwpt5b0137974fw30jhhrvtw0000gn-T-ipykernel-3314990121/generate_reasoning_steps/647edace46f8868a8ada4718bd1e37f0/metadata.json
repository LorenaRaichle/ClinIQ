White blood cells help your body fight infection. Your blood cells form in your bone marrow. In leukemia, however, the bone marrow produces abnormal white blood cells. These cells crowd out the healthy blood cells, making it hard for blood to do its work. In acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), also called acute lymphoblastic leukemia, there are too many of specific types of white blood cells called lymphocytes or lymphoblasts. ALL is the most common type of cancer in children.    Possible risk factors for ALL include being male, being white, previous chemotherapy treatment, exposure to radiation, and for adults, being older than 70.    Symptoms of ALL include:       - Weakness or feeling tired    - Fever    - Easy bruising or bleeding    - Bleeding under the skin    - Shortness of breath    - Weight loss or loss of appetite    - Pain in the bones or stomach    - Pain or a feeling of fullness below the ribs    - Painless lumps in the neck, underarm, stomach, or groin       Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow diagnose ALL. Treatments include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, stem cell transplants, and targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells. Once the leukemia is in remission, you need additional treatment to make sure that it does not come back.    NIH: National Cancer Institute', 'Your salivary glands make saliva - sometimes called spit - and empty it into your mouth through openings called ducts. Saliva makes your food moist, which helps you chew and swallow. It helps you digest your food. It also cleans your mouth and contains antibodies that can kill germs.    Salivary gland cancer is a type of head and neck cancer. It is rare. It may not cause any symptoms, or you could notice       - A lump in your ear, cheek, jaw, lip, or inside the mouth    - Fluid draining from your ear    - Trouble swallowing or opening the mouth widely    - Numbness, weakness, or pain in your face       Doctors diagnose salivary gland cancer using a physical exam, imaging tests, and a biopsy. Treatment can include surgery, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy.    NIH: National Cancer Institute', 'Summary : Military service members and veterans face some different health issues than civilians. During combat, the main health concerns are life-threatening injuries. These include       - Shrapnel and gunshot wounds    - Lost limbs    - Head and brain injuries       There may also be a risk of health problems from exposure to environmental hazards, such as contaminated water, chemicals, and infections.     Being in combat and being separated from your family can be stressful. The stress can put service members and veterans at risk for mental health problems. These include anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and substance abuse. Suicide can also be a concern.', 'Rosacea is a long-term disease that affects your skin and sometimes your eyes. It causes redness and pimples. Rosacea is most common in women and people with fair skin. It most often affects middle-aged and older adults.    In most cases, rosacea only affects the face. Symptoms can include       - Frequent redness of the face, or flushing     - Small, red lines under the skin    - Acne    - A swollen nose    - Thick skin, usually on the forehead, chin, and cheeks     - Red, dry, itchy eyes and sometimes vision problems        No one knows what causes rosacea. You may be more likely to have it if you blush a lot or if rosacea runs in your family. Rosacea is not dangerous. There is no cure, but treatments can help. They include medicines and sometimes surgery.    NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases']}"}, "time": 1746283467.571845}
