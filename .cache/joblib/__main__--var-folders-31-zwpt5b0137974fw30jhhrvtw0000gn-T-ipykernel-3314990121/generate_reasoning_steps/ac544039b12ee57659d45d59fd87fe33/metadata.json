However, lifestyle changes and medicines often can treat symptoms successfully and delay problems for many years. Eventually, though, you may need surgery to repair or replace a faulty heart valve.\\n                \\nThe goals of treating heart valve disease might include:\\n                \\nMedicines\\n                \\nRepairing or replacing faulty valves\\n                \\nLifestyle changes to treat other related heart conditions\\n                \\nMedicines\\n                \\nIn addition to heart-healthy lifestyle changes, your doctor may prescribe medicines to:\\n                \\nLower high blood pressure or high blood cholesterol.\\n                \\nPrevent arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats).\\n                \\nThin the blood and prevent clots (if you have a man-made replacement valve). Doctors also prescribe these medicines for mitral stenosis or other valve defects that raise the risk of blood clots.\\n                \\nTreat coronary heart disease. Medicines for coronary heart disease can reduce your hearts workload and relieve symptoms.\\n                \\nTreatheart failure. Heart failure medicines widen blood vessels and rid the body of excess fluid.\\n                \\nRepairing or Replacing Heart Valves\\n                \\nYour doctor may recommend repairing or replacing your heart valve(s), even if your heart valve disease isnt causing symptoms. Repairing or replacing a valve can prevent lasting damage to your heart and sudden death.\\n                \\nThe decision to repair or replace heart valves depends on many factors, including:\\n                \\nThe severity of your valve disease\\n                \\nWhether you need heart surgery for other conditions, such as bypass surgery to treat coronary heart disease. Bypass surgery and valve surgery can be performed at the sametime.\\n                \\nYour age and general health\\n                \\nWhen possible, heart valve repair is preferred over heart valve replacement. Valve repair preserves the strength and function of the heart muscle. People who have valve repair also have a lower risk of infective endocarditis after the surgery, and they dont need to take blood-thinning medicines for the rest of their lives.\\n                \\nHowever, heart valve repair surgery is harder to do than valve replacement. Also, not all valves can be repaired. Mitral valves often can be repaired. Aortic and pulmonary valves often have to be replaced.\\n                \\nRepairing Heart Valves\\n                \\nHeart surgeons can repair heart valves by:\\n                \\nAdding tissue to patch holes or tears or to increase the support at the base of the valve\\n                \\nRemoving or reshaping tissue so the valve can close tighter\\n                \\nSeparating fused valve flaps\\n                \\nSometimes cardiologists repair heart valves using cardiac catheterization. Although catheter procedures are less invasive than surgery, they may not work as well for some patients. Work with your doctor to decide whether repair is appropriate. If so, your doctor can advise you on the best procedure.\\n                \\nHeart valves that cannot open fully (stenosis) can be repaired with surgery or with a less invasive catheter procedure called balloon valvuloplasty. This procedure also is called balloonvalvotomy.\\n                \\nDuring the procedure, a catheter (thin tube) with a balloon at its tip is threaded through a blood vessel to the faulty valve in your heart. The balloon is inflated to help widen the opening of the valve. Your doctor then deflates the balloon and removes both it and the tube. Youre awake during the procedure, which usually requires an overnight stay in a hospital.\\n                \\nBalloon valvuloplasty relieves many symptoms of heart valve disease, but may not cure it. The condition can worsen over time. You still may need medicines to treat symptoms or surgery to repair or replace the faulty valve. Balloon valvuloplasty has a shorter recovery time than surgery. The procedure may work as well as surgery for some patients who have mitral valve stenosis. For these people, balloon valvuloplasty often is preferred over surgical repair or replacement.\\n                \\nBalloon valvuloplasty doesnt work as well as surgery for adults who have aortic valve stenosis. Doctors often use balloon valvuloplasty to repair valve stenosis in infants and children.\\n                \\nReplacing Heart Valves\\n                \\nSometimes heart valves cant be repaired and must be replaced. This surgery involves removing the faulty valve and replacing it with a man-made or biological valve.\\n                \\nBiological valves are made from pig, cow, or human heart tissue and may have man-made parts as well. These valves are specially treated, so you wont need medicines to stop your body from rejecting the valve.\\n                \\nMan-made valves last longer than biological valves and usually dont have to be replaced. Biological valves usually have to be replaced after about 10 years, although newer ones may last 15years or longer. Unlike biological valves, however, man-made valves require you to take blood-thinning medicines for the rest of your life. These medicines prevent blood clots from forming on the valve. Blood clots can cause a heart attack or stroke. Man-made valves also raise your risk of infective endocarditis.\\n                \\nYou and your doctor will decide together whether you should have a man-made or biological replacement valve.\\n                \\nIf youre a woman of childbearing age or if youre athletic, you may prefer a biological valve so you dont have to take blood-thinning medicines. If youre elderly, you also may prefer a biological valve, as it will likely last for the rest of your life.\\n                \\nRoss Procedure\\n                \\nDoctors also can treat faulty aortic valves with the Ross procedure. During this surgery, your doctor removes your faulty aortic valve and replaces it with your pulmonary valve. Your pulmonary valve is then replaced with a pulmonary valve from a deceased humandonor.\\n                \\nThis is more involved surgery than typical valve replacement, and it has a greater risk of complications. The Ross procedure may be especially useful for children because the surgically replaced valves continue to grow with the child. Also, lifelong treatment with blood-thinning medicines isnt required. But in some patients, one or both valves fail to work well within a few years of the surgery. Researchers continue to study the use of this procedure.\\n                \\nOther Approaches for Repairing and Replacing Heart Valves\\n                \\nSome forms of heart valve repair and replacement surgery are less invasive than traditional surgery. These procedures use smaller incisions (cuts) to reach the heart valves. Hospital stays for these newer types of surgery usually are 3 to 5 days, compared with a 5-day stay for traditional heart valve surgery.\\n                \\nNew surgeries tend to cause less pain and have a lower risk of infection. Recovery time also tends to be shorter2to 4weeks versus 6to 8weeks for traditional surgery.\\n                \\nTranscatheter Valve Therapy\\n                \\nInterventional cardiologists perform procedures that involve threading clips or other devices to repair faulty heart valves using a catheter (tube) inserted through a large blood vessel. The clips or devices are used to reshape the valves and stop the backflow of blood. People who receive these clips recover more easily than people who have surgery. However, the clips may not treat backflow as well as surgery.\\n                \\nDoctors also may use a catheter to replace faulty aortic valves. This procedure is called transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). For this procedure, the catheter usually is inserted into an artery in the groin (upper thigh) and threaded to the heart. A deflated balloon with a folded replacement valve around it is at the end of the catheter.\\n                \\nOnce the replacement valve is placed properly, the balloon is used to expand the new valve so it fits securely within the old valve. The balloon is then deflated, and the balloon and catheter are removed.\\n                \\nA replacement valve also can be inserted in an existing replacement valve that is failing. This is called a valve-in-valve procedure.\\n                \\nLifestyle Changes to Treat Other Related Heart\\n                \\nTo help treat heart conditions related to heart valve disease, your doctor may advise you to make heart-healthy lifestyle changes, such as:\\n                \\nHeart-healthy eating\\n                \\nMaintaining a healthy weight\\n                \\nManaging stress\\n                \\nPhysical activity\\n                \\nQuitting smoking\\n                \\nHeart-Healthy Eating\\n                \\nYour doctor may recommend heart-healthy eating, which should include:\\n                \\nFat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk\\n                \\nFish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week\\n                \\nFruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes\\n                \\nLegumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans\\n                \\nVegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots\\n                \\nWhole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas\\n                \\nWhen following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating:\\n                \\nA lot of red meat\\n                \\nPalm and coconut oils\\n                \\nSugary foods and beverages\\n                \\nTwo nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise:\\n                \\nSaturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals\\n                \\nTrans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats and meats.\\n                \\nSaturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5percent to 6percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples:\\n                \\nAvocadosNot all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterol levels. Some sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are:\\n                \\nCorn, sunflower, and soybean oils\\n                \\nNuts and seeds, such as walnuts\\n                \\nOlive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils\\n                \\nPeanut butter\\n                \\nSalmon and trout\\n                \\nTofu\\n                \\nSodium\\n                \\nYou should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.\\n                \\nDietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension\\n                \\nYour doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt.\\n                \\nThe DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH.\\n                \\nAlcohol\\n                \\nTry to limit alcohol intake. Too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weightgain.\\n                \\nMen should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is:\\n                \\n12 ounces of beer\\n                \\n5 ounces of wine\\n                \\n1 ounces of liquor\\n                \\nMaintaining a Healthy Weight\\n                \\nMaintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for heart valve disease. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active.\\n                \\nKnowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI:\\n                \\nBelow 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.\\n                \\nBetween 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range.\\n                \\nBetween 25.0 and 29.9 is considered overweight.\\n                \\nOf 30.0 or higher is considered obese.\\n                \\nA general goal to aim for is a BMI of less than 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal.\\n                \\nMeasuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type2 diabetes. This risk may be higher with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk.\\n                \\nIf youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol.\\n                \\nManaging Stress\\n                \\nLearning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as:\\n                \\nA stress management program\\n                \\nMeditation\\n                \\nPhysical activity\\n                \\nRelaxation therapy\\n                \\nTalking things out with friends or family\\n                \\nPhysical Activity\\n                \\nRegular physical activity can lower many heart valve disease risk factors.\\n                \\nEveryone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1hour and 15minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10minutes at a time spread throughout the week.\\n                \\nTalk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.\\n                \\nRead more about physical activity at:\\n                \\nPhysical Activity and Your Heart\\n                \\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans\\n                \\nQuitting Smoking\\n                \\nIf you smoke or use tobacco, quit. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels and raise your risk for atherosclerosis and other health problems. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.\\n                \\nFor more information about how to quit smoking, visit the Smoking and Your Heart Health Topic.', 'To prevent heart valve disease caused by rheumatic fever, see your doctor if you have signs of a strep infection. These signs include a painful sore throat, fever, and white spots on your tonsils. If you do have a strep infection, be sure to take all medicines prescribed to treat it. Prompt treatment of strep infections can prevent rheumatic fever, which damages the heartvalves.\\n                \\nIts possible that exercise, a heart-healthy diet, and medicines that lower cholesterol might prevent aortic stenosis (thickening and stiffening of the aortic valve). Researchers continue to study this possibility.\\n                \\nHeart-healthy eating, physical activity, other heart-healthy lifestyle changes, and medicines aimed at preventing a heart attack, high blood pressure, or heart failure also may help prevent heart valve disease.', \"Obesity hypoventilation (HI-po-ven-tih-LA-shun) syndrome (OHS) is a breathing disorder that affects some obese people. In OHS, poor breathing results in too much carbon dioxide (hypoventilation) and too little oxygen in the blood (hypoxemia).\\n                \\nOHS sometimes is called Pickwickian syndrome.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nTo understand OHS, it helps to understand how the lungs work. When you breathe, air passes through your nose and mouth into your windpipe. The air then travels to your lungs' air sacs. These sacs are called alveoli (al-VEE-uhl-eye).\\n                \\nSmall blood vessels called capillaries (KAP-ih-lare-ees) run through the walls of the air sacs. When air reaches the air sacs, oxygen passes through the air sac walls into the blood in the capillaries. At the same time, carbon dioxide moves from the capillaries into the air sacs. This process is called gas exchange.\\n                \\nIn people who have OHS, poor breathing prevents proper gas exchange. As a result, the level of carbon dioxide in the blood rises. Also, the level of oxygen in the blood drops.\\n                \\nThese changes can lead to serious health problems, such as leg edema (e-DE-mah), pulmonary hypertension (PULL-mun-ary HI-per-TEN-shun), cor pulmonale (pul-meh-NAL-e), and secondary erythrocytosis (eh-RITH-ro-si-TOE-sis). If left untreated, OHS can even be fatal.\\n                \\nThe cause of OHS isn't fully known. Researchers think that several factors may work together to cause the disorder.\\n                \\nMany people who have OHS also have obstructive sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea is a common disorder in which the airway collapses or is blocked during sleep. This causes pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep.\\n                \\nObstructive sleep apnea disrupts your sleep and causes you to feel very tired during the day. (For more information, go to the Health Topics Sleep Apnea article.)\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nDoctors treat OHS in a number of ways. One way is with positive airway pressure (PAP) machines, which are used during sleep.\\n                \\nPAP therapy uses mild air pressure to keep your airways open. Your doctor might recommend CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) or BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure).\\n                \\nIf your doctor prescribes PAP therapy, you'll work with someone from a home equipment provider to select a CPAP or BiPAP machine. The home equipment provider will help you select a machine based on your prescription and the features that meet your needs.\\n                \\nOther treatments for OHS include ventilator (VEN-til-a-tor) support and medicines. (A ventilator is a machine that supports breathing.)\\n                \\nOHS occurs with obesity, so your doctor will likely recommend weight loss as part of your treatment plan. Successful weight loss often involves setting goals and making lifestyle changes, such as following a healthy diet and being physically active.\\n                \\nOHS can lead to other serious health problems, so following your treatment plan is important. Your health care team, home equipment provider, and family can help you manage your treatment.\", \"Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is a breathing disorder that affects some obese people.
