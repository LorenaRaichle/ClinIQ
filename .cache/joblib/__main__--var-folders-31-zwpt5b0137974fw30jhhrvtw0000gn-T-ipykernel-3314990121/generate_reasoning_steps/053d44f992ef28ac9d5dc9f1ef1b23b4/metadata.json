The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Weissenbacher-Zweymuller syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of pelvic girdle bone morphology - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Cleft palate - Coronal cleft vertebrae - Depressed nasal bridge - Dumbbell-shaped long bone - Enlarged epiphyses - Hypertelorism - Pierre-Robin sequence - Proptosis - Rhizomelia - Sensorineural hearing impairment - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Multiple pterygium syndrome, Escobar type is characterized by webbing of the neck, elbows, and/or knees, and joint contractures. Symptoms of Escobar syndrome are present from birth. It can be caused by mutations in the CHRNG gene. It tends to be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Multiple pterygium syndrome Escobar type? Symptoms of multiple pterygium syndrome, Escobar type vary but may include short stature, vertebral (spine) defects, joint contractures, and webbing of the neck, armpit, elbow, knee, between the legs, and of the fingers and toes. The joint contractures may interfere with walking, making walking more difficult. Other symptoms may include down-slanting eyes, skin fold over the inner corner of the eye, a pointed, receding chin, droopy eye lids, and cleft palate. Males with Escobar syndrome may have undescended testicles at birth, and females may have absent labia majora. People with Escobar syndrome may have in-curving of the little finger, joined fingers, and rocker-bottom feet. They may also have kyphoscoliosis and other spine defects, such as fusion of the spine. Abnormal ossicles (the three small bones in the ear) may lead to conductive hearing loss. Other skeletal anomalies include rib fusions, radial head and hip dislocations, talipes calcaneovalgus (the foot points inwards and down) or club foot, and missing or underdeveloped kneecap.

Some cases of multiple pterygium syndrome, Escobar type are caused by mutations in the CHRNG gene. There are likely other causes of this syndrome as well which have not yet been identified. As a result, in some cases the cause for the syndrome can not be determined.  Escobar syndrome is usually inherited in an autosomal-recessive fashion.']}"}, "time": 1746283457.69842}
