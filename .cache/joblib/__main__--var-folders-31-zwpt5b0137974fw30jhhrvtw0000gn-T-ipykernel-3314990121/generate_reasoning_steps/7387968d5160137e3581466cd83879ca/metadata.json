Acquired long QT syndrome can be caused by certain medicines and medical conditions. Some medications that cause long QT syndrome include antihistamines and decongestants, antibiotics, antidepressants, and cholesterol-lowering medicines. Examples of medical conditions that can cause long QT syndrome include excessive diarrhea or vomiting and certain thyroid disorders. Inherited forms of long QT syndrome are caused by changes in genes that control the heart muscles electrical activity. Inherited long QT syndrome may be isolated (occur alone without other associated symptoms) or be due to a genetic syndrome, such as Romano-Ward syndrome, Jervell Lang-Nielsen syndrome, Anderson-Tawil syndrome, and Timothy syndrome.', 'How is long QT syndrome diagnosed? Long QT syndrome is diagnosed on the basis of electrocardiographic (EKG) findings, clinical findings such as congenital deafness or unexplained fainting, and family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death. Genetic testing is often performed in families in whom the diagnosis of long QT syndrome has been made or is suspected on clinical grounds.', 'Pyle disease is a bone disorder characterized by genu valgum (knock knees), Erlenmeyer flask deformity (where there is relative constriction of the diaphysis or shaft of the bone and flaring of the metaphysis or end of the bone), widening of the ribs and clavicles (collarbones), platyspondyly (flattening of the bones of the spine) and cortical thinning. Only about 30 cases have been reported in the literature. Cranial involvement is minimal with some showing mild hyperostosis (excessive new bone formation ) of the skull base and thickening of the frontal and occipital bones. Pyle disease is passed through families in an autosomal recessive manner.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Pyle disease? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Pyle disease. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Genu valgum 90% Abnormality of pelvic girdle bone morphology 50% Abnormality of the clavicle 50% Abnormality of the elbow 50% Abnormality of the ribs 50% Craniofacial hyperostosis 50% Mandibular prognathia 50% Prominent supraorbital ridges 50% Recurrent fractures 50% Scoliosis 50% Abnormal form of the vertebral bodies 7.5% Carious teeth 7.5% Dental malocclusion 7.5% Abnormality of the thorax - Arthralgia - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Limited elbow extension - Metaphyseal dysplasia - Muscle weakness - Platyspondyly - Thickened calvaria - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.']}"}, "time": 1746283460.224229}
