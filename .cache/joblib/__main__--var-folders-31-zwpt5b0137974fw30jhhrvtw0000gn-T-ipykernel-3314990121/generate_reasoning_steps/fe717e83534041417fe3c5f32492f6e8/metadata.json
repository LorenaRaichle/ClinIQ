There are several different forms of leishmaniasis. The most common are cutaneous and visceral. The cutaneous type causes skin sores. The visceral type affects internal organs such as the spleen, liver, and bone marrow. People with this form usually have fever, weight loss, and an enlarged spleen and liver.     Leishmaniasis is found in parts of about 88 countries. Most of these countries are in the tropics and subtropics. It is possible but very unlikely that you would get this disease in the United States. But you should be aware of it if you are traveling to the Middle East or parts of Central America, South America, Asia, Africa or southern Europe.     Treatment is with medicines that contain antimony, a type of metal, or with strong antibiotics. The best way to prevent the disease is to protect yourself from sand fly bites:       - Stay indoors from dusk to dawn, when sand flies are the most active    - Wear long pants and long-sleeved shirts when outside    - Use insect repellent and bed nets as needed       Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Your cornea is the outermost layer of your eye. It is clear and shaped like a dome. The cornea helps to shield the rest of the eye from germs, dust, and other harmful matter. It also helps your eye to focus. If you wear contact lenses, they float on top of your corneas.     Problems with the cornea include       - Refractive errors    - Allergies    - Infections    - Injuries    - Dystrophies - conditions in which parts of the cornea lose clarity due to a buildup of cloudy material       Treatments of corneal disorders include medicines, corneal transplantation, and corneal laser surgery.     NIH: National Eye Institute', \"The colon and rectum are part of the large intestine. Colorectal cancer occurs when tumors form in the lining of the large intestine. It is common in both men and women. The risk of developing colorectal cancer rises after age 50. You're also more likely to get it if you have colorectal polyps, a family history of colorectal cancer, ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, eat a diet high in fat, or smoke.    Symptoms of colorectal cancer include       - Diarrhea or constipation    - A feeling that your bowel does not empty completely    - Blood (either bright red or very dark) in your stool    - Stools that are narrower than usual    - Frequent gas pains or cramps, or feeling full or bloated    - Weight loss with no known reason    - Fatigue    - Nausea or vomiting       Because you may not have symptoms at first, it's important to have screening tests. Everyone over 50 should get screened. Tests include colonoscopy and tests for blood in the stool. Treatments for colorectal cancer include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or a combination. Surgery can usually cure it when it is found early.    NIH: National Cancer Institute\", 'Summary : For many people, laser eye surgery can correct their vision so they no longer need glasses or contact lenses. Laser eye surgery reshapes the cornea, the clear front part of the eye. This changes its focusing power.    There are different types of laser eye surgery. LASIK - laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis - is one of the most common. Many patients who have LASIK end up with 20/20 vision. But, like all medical procedures, it has both risks and benefits. Only your eye doctor can tell if you are a good candidate for laser eye surgery.']}"}, "time": 1746283467.5912771}
