Normal blood pressure is less than 120/80. Ask your doctor what your blood pressure goal should be. If you have high blood pressure, you will need to treat it and control it for life. This means making lifestyle changes, and, in some cases, taking prescribed medicines, and getting ongoing medical care.', 'Today, many different types of medicines are available to control high blood pressure. These medicines work in different ways. Some lower blood pressure by removing extra fluid and salt from your body. Others affect blood pressure by slowing down the heartbeat, or by relaxing and widening blood vessels. Often, two or more drugs work better than one. Here are the types of medicines used to treat high blood pressure. -   Diuretics (water or fluid Pills)  flush excess sodium from your body, which reduces the amount of fluid in your blood and helps to lower your blood pressure. Diuretics are often used with other high blood pressure medicines, sometimes in one combined pill.   -  Beta Blockers help your heart beat slower and with less force. As a result, your heart pumps less blood through your blood vessels, which can help to lower your blood pressure.  -  Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors. Angiotensin-II is a hormone that narrows blood vessels, increasing blood pressure. ACE converts Angiotensin I to Angiotensin II. ACE inhibitors block this process, which stops the production of Angiotensin II, lowering blood pressure.  -  Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs) block angiotensin II hormone from binding with receptors in the blood vessels. When angiotensin II is blocked, the blood vessels do not constrict or narrow, which can lower your blood pressure.  -  Calcium Channel Blockers keep calcium from entering the muscle cells of your heart and blood vessels. This allows blood vessels to relax, which can lower your blood pressure.   -  Alpha Blockers reduce nerve impulses that tighten blood vessels. This allows blood to flow more freely, causing blood pressure to go down.  -  Alpha-Beta Blockers reduce nerve impulses the same way alpha blockers do. However, like beta blockers, they also slow the heartbeat. As a result, blood pressure goes down.  -  Central Acting Agents act in the brain to decrease nerve signals that narrow blood vessels, which can lower blood pressure.  -  Vasodilators relax the muscles in blood vessel walls, which can lower blood pressure.

These are body mass index, or BMI, and waist circumference. Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of weight in relation to height, and provides an estimate of your total body fat. As your BMI goes up, so do your chances of getting high blood pressure, heart disease, and other health problems. A BMI -  below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.  - between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the healthy range.  - between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight.  - of 30 or more is considered obese.  below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight. between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the healthy range. between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight. of 30 or more is considered obese. See the Body Mass Index Table, available from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). Body mass index (BMI) applies to both men and women, but it does have some limits. - It may overestimate body fat in in someone who is very muscular or who has swelling from fluid retention (called edema)  - It may underestimate body fat in older persons and others who have lost muscle mass. It may overestimate body fat in in someone who is very muscular or who has swelling from fluid retention (called edema) It may underestimate body fat in older persons and others who have lost muscle mass. Thats why waist measurement is often checked as well. Another reason is that too much body fat in the stomach area also increases disease risk. A waist measurement of more than 35 inches in women and more than 40 inches in men is considered high.', 'Blood pressure rises as body weight increases. Losing even 10 pounds can lower blood pressure -- and it has the greatest effect for those who are overweight and already have hypertension. If you are overweight or obese, work with your health care provider to develop a plan to help you lower your weight and maintain a healthy weight. Aim to reduce your weight by 7 to 10 percent over six months, which can lower your risk for health problems. For example, if you are overweight at 200 pounds, try to lose 14 to 20 pounds over six months. After that, you may have to continue to lose weight to get to a healthy weight.']}"}, "time": 1746283468.794843}
