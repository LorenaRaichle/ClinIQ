A doctor, otolaryngologist, audiologist, or physical therapist can treat BPPV by carefully moving the head and torso to move the displaced calcium particles back to their original position Learn more about causes and treatments for BPPV. An NIDCD-supported clinical trial in BPPV showed that repositioning maneuvers work well, and offered clinicians a range of choices in selecting the treatment best suited to each individuals unique needs.', \"Mnire's disease is caused by changes in fluid volumes in the inner ear. People with Mnire's disease can help reduce its dizzying effects by lowering the amount of salt (sodium) in their diets. Limiting alcohol or caffeine also may be helpful. Some medications, such as corticosteroids or the antibiotic gentamicin, also are used to treat Mnire's disease. Although gentamicin can help reduce the dizziness that occurs with Mnire's disease, it occasionally destroys sensory cells in the inner ear, which can result in permanent hearing loss. Corticosteroids don't cause hearing loss; however, research is underway to determine if they are as effective as gentamicin  Learn more about the treatments for Mnire's disease.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283468.044078}
