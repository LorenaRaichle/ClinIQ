Cancer screening is looking for cancer before you have any symptoms. Cancer found early may be easier to treat.    Cervical cancer screening is usually part of a woman's health checkup. There are two types of tests: the Pap test and the HPV test. For both, the doctor or nurse collects cells from the surface of the cervix. With the Pap test, the lab checks the sample for cancer cells or abnormal cells that could become cancer later. With the HPV test, the lab checks for HPV infection. HPV is a virus that spreads through sexual contact. It can sometimes lead to cancer. If your screening tests are abnormal, your doctor may do more tests, such as a biopsy.    Cervical cancer screening has risks. The results can sometimes be wrong, and you may have unnecessary follow-up tests. There are also benefits. Screening has been shown to decrease the number of deaths from cervical cancer. You and your doctor should discuss your risk for cervical cancer, the pros and cons of the screening tests, at what age to start being screened, and how often to be screened.\", \"Mental disorders include a wide range of problems, including       - Anxiety disorders, including panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and phobias    - Bipolar disorder    - Depression    - Mood disorders    - Personality disorders    - Psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia       There are many causes of mental disorders. Your genes and family history may play a role. Your life experiences, such as stress or a history of abuse, may also matter. Biological factors can also be part of the cause. A traumatic brain injury can lead to a mental disorder. A mother's exposure to viruses or toxic chemicals while pregnant may play a part. Other factors may increase your risk, such as use of illegal drugs or having a serious medical condition like cancer.    Medications and counseling can help many mental disorders.\", 'A cataract is a clouding of the lens in your eye. It affects your vision. Cataracts are very common in older people. By age 80, more than half of all Americans either have a cataract or have had cataract surgery.    A cataract can occur in either or both eyes. It cannot spread from one eye to the other. Common symptoms are       - Blurry vision    - Colors that seem faded    - Glare - headlights, lamps or sunlight may seem too bright. You may also see a halo around lights.    - Not being able to see well at night    - Double vision     - Frequent prescription changes in your eye wear        Cataracts usually develop slowly. New glasses, brighter lighting, anti-glare sunglasses or magnifying lenses can help at first. Surgery is also an option. It involves removing the cloudy lens and replacing it with an artificial lens. Wearing sunglasses and a hat with a brim to block ultraviolet sunlight may help to delay cataracts.    NIH: National Eye Institute', 'Summary : Genetic tests are tests on blood and other tissue to find genetic disorders. Over 2000 tests are available. Doctors use genetic tests for several reasons. These include       - Finding genetic diseases in unborn babies    - Finding out if people carry a gene for a disease and might pass it on to their children    - Screening embryos for disease     - Testing for genetic diseases in adults before they cause symptoms    - Making a diagnosis in a person who has disease symptoms    - Figuring out the type or dose of a medicine that is best for a certain person       People have many different reasons for being tested or not being tested. For some, it is important to know whether a disease can be prevented or treated if a test is positive. In some cases, there is no treatment. But test results might help a person make life decisions, such as family planning or insurance coverage. A genetic counselor can provide information about the pros and cons of testing.
