These include people who have -  spinal cord injuries or other nerve damage around the bladder   -  a blockage in the urinary tract that can trap urine in the bladder. A blockage in the urinary tract can be caused by kidney stones, an enlarged prostate, or a birth defect.   -  diabetes   -  problems with the bodys natural defense (or immune) system   -  pelvic organ prolapse, which is when pelvic organs (such as the bladder, rectum, or uterus) shift out of their normal position into the vagina. When pelvic organs are out of place, they can push on the bladder and urethra and make it hard to fully empty the bladder. This causes urine to stay in the bladder. When urine stays in the bladder too long, it makes an infection more likely.  spinal cord injuries or other nerve damage around the bladder a blockage in the urinary tract that can trap urine in the bladder.

Women should wipe from front to back to keep bacteria from getting into the urethra. This step is most important after a bowel movement.  Wipe from front to back after using the toilet. Women should wipe from front to back to keep bacteria from getting into the urethra. This step is most important after a bowel movement.  - Drink lots of fluid, especially water. Fluids can help flush bacteria from the urinary system. Water is best. Most healthy people should try to drink six to eight, 8-ounce glasses of fluid each day. (Some people need to drink less water because of certain conditions. For example, if you have kidney failure or heart disease, you should not drink this much fluid. Ask your health care provider how much fluid is healthy for you.)  Drink lots of fluid, especially water. Fluids can help flush bacteria from the urinary system. Water is best.

Both women and men should urinate shortly after sex to flush away bacteria that may have entered the urethra during sex.  Urinate after sex.

Wearing looser, cotton clothing will allow air to keep the area around the urethra dry. Tight-fitting jeans and nylon underwear should be avoided because they can trap moisture and help bacteria grow. Wear cotton underwear and loose-fitting clothes.

Some studies have shown that cranberry products make UTIs less likely, especially in people who get UTIs often. But in other studies, cranberry products did not help.', 'Because most UTIs are caused by bacteria, bacteria-fighting medications called antibiotics are the usual treatment. The type of antibiotic and length of treatment depend on the patients history and the type of bacteria causing the infection. Bladder infections may eventually get better on their own. But antibiotics can make the symptoms go away much more quickly. People usually feel better within a day or two of starting antibiotics. Drinking lots of fluids and urinating often may also speed healing. If needed, pain-killers can relieve the pain of a UTI. A heating pad on the back or abdomen may also help.

Managing these conditions can complicate treatment and affect the time it takes to recover. Also, older people's bodies metabolize, or break down, drugs at a slower rate than younger people, and this can have an effect on the way medicines are tolerated. For instance, some older adults may not be able to tolerate high doses of chemotherapy (cancer-fighting drugs) and radiation that are used to treat cancer.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283468.369181}
