Concentrates of clotting factor VIII (for hemophilia A) or clotting factor IX (for hemophilia B) are slowly dripped or injected into a vein. These infusions help replace the clotting factor that\\'s missing or low.\\n                \\nClotting factor concentrates can be made from human blood. The blood is treated to prevent the spread of diseases, such as hepatitis. With the current methods of screening and treating donated blood, the risk of getting an infectious disease from human clotting factors is very small.\\n                \\nTo further reduce the risk, you or your child can take clotting factor concentrates that aren\\'t made from human blood. These are called recombinant clotting factors. Clotting factors are easy to store, mix, and use at homeit only takes about 15 minutes to receive the factor.\\n                \\nYou may have replacement therapy on a regular basis to prevent bleeding. This is called preventive or prophylactic (PRO-fih-lac-tik) therapy. Or, you may only need replacement therapy to stop bleeding when it occurs. This use of the treatment, on an as-needed basis, is called demand therapy.\\n                \\nDemand therapy is less intensive and expensive than preventive therapy. However, there\\'s a risk that bleeding will cause damage before you receive the demand therapy.\\n                \\nComplications of Replacement Therapy\\n                \\nComplications of replacement therapy include:\\n                \\nDeveloping antibodies (proteins) that attack the clotting factor\\n                \\nDeveloping viral infections from human clotting factors\\n                \\nDamage to joints, muscles, or other parts of the body resulting from delays in treatment\\n                \\nAntibodies to the clotting factor. Antibodies can destroy the clotting factor before it has a chance to work. This is a very serious problem. It prevents the main treatment for hemophilia (replacement therapy) from working.\\n                \\nThese antibodies, also called inhibitors, develop in about 2030 percent of people who have severe hemophilia A. Inhibitors develop in 25 percent of people who have hemophilia B.\\n                \\nWhen antibodies develop, doctors may use larger doses of clotting factor or try different clotting factor sources. Sometimes the antibodies go away.\\n                \\nResearchers are studying new ways to deal with antibodies to clotting factors.\\n                \\nViruses from human clotting factors. Clotting factors made from human blood can carry the viruses that cause HIV/AIDS and hepatitis. However, the risk of getting an infectious disease from human clotting factors is very small due to:\\n                \\nCareful screening of blood donors\\n                \\nTesting of donated blood products\\n                \\nTreating donated blood products with a detergent and heat to destroy viruses\\n                \\nVaccinating people who have hemophilia for hepatitis A and B\\n                \\nDamage to joints, muscles, and other parts of the body. Delays in treatment can cause damage such as: \\n                \\nBleeding into a joint. If this happens many times, it can lead to changes in the shape of the joint and impair the joint\\'s function.\\n                \\nSwelling of the membrane around a joint.\\n                \\nPain, swelling, and redness of a joint.\\n                \\nPressure on a joint from swelling, which can destroy the joint.\\n                \\nHome Treatment With Replacement Therapy\\n                \\nYou can do both preventive (ongoing) and demand (as-needed) replacement therapy at home. Many people learn to do the infusions at home for their child or for themselves. Home treatment has several advantages:\\n                \\nYou or your child can get quicker treatment when bleeding happens. Early treatment lowers the risk of complications.\\n                \\nFewer visits to the doctor or emergency room are needed.\\n                \\nHome treatment costs less than treatment in a medical care setting.\\n                \\nHome treatment helps children accept treatment and take responsibility for their own health.\\n                \\nDiscuss options for home treatment with your doctor or your child\\'s doctor. A doctor or other health care provider can teach you the steps and safety procedures for home treatment. Hemophilia treatment centers are another good resource for learning about home treatment (discussed in \"Living With Hemophilia).\\n                \\nDoctors can surgically implant vein access devices to make it easier for you to access a vein for treatment with replacement therapy. These devices can be helpful if treatment occurs often. However, infections can be a problem with these devices. Your doctor can help you decide whether this type of device is right for you or your child.\\n                \\nOther Types of Treatment\\n                \\nDesmopressin\\n                \\nDesmopressin (DDAVP) is a man-made hormone used to treat people who have mild hemophilia A. DDAVP isn\\'t used to treat hemophilia B or severe hemophilia A.\\n                \\nDDAVP stimulates the release of stored factor VIII and von Willebrand factor; it also increases the level of these proteins in your blood. Von Willebrand factor carries and binds factor VIII, which can then stay in the bloodstream longer.\\n                \\nDDAVP usually is given by injection or as nasal spray. Because the effect of this medicine wears off if it\\'s used often, the medicine is given only in certain situations. For example, you may take this medicine prior to dental work or before playing certain sports to prevent or reduce bleeding.\\n                \\nAntifibrinolytic Medicines\\n                \\nAntifibrinolytic medicines (including tranexamic acid and epsilon aminocaproic acid) may be used with replacement therapy. They\\'re usually given as a pill, and they help keep blood clots from breaking down.\\n                \\nThese medicines most often are used before dental work or to treat bleeding from the mouth or nose or mild intestinal bleeding.\\n                \\nGene Therapy\\n                \\nResearchers are trying to find ways to correct the faulty genes that cause hemophilia. Gene therapy hasn\\'t yet developed to the point that it\\'s an accepted treatment for hemophilia. However, researchers continue to test gene therapy in clinical trials.\\n                \\nFor more information, go to the \"Clinical Trials\" section of this article.\\n                \\nTreatment of a Specific Bleeding Site\\n                \\nPain medicines, steroids, and physical therapy may be used to reduce pain and swelling in an affected joint. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist about which medicines are safe for you to take.\\n                \\nWhich Treatment Is Best for You?\\n                \\nThe type of treatment you or your child receives depends on several things, including how severe the hemophilia is, the activities you\\'ll be doing, and the dental or medical procedures you\\'ll be having.\\n                \\nMild hemophiliaReplacement therapy usually isn\\'t needed for mild hemophilia. Sometimes, though, DDAVP is given to raise the body\\'s level of factor VIII.\\n                \\nModerate hemophiliaYou may need replacement therapy only when bleeding occurs or to prevent bleeding that could occur when doing certain activities. Your doctor also may recommend DDAVP prior to having a procedure or doing an activity that increases the risk of bleeding.\\n                \\nSevere hemophiliaYou usually need replacement therapy to prevent bleeding that could damage your joints, muscles, or other parts of your body. Typically, replacement therapy is given at home two or three times a week. This preventive therapy usually is started in patients at a young age and may need to continue for life.\\n                \\nFor both types of hemophilia, getting quick treatment for bleeding is important. Quick treatment can limit damage to your body. If you or your child has hemophilia, learn to recognize signs of bleeding.\\n                \\nOther family members also should learn to watch for signs of bleeding in a child who has hemophilia. Children sometimes ignore signs of bleeding because they want to avoid the discomfort of treatment.', 'Espaol\\n                \\nIron-deficiency anemia is a common, easily treated condition that occurs if you don\\'t have enough iron in your body. Low iron levels usually are due to blood loss, poor diet, or an inability to absorb enough iron from food.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nIron-deficiency anemia is a common type of anemia. The term \"anemia\" usually refers to a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal number of red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen and remove carbon dioxide (a waste product) from your body.\\n                \\nAnemia also can occur if your red blood cells don\\'t contain enough hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin). Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.\\n                \\nIron-deficiency anemia usually develops over time if your body doesn\\'t have enough iron to build healthy red blood cells. Without enough iron, your body starts using the iron it has stored. Soon, the stored iron gets used up.\\n                \\nAfter the stored iron is gone, your body makes fewer red blood cells. The red blood cells it does make have less hemoglobin than normal.\\n                \\nIron-deficiency anemia can cause fatigue (tiredness), shortness of breath, chest pain, and other symptoms. Severe iron-deficiency anemia can lead to heart problems, infections, problems with growth and development in children, and other complications.\\n                \\nInfants and young children and women are the two groups at highest risk for iron-deficiency anemia.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nDoctors usually can successfully treat iron-deficiency anemia. Treatment will depend on the cause and severity of the condition. Treatments may include dietary changes, medicines, and surgery.\\n                \\nSevere iron-deficiency anemia may require treatment in a hospital, blood transfusions, iron injections, or intravenous iron therapy.', \"Not having enough iron in your body causes iron-deficiency anemia. Lack of iron usually is due to blood loss, poor diet, or an inability to absorb enough iron from food.\\n                \\nBlood Loss\\n                \\nWhen you lose blood, you lose iron. If you don't have enough iron stored in your body to make up for the lost iron, you'll develop iron-deficiency anemia.\\n                \\nIn women, long or heavy menstrual periods or bleeding fibroids in the uterus may cause low iron levels. Blood loss that occurs during childbirth is another cause of low iron levels in women.\\n                \\nInternal bleeding (bleeding inside the body) also may lead to iron-deficiency anemia. This type of blood loss isn't always obvious, and it may occur slowly. Some causes of internal bleeding are:\\n                \\nA bleeding ulcer, colon polyp, or colon cancer\\n                \\nRegular use of aspirin or other pain medicines, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (for example, ibuprofen and naproxen)\\n                \\nUrinary tract bleeding\\n                \\nBlood loss from severe injuries, surgery, or frequent blood drawings also can cause iron-deficiency anemia.\\n                \\nPoor Diet\\n                \\nThe best sources of iron are meat, poultry, fish, and iron-fortified foods (foods that have iron added). If you don't eat these foods regularly, or if you don't take an iron supplement, you're more likely to develop iron-deficiency anemia.\\n                \\nVegetarian diets can provide enough iron if you eat the right foods. For example, good nonmeat sources of iron include iron-fortified breads and cereals, beans, tofu, dried fruits, and spinach and other dark green leafy vegetables.\\n                \\nDuring some stages of life, such as pregnancy and childhood, it may be hard to get enough iron in your diet. This is because your need for iron increases during these times of growth and development.\\n                \\nInability To Absorb Enough Iron\\n                \\nEven if you have enough iron in your diet, your body may not be able to absorb it. This can happen if you have intestinal surgery (such as gastric bypass) or a disease of the intestine (such as Crohn's disease or celiac disease).\\n                \\nPrescription medicines that reduce acid in the stomach also can interfere with iron absorption.\", \"Infants and Young Children\\n                \\nInfants and young children need a lot of iron to grow and develop. The iron that full-term infants have stored in their bodies is used up in the first 4 to 6 months of life.\\n                \\nPremature and low-birth-weight babies (weighing less than 5.5 pounds) are at even greater risk for iron-deficiency anemia. These babies don't have as much iron stored in their bodies as larger, full-term infants.\\n                \\nIron-fortified baby food or iron supplements, when used properly, can help prevent iron-deficiency anemia in infants and young children. Talk with your child's doctor about your child's diet.\\n                \\nYoung children who drink a lot of cow's milk may be at risk for iron-deficiency anemia. Milk is low in iron, and too much milk may take the place of iron-rich foods in the diet. Too much milk also may prevent children's bodies from absorbing iron from other foods.\\n                \\nChildren who have lead in their blood also may be at risk for iron-deficiency anemia. Lead can interfere with the body's ability to make hemoglobin. Lead may get into the body from breathing in lead dust, eating lead in paint or soil, or drinking water that contains lead.\\n                \\nTeens\\n                \\nTeens are at risk for iron-deficiency anemia if they're underweight or have chronic (ongoing) illnesses. Teenage girls who have heavy periods also are at increased risk for the condition.\\n                \\nWomen\\n                \\nWomen of childbearing age are at higher risk for iron-deficiency anemia because of blood loss during their monthly periods. About 1 in 5 women of childbearing age has iron-deficiency anemia.\\n                \\nPregnant women also are at higher risk for the condition because they need twice as much iron as usual. The extra iron is needed for increased blood volume and for the fetus' growth.\\n                \\nAbout half of all pregnant women develop iron-deficiency anemia. The condition can increase a pregnant woman's risk for a premature or low-birth-weight baby.\\n                \\nAdults Who Have Internal Bleeding\\n                \\nAdults who have internal bleeding, such as intestinal bleeding, can develop iron-deficiency anemia due to blood loss. Certain conditions, such as colon cancer and bleeding ulcers, can cause blood loss. Some medicines, such as aspirin, also can cause internal bleeding.\\n                \\nOther At-Risk Groups\\n                \\nPeople who get kidney dialysis treatment may develop iron-deficiency anemia. This is because blood is lost during dialysis. Also, the kidneys are no longer able to make enough of a hormone that the body needs to produce red blood cells.\\n                \\nPeople who have gastric bypass surgery also may develop iron-deficiency anemia. This type of surgery can prevent the body from absorbing enough iron.\\n                \\nCertain eating patterns or habits may put you at higher risk for iron-deficiency anemia. This can happen if you:\\n                \\nFollow a diet that excludes meat and fish, which are the best sources of iron. However, vegetarian diets can provide enough iron if you eat the right foods. For example, good nonmeat sources of iron include iron-fortified breads and cereals, beans, tofu, dried fruits, and spinach and other dark green leafy vegetables.\\n                \\nEat poorly because of money, social, health, or other problems.\\n                \\nFollow a very low-fat diet over a long time. Some higher fat foods, like meat, are the best sources of iron.\\n                \\nFollow a high-fiber diet. Large amounts of fiber can slow the absorption of iron.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283466.190464}
