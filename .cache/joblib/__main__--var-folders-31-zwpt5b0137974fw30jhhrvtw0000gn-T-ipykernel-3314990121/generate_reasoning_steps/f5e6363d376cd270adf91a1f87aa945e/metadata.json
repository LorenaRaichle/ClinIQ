Diarrhea can lead to dehydration, malnutrition, and weight loss.  - A health care provider will recommend treatment for short bowel syndrome based on a patient's nutritional needs. Treatment may include      - nutritional support    - medications    - surgery    - intestinal transplant\", 'Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is a rare disorder that occurs when one or more tumors form in the pancreas and duodenum. The tumors, called gastrinomas, release large amounts of gastrin that cause the stomach to produce large amounts of acid. Normally, the body releases small amounts of gastrin after eating, which triggers the stomach to make gastric acid that helps break down food and liquid in the stomach. The extra acid causes peptic ulcers to form in the duodenum and elsewhere in the upper intestine.\\n                \\nThe tumors seen with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome are sometimes cancerous and may spread to other areas of the body.', 'The stomach, duodenum, and pancreas are digestive organs that break down food and liquid.\\n                \\n- The stomach stores swallowed food and liquid. The muscle action of the lower part of the stomach mixes the food and liquid with digestive juice. Partially digested food and liquid slowly move into the duodenum and are further broken down.  - The duodenum is the first part of the small intestinethe tube-shaped organ between the stomach and the large intestinewhere digestion of the food and liquid continues.  - The pancreas is an organ that makes the hormone insulin and enzymes for digestion. A hormone is a natural chemical produced in one part of the body and released into the blood to trigger or regulate particular functions of the body. Insulin helps cells throughout the body remove glucose, also called sugar, from blood and use it for energy. The pancreas is located behind the stomach and close to the duodenum.', 'Experts do not know the exact cause of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. About 25 to 30 percent of gastrinomas are caused by an inherited genetic disorder called multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1).1 MEN1 causes hormone-releasing tumors in the endocrine glands and the duodenum. Symptoms of MEN1 include increased hormone levels in the blood, kidney stones, diabetes, muscle weakness, weakened bones, and fractures.\\n                \\nMore information about MEN1 is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1.']}"}, "time": 1746283485.111189}
