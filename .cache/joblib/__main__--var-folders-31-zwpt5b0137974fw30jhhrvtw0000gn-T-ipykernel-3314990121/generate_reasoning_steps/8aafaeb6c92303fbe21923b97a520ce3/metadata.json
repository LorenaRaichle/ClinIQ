Researchers have described several major types of osteopetrosis, which are usually distinguished by their pattern of inheritance: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked. The different types of the disorder can also be distinguished by the severity of their signs and symptoms. Mutations in at least nine genes cause the various types of osteopetrosis.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Osteopetrosis autosomal dominant type 2? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Osteopetrosis autosomal dominant type 2. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Schwannomatosis is a rare form of neurofibromatosis that is primarily characterized by multiple schwannomas (benign tumors of the nervous system) in the absence of bilateral (affecting both sides) vestibular schwannomas. Signs and symptoms of the condition vary based on the size, location and number of schwannomas but may include pain; numbness; tingling; and/or weakness in the fingers and toes. Inherited forms of the disorder account for only 15 percent of all cases. In some of these families, schwannomatosis is caused by changes (mutations) in the SMARCB1 or LZTR1 genes; in other cases, the exact underlying cause is unknown. When inherited, the condition is passed down in an autosomal dominant manner with highly variable expressivity and reduced penetrance. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person but may include medications and/or surgery.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Schwannomatosis? Signs and symptoms of the schwannomatosis often develop during adulthood between ages 25 and 30. Affected people generally have multiple schwannomas, which are benign tumors of the nervous system. In schwannomatosis, these tumors can grow along any nerve in the body, although they are less common on the vestibular nerve (vestibular schwannomas, also known as acoustic neuromas). People with vestibular schwannomas, especially those with tumors affecting the vestibular nerve on both sides of the head (bilateral), may have neurofibromatosis type 2 instead. The signs and symptoms associated with schwannomatosis vary based on the size and location of the schwannomas. The most common symptom is chronic pain, which can develop as a growing schwannoma presses on nerves or surrounding tissues. Some people may develop a mass if the schwannomas is located just beneath the skin. Others can experience neurological symptoms such as numbness; tingling; and/or weakness in the fingers and toes. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Schwannomatosis.
