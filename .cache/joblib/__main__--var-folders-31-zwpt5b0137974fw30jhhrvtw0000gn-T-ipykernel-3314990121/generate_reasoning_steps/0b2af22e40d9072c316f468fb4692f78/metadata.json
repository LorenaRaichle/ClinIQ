Breast cancer kills more women in the United States than any cancer except lung cancer. No one knows why some women get breast cancer, but there are a number of risk factors. Risks that you cannot change include       - Age - the chance of getting breast cancer rises as a woman gets older     - Genes - there are two genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, that greatly increase the risk. Women who have family members with breast or ovarian cancer may wish to be tested.     - Personal factors - beginning periods before age 12 or going through menopause after age 55       Other risks include being overweight, using hormone replacement therapy (also called menopausal hormone therapy), taking birth control pills, drinking alcohol, not having children or having your first child after age 35 or having dense breasts.    Symptoms of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in size or shape of the breast or discharge from a nipple. Breast self-exam and mammography can help find breast cancer early when it is most treatable. Treatment may consist of radiation, lumpectomy, mastectomy, chemotherapy and hormone therapy.    Men can have breast cancer, too, but the number of cases is small.    NIH: National Cancer Institute', 'Summary : Mastering new skills such as how to walk, talk, and use the potty are developmental milestones. It is exciting to watch your toddler learn new skills. The normal development of children aged 1-3 can be broken down into the following areas:       - Gross motor - walking, running, climbing    - Fine motor - feeding themselves, drawing    - Sensory - seeing, hearing, tasting, touching, and smelling    - Language - saying single words, then sentences    - Social - playing with others, taking turns, doing fantasy play       Toddlers do not develop at the same rate. There is a wide range of what is considered \"normal.\" Your child may be ahead in some areas and slightly behind in others. If you are worried about possible delays, talk to your child\\'s health care provider.', 'Testicles, or testes, make male hormones and sperm. They are two egg-shaped organs inside the scrotum, the loose sac of skin behind the penis. You can get cancer in one or both testicles.    Testicular cancer mainly affects young men between the ages of 20 and 39. It is also more common in men who       - Have had abnormal testicle development    - Have had an undescended testicle    - Have a family history of the cancer       Symptoms include pain, swelling, or lumps in your testicles or groin area. Doctors use a physical exam, lab tests, imaging tests, and a biopsy to diagnose testicular cancer. Most cases can be treated, especially if found early. Treatment options include surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy. Regular exams after treatment are important.    Treatments may also cause infertility. If you may want children later on, you should consider sperm banking before treatment.    NIH: National Cancer Institute', 'Summary : How well you and your doctor communicate with each other is one of the most important parts of getting good health care. Being prepared can help make the most of your visit. Here are some things you can bring:       - Lists of your concerns, any allergies and all the medicines, herbs, or vitamins you take    - A description of symptoms - when they started, what makes them better     - A trusted friend or family member    - A way to take notes during your appointment       Make sure you understand your diagnosis and any treatments. Ask your health care provider to write down his or her instructions to you. If you still have trouble understanding, ask where you can go for more information.']}"}, "time": 1746283466.994731}
