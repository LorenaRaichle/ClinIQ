Treatment for nodular nonsuppurative panniculitis (NNP) generally aims at controlling and relieving the symptoms that an individual has. Before treatment is initiated, a work-up should be completed to determine whether the condition is secondary to another underlying disorder. If there is an underlying disorder, treatment of this disorder may relieve the symptoms of NNP. In some cases, skin lesions heal spontaneously (remission) but the lesions often later return. There is no treatment method found to be effective for all individuals with NNP. Medications used to treat the condition may include systemic steroids (such as prednisone) to suppress sudden attacks; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to reduce fever and other signs of malaise; and/or immunosuppressive drugs. Relief of symptoms in some affected individuals has also been reported with fibrinolytic agents (medications that help prevent blood clots), hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine, thalidomide, cyclophosphamide, tetracycline, cyclosporin, mycophenolate, and clofazimine. More detailed information about the management of nodular nonsuppurative panniculitis is available on the Treatment and Medication sections of the Medscape Reference Web site.', 'Buschke Lowenstein tumor is a tumor that most commonly occurs near the penis or anus.  This tumor often looks like a large genital wart; it tends to grow slowly, but can sometimes grow very large and spread into surrounding tissues.  These tumors rarely spread to other parts of the body.  Treatment of these tumors begins with removal by surgery.  Chemotherapy and radiation therapy have also been shown to be effective treatments for this tumor type.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Spastic paraplegia 5B? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Spastic paraplegia 5B. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal recessive inheritance - Spastic paraplegia - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Stratton-Garcia-Young syndrome?
