Ticks are small bloodsucking parasites. Many species transmit diseases to animals and people. Some of the diseases you can get from a tick bite are Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia.     Some ticks are so small that they can be difficult to see. Ticks may get on you if you walk through areas where they live, such as tall grass, leaf litter or shrubs.     Tick-borne diseases occur worldwide, including in your own backyard. To help protect yourself and your family, you should       -  Use a chemical repellent with DEET, permethrin or picaridin    -  Wear light-colored protective clothing     -  Tuck pant legs into socks     -  Avoid tick-infested areas     -  Check yourself, your children and your pets daily for ticks and carefully remove any ticks you find', 'Summary : You have more calcium in your body than any other mineral. Calcium has many important jobs. The body stores more than 99 percent of its calcium in the bones and teeth to help make and keep them strong. The rest is throughout the body in blood, muscle and the fluid between cells. Your body needs calcium to help muscles and blood vessels contract and expand, to secrete hormones and enzymes and to send messages through the nervous system.     It is important to get plenty of calcium in the foods you eat. Foods rich in calcium include       - Dairy products such as milk, cheese, and yogurt    - Leafy, green vegetables    - Fish with soft bones that you eat, such as canned sardines and salmon    - Calcium-enriched foods such as breakfast cereals, fruit juices, soy and rice drinks, and tofu. Check the product labels.       The exact amount of calcium you need depends on your age and other factors. Growing children and teenagers need more calcium than young adults. Older women need plenty of calcium to prevent osteoporosis. People who do not eat enough high-calcium foods should take a calcium supplement.    NIH: National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements', 'Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) causes pain in the shoulder, arm, and neck. It happens when the nerves or blood vessels just below your neck are compressed, or squeezed. The compression can happen between the muscles of your neck and shoulder or between the first rib and collarbone. You may feel burning, tingling, and numbness along your arm, hand, and fingers. If a nerve is compressed, you may also feel weakness in your hand. If a vein is compressed, your hand might be sensitive to cold, or turn pale or bluish. Your arm might swell and tire easily.    TOS is more common in women. It usually starts between 20 and 50 years of age. Doctors do nerve and imaging studies to diagnose it.    There are many causes of TOS, including       - Injury    - Anatomical defects    - Tumors that press on nerves    - Poor posture that causes nerve compression    - Pregnancy    - Repetitive arm and shoulder movements and activity, such as from playing certain sports       Treatment depends on what caused your TOS. Medicines, physical therapy, and relaxation might help. Surgery may also be an option. Most people recover.    NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Summary : Ozone is a gas. It can be good or bad, depending on where it is. \"Good\" ozone occurs naturally about 10 to 30 miles above the Earth\\'s surface. It shields us from the sun\\'s ultraviolet rays. Part of the good ozone layer is gone. Man-made chemicals have destroyed it. Without enough good ozone, people may get too much ultraviolet radiation. This may increase the risk of skin cancer, cataracts, and immune system problems.    \"Bad\" ozone is at ground level. It forms when pollutants from cars, factories, and other sources react chemically with sunlight. It is the main ingredient in smog. It is usually worst in the summer. Breathing bad ozone can be harmful. It can cause coughing, throat irritation, worsening of asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema. It can lead to permanent lung damage, if you are regularly exposed to it.    Environmental Protection Agency']}"}, "time": 1746283467.061665}
