The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Hyperostosis corticalis generalisata, benign form of Worth with torus palatinus.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency?

The hypothalamus is a part of the brain where certain functions such as sleep cycles and body temperature are regulated. The pituitary is a gland that makes hormones that affect growth and the functions of other glands in the body. Froehlich syndrome is acquired (i.e., not thought to be inherited or genetic). This syndrome appears to affect males more commonly. The term 'Froelich syndrome' is rarely used today.\", 'What are the signs and symptoms of Froelich syndrome? Signs and symptoms of Froelich syndrome include obesity, small testes, delay in the onset of puberty, short stature (compared to other family members of the same sex), malformed or undersized fingernails, and headaches. Some children with Froehlich syndrome may have mental retardation, difficulties with vision, and in rare cases diabetes. Other symptoms of the syndrome may include excessive thirst, excessive urination, and very delicate skin.']}"}, "time": 1746283458.6429539}
