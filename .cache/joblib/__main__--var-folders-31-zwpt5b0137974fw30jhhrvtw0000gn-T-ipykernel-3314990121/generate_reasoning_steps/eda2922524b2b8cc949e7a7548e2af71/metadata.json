There are several types of meningitis. The most common is viral meningitis, which you get when a virus enters the body through the nose or mouth and travels to the brain. Bacterial meningitis is rare, but can be deadly. It usually starts with bacteria that cause a cold-like infection. It can block blood vessels in the brain and lead to stroke and brain damage. It can also harm other organs. Pneumococcal infections and meningococcal infections can cause bacterial meningitis.    Anyone can get meningitis, but it is more common in people whose bodies have trouble fighting infections. Meningitis can progress rapidly. You should seek medical care quickly if you have       - A sudden fever     - A severe headache     - A stiff neck        Early treatment can help prevent serious problems, including death. Vaccines can prevent some of the bacterial infections that cause meningitis. Parents of adolescents and students living in college dorms should talk to a doctor about the vaccination.     NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', \"Summary : The field of ethics studies principles of right and wrong. There is hardly an area in medicine that doesn't have an ethical aspect. For example, there are ethical issues relating to        - End of life care: Should a patient receive nutrition? What about advance directives and resuscitation orders?    - Abortion: When does life begin? Is it ethical to terminate a pregnancy with a birth defect?    - Genetic and prenatal testing: What happens if you are a carrier of a defect? What if testing shows that your unborn baby has a defect?    - Birth control: Should it be available to minors?    - Is it ethical to harvest embryonic stem cells to treat diseases?    - Organ donation: Must a relative donate an organ to a sick relative?    - Your personal health information: who has access to your records?    - Patient rights: Do you have the right to refuse treatment?    - When you talk with your doctor, is it ethical for her to withhold information from you or your family?\", 'Summary : Cocaine is a white powder. It can be snorted up the nose or mixed with water and injected with a needle. Cocaine can also be made into small white rocks, called crack. Crack is smoked in a small glass pipe.    Cocaine speeds up your whole body. You may feel full of energy, happy, and excited. But then your mood can change. You can become angry, nervous, and afraid that someone\\'s out to get you. You might do things that make no sense. After the \"high\" of the cocaine wears off, you can \"crash\" and feel tired and sad for days. You also get a strong craving to take the drug again to try to feel better.    No matter how cocaine is taken, it is dangerous. Some of the most common serious problems include heart attack and stroke. You are also at risk for HIV/AIDS and hepatitis, from sharing needles or having unsafe sex. Cocaine is more dangerous when combined with other drugs or alcohol.    It is easy to lose control over cocaine use and become addicted. Then, even if you get treatment, it can be hard to stay off the drug. People who stopped using cocaine can still feel strong cravings for the drug, sometimes even years later.    NIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse', \"Although breast cancer is much more common in women, men can get it too. It happens most often to men between the ages of 60 and 70.    Breast lumps usually aren't cancer. However, most men with breast cancer have lumps. Other breast symptoms can include       - Dimpled or puckered skin    - A red, scaly nipple or skin    - Fluid discharge       Risk factors for male breast cancer include exposure to radiation, a family history of breast cancer, and having high estrogen levels, which can happen with diseases like cirrhosis or Klinefelter's syndrome.    Treatment for male breast cancer is usually a mastectomy, which is surgery to remove the breast. Other treatments include radiation, chemotherapy and/or hormone therapy.
