Chromosomal rearrangements that lead to a PDGFRB fusion gene are somatic mutations, which are mutations acquired during a person's lifetime and present only in certain cells. The somatic mutation occurs initially in a single cell, which continues to grow and divide, producing a group of cells with the same mutation (a clonal population).\", 'These resources address the diagnosis or management of PDGFRB-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia:  - Cancer.Net: Leukemia--Eosinophilic: Treatment  - Genetic Testing Registry: Myeloproliferative disorder, chronic, with eosinophilia  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Eosinophil Count--Absolute  - Seattle Cancer Care Alliance: Hypereosinophilia   These resources from MedlinePlus offer information about the diagnosis and management of various health conditions:  - Diagnostic Tests  - Drug Therapy  - Surgery and Rehabilitation  - Genetic Counseling   - Palliative Care', 'Persistent Mllerian duct syndrome is a disorder of sexual development that affects males. Males with this disorder have normal male reproductive organs, though they also have a uterus and fallopian tubes, which are female reproductive organs. The uterus and fallopian tubes are derived from a structure called the Mllerian duct during development of the fetus. The Mllerian duct usually breaks down during early development in males, but it is retained in those with persistent Mllerian duct syndrome. Affected individuals have the normal chromosomes of a male (46,XY) and normal external male genitalia.  The first noted signs and symptoms in males with persistent Mllerian duct syndrome are usually undescended testes (cryptorchidism) or soft out-pouchings in the lower abdomen (inguinal hernias). The uterus and fallopian tubes are typically discovered when surgery is performed to treat these conditions.  The testes and female reproductive organs can be located in unusual positions in persistent Mllerian duct syndrome. Occasionally, both testes are undescended (bilateral cryptorchidism) and the uterus is in the pelvis. More often, one testis has descended into the scrotum normally, and one has not. Sometimes, the descended testis pulls the fallopian tube and uterus into the track through which it has descended. This creates a condition called hernia uteri inguinalis, a form of inguinal hernia. In other cases, the undescended testis from the other side of the body is also pulled into the same track, forming an inguinal hernia. This condition, called transverse testicular ectopia, is common in people with persistent Mllerian duct syndrome.  Other effects of persistent Mllerian duct syndrome may include the inability to father children (infertility) or blood in the semen (hematospermia). Also, the undescended testes may break down (degenerate) or develop cancer if left untreated.', 'Persistent Mllerian duct syndrome is a rare disorder; however, the prevalence of the condition is unknown.']}"}, "time": 1746283453.27011}
