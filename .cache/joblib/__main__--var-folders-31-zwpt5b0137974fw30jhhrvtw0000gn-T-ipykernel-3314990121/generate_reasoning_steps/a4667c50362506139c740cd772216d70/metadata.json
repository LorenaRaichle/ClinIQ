It is when a man has trouble getting or keeping an erection. ED becomes more common as you get older. But it's not a natural part of aging.    Some people have trouble speaking with their doctors about sex. But if you have ED, you should tell your doctor. ED can be a sign of health problems. It may mean your blood vessels are clogged. It may mean you have nerve damage from diabetes. If you don't see your doctor, these problems will go untreated.     Your doctor can offer several new treatments for ED. For many men, the answer is as simple as taking a pill. Getting more exercise, losing weight, or stopping smoking may also help.     NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\", \"Heel problems are common and can be painful. Often, they result from too much stress on your heel bone and the tissues that surround it. That stress can come from       - Injuries    - Bruises that you get walking, running or jumping     - Wearing shoes that don't fit or aren't made well    - Being overweight       These can lead to tendinitis, bursitis, and fasciitis, which are all types of inflammation of the tissues that surround your heel. Over time the stress can cause bone spurs and deformities. Certain diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and gout, can also lead to heel problems. Treatments for heel problems might include rest, medicines, exercises, taping, and special shoes. Surgery is rarely needed.\", 'Summary : E-cigarettes, or electronic cigarettes, are battery-operated smoking devices. They often look like cigarettes, but work differently. Using an e-cigarette is called vaping. The user puffs on the mouthpiece of a cartridge. This causes a vaporizer to heat the liquid inside the cartridge. The liquid contains nicotine, flavorings, and other chemicals. The heated liquid turns into the vapor that is inhaled.    Some people think that e-cigarettes are safer than cigarettes, and that they can be used to help people quit smoking. But not much is known about the health risks of using them, or whether they do help people quit smoking. However we do know about some dangers of e-cigarettes:       - They contain nicotine, which is addictive    - They contain other potentially harmful chemicals    - There is a link between e-cigarette use and tobacco cigarette use in teens    - The liquid in e-cigarettes can cause nicotine poisoning if someone drinks, sniffs, or touches it        NIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse', \"Poor health can contribute to being homeless, and being homeless can lead to poor health. Limited access to health care can make it worse. That's why the health of homeless people in the United States is worse than that of the general population. Common health problems include       - Mental health problems    - Substance abuse problems    - Bronchitis and pneumonia    - Problems caused by being outdoors    - Wound and skin infections       Many homeless women are victims of domestic or sexual abuse. Homeless children have high rates of emotional and behavioral problems, often from having witnessed abuse.    Help such as shelters, health centers, and free meals are available.
