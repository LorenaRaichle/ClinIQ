Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Nijmegen breakage syndrome?

Some people affected by the condition have no associated signs and symptoms while others experience symptoms of androgen (male hormone) excess. Women with NCAH are generally born with normal female genitalia. Later in life, signs and symptoms of the condition can vary but may include hirsutism, frontal baldness, delayed menarche (first period), menstrual irregularities, and infertility. Little has been published about males with NCAH. They may have early beard growth and relatively small testes. Typically, they have normal sperm counts. NCAH is caused by changes (mutations) in the CYP21A2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is only necessary in people who are symptomatic and may include a glucocorticoid called dexamethasone.']}"}, "time": 1746283458.4295008}
