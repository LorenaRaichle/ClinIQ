The esophagus carries food and liquids from the mouth to the stomach, which slowly pumps them into the small and large intestines. Abdominal adhesions can kink, twist, or pull the small and large intestines out of place, causing an intestinal obstruction. Intestinal obstruction, also called a bowel obstruction, results in the partial or complete blockage of movement of food or stool through the intestines.', 'Abdominal surgery is the most frequent cause of abdominal adhesions. Surgery-related causes include\\n                \\n- cuts involving internal organs   - handling of internal organs  - drying out of internal organs and tissues  - contact of internal tissues with foreign materials, such as gauze, surgical gloves, and stitches  - blood or blood clots that were not rinsed away during surgery\\n                \\nAbdominal adhesions can also result from inflammation not related to surgery, including\\n                \\n- appendix rupture  - radiation treatment  - gynecological infections  - abdominal infections\\n                \\nRarely, abdominal adhesions form without apparent cause.', 'Of patients who undergo abdominal surgery, 93 percent develop abdominal adhesions.1 Surgery in the lower abdomen and pelvis, including bowel and gynecological operations, carries an even greater chance of abdominal adhesions. Abdominal adhesions can become larger and tighter as time passes, sometimes causing problems years after surgery.', 'In most cases, abdominal adhesions do not cause symptoms. When symptoms are present, chronic abdominal pain is the most common.']}"}, "time": 1746283485.068442}
