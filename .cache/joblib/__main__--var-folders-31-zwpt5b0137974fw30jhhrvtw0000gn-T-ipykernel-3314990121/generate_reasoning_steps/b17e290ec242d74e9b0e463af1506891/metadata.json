A diagnosis of celiac artery compression syndrome might be suspected in middle aged (40-60) female patients with a triad of symptoms including abdominal pain after eating, weight loss, and abdominal bruit (abnormal sound of a blood vessel when blocked or narrowed). Abdominal imaging is used to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other similarly presenting disorders. Imaging methodologies might include: CT angiography, MRI, ultrasound, and arteriography.', 'How might celiac artery compression syndrome be treated? Surgery is currently the only treatment option for celiac artery compression syndrome. Surgery typically involves decompression of the celiac artery by dividing the fibers of the median arcuate ligament and celiac plexus (network of nerves in the abdomen). Surgical decompression might additionally be combined with stent placement, angioplasty, or vascular reconstruction of the celiac artery.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Radio renal syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Radio renal syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal form of the vertebral bodies 90% Abnormality of the elbow 90% Abnormality of the palate 90% Abnormality of the pleura 90% Abnormality of the ribs 90% Brachydactyly syndrome 90% Convex nasal ridge 90% Depressed nasal bridge 90% Downturned corners of mouth 90% Micromelia 90% Multicystic kidney dysplasia 90% Renal hypoplasia/aplasia 90% Respiratory insufficiency 90% Short neck 90% Short stature 90% Abnormality of chromosome stability - Absent radius - Absent thumb - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Ectopic kidney - External ear malformation - Renal agenesis - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Lipodystrophy, familial partial, type 2?
