The cause of SAPHO syndrome is unknown and treatment is focused on managing symptoms.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of SAPHO syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for SAPHO syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Bone pain 90% Chest pain 90% Hyperostosis 90% Increased bone mineral density 90% Osteolysis 90% Abnormality of the sacroiliac joint 50% Acne 50% Arthritis 50% Osteomyelitis 50% Palmoplantar pustulosis 50% Psoriasis 50% Abdominal pain 7.5% Cranial nerve paralysis 7.5% Inflammation of the large intestine 7.5% Malabsorption 7.5% Recurrent fractures 7.5% Skin rash 7.5% Skin ulcer 7.5% Thrombophlebitis 7.5% Vasculitis 7.5% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'How might SAPHO syndrome be treated? There is no specific treatment plan for SAPHO syndrome. It can be a chronic condition but sometimes eventually heals on its own. Joint pain may be managed with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and prescription vitamin A is used to treat the acne. Other drugs that may be used include: Colchicine Topical corticosteroids Systemic corticosteroids Methotrexate Calcitonin Bisphosphonates Infliximab Etanercept.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Microcephalic primordial dwarfism, Montreal type?
