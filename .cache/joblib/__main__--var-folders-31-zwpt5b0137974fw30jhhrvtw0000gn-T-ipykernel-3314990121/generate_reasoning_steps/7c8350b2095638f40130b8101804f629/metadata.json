The two forms of dialysis are hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Most children with acute kidney injury need dialysis for a short time only.\\n                \\nTreating Chronic Kidney Disease\\n                \\nSome children may sustain significant kidney damage that slowly develops into CKD. Children who develop CKD must receive treatment to replace the work the kidneys do. The two types of treatment are dialysis and transplantation.\\n                \\nIn most cases, health care providers treat CKD with a kidney transplant. A kidney transplant is surgery to place a healthy kidney from someone who has just died or a living donor, most often a family member, into a person's body to take over the job of the failing kidney. Though some children receive a kidney transplant before their kidneys fail completely, many children begin with dialysis to stay healthy until they can have a transplant.\\n                \\nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Treatment Methods for Kidney Failure in Children.\", \"Parents and caregivers can help prevent childhood hemolytic uremic syndrome due to E. coli O157:H7 by\\n                \\n- avoiding unclean swimming areas  - avoiding unpasteurized milk, juice, and cider  - cleaning utensils and food surfaces often  - cooking meat to an internal temperature of at least 160 F  - defrosting meat in the microwave or refrigerator  - keeping children out of pools if they have had diarrhea  - keeping raw foods separate  - washing hands before eating  - washing hands well after using the restroom and after changing diapers\\n                \\nWhen a child is taking medications that may cause hemolytic uremic syndrome, it is important that the parent or caretaker watch for symptoms and report any changes in the child's condition to the health care provider as soon as possible.\", 'At the beginning of the illness, children with hemolytic uremic syndrome may need IV nutrition or supplements to help maintain fluid balance in the body.
