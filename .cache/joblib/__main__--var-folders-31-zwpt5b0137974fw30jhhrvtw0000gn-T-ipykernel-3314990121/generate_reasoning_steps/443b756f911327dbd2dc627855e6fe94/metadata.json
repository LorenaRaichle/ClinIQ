It typically affects women in the reproductive age group. The size of the lesion varies, but small microscopic PASH is much more common than larger masses. Microscopic PASH is often an incidental finding in breast biopsies done for other non-cancerous or cancerous lesions. Tumorous PASH presents as a firm, painless breast mass or a dense region on a mammogram.', \"Is treatment available for pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia (PASH)? Surgical removal of the PASH lesions has been performed in some individuals. A wide margin around the mass may be removed to prevent recurrence. Although PASH lesions often grow over time and may recur, they are neither associated with malignancy (cancer) nor considered to be premalignant (pre-cancerous). According to the medical text, CONN's Current Therapy 2007, approximately 7 percent of people experience a recurrence of PASH.\", 'What are the signs and symptoms of His bundle tachycardia? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for His bundle tachycardia. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Arrhythmia 90% Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 50% Neoplasm of the heart 7.5% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Lethal congenital contracture syndrome 1?
