The formation of scar tissue is called fibrosis.\\n                \\nAs the lung tissue thickens, your lungs can\\'t properly move oxygen into your bloodstream. As a result, your brain and other organs don\\'t get the oxygen they need. (For more information, go to the \"How the Lungs Work\" section of this article.)\\n                \\nSometimes doctors can find out what\\'s causing fibrosis. But in most cases, they can\\'t find a cause. They call these cases idiopathic (id-ee-o-PATH-ick) pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).\\n                \\nIPF is a serious disease that usually affects middle-aged and older adults. IPF varies from person to person. In some people, fibrosis happens quickly. In others, the process is much slower. In some people, the disease stays the same for years.\\n                \\nIPF has no cure yet. Many people live only about 3 to 5 years after diagnosis. The most common cause of death related to IPF is respiratory failure. Other causes of death include pulmonary hypertension (HI-per-TEN-shun), heart failure, pulmonary embolism (EM-bo-lizm), pneumonia (nu-MO-ne-ah), and lung cancer.\\n                \\nGenetics may play a role in causing IPF. If more than one member of your family has IPF, the disease is called familial IPF.\\n                \\nResearch has helped doctors learn more about IPF. As a result, they can more quickly diagnose the disease now than in the past. Also, researchers are studying several medicines that may slow the progress of IPF. These efforts may improve the lifespan and quality of life for people who have the disease.', 'Sometimes doctors can find out what is causing pulmonary fibrosis (lung scarring). For example, exposure to environmental pollutants and certain medicines can cause the disease.\\n                \\nEnvironmental pollutants include inorganic dust (silica and hard metal dusts) and organic dust (bacteria and animal proteins).\\n                \\nMedicines that are known to cause pulmonary fibrosis in some people include nitrofurantoin (an antibiotic), amiodarone (a heart medicine), methotrexate and bleomycin (both chemotherapy medicines), and many other medicines.\\n                \\nIn most cases, however, the cause of lung scarring isnt known. These cases are called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). With IPF, doctors think that something inside or outside of the lungs attacks them again and again over time.\\n                \\nThese attacks injure the lungs and scar the tissue inside and between the air sacs. This makes it harder for oxygen to pass through the air sac walls into the bloodstream.\\n                \\nThe following factors may increase your risk of IPF:\\n                \\nCigarette smoking\\n                \\nViral infections, including Epstein-Barr virus (which causes mononucleosis), influenza A virus, hepatitis C virus, HIV, and herpes virus 6\\n                \\nGenetics also may play a role in causing IPF. Some families have at least two members who have IPF.\\n                \\nResearchers have found that 9 out of 10 people who have IPF also have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD is a condition in which acid from your stomach backs up into your throat.\\n                \\nSome people who have GERD may regularly breathe in tiny drops of acid from their stomachs. The acid can injure their lungs and lead to IPF. More research is needed to confirm this theory.', \"The signs and symptoms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) develop over time. They may not even begin to appear until the disease has done serious damage to your lungs. Once they occur, they're likely to get worse over time.\\n                \\nThe most common signs and symptoms are:\\n                \\nShortness of breath. This usually is the main symptom of IPF. At first, you may be short of breath only during exercise. Over time, you'll likely feel breathless even at rest.\\n                \\nA dry, hacking cough that doesn't get better. Over time, you may have repeated bouts of coughing that you can't control.\\n                \\nOther signs and symptoms that you may develop over time include:\\n                \\nRapid, shallow breathing\\n                \\nGradual, unintended weight loss\\n                \\nFatigue (tiredness) or malaise (a general feeling of being unwell)\\n                \\nAching muscles and joints\\n                \\nClubbing, which is the widening and rounding of the tips of the fingers or toes\\n                \\nClubbing\\n                \\n\\n                \\nIPF may lead to other medical problems, including a collapsed lung, lung infections, blood clots in the lungs, and lung cancer.\\n                \\nAs the disease worsens, you may develop other potentially life-threatening conditions, including respiratory failure, pulmonary hypertension, and heart failure.\", \"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) causes the same kind of scarring and symptoms as some other lung diseases. This makes it hard to diagnose.\\n                \\nSeeking medical help as soon as you have symptoms is important. If possible, seek care from a pulmonologist. This is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating lung problems.\\n                \\nYour doctor will diagnose IPF based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. Tests can help rule out other causes of your symptoms and show how badly your lungs are damaged.\\n                \\nMedical History\\n                \\nYour doctor may ask about:\\n                \\nYour age\\n                \\nYour history of smoking\\n                \\nThings in the air at your job or elsewhere that could irritate your lungs\\n                \\nYour hobbies\\n                \\nYour history of legal and illegal drug use\\n                \\nOther medical conditions that you have\\n                \\nYour family's medical history\\n                \\nHow long you've had symptoms\\n                \\nDiagnostic Tests\\n                \\nNo single test can diagnose IPF. Your doctor may recommend several of the following tests.\\n                \\nChest X Ray\\n                \\nA chest x ray is a painless test that creates a picture of the structures in your chest, such as your heart and lungs. This test can show shadows that suggest scar tissue. However, many people who have IPF have normal chest x rays at the time they're diagnosed.\\n                \\nHigh-Resolution Computed Tomography\\n                \\nA high-resolution computed tomography scan, or HRCT scan, is an x ray that provides sharper and more detailed pictures than a standard chest x ray.\\n                \\nHRCT can show scar tissue and how much lung damage you have. This test can help your doctor spot IPF at an early stage or rule it out. HRCT also can help your doctor decide how likely you are to respond to treatment.\\n                \\nLung Function Tests\\n                \\nYour doctor may suggest a breathing test called spirometry(spi-ROM-eh-tree) to find out how much lung damage you have. This test measures how much air you can blow out of your lungs after taking a deep breath. Spirometry also measures how fast you can breathe the air out.\\n                \\nIf you have a lot of lung scarring, you won't be able to breathe out a normal amount of air.\\n                \\nPulse Oximetry\\n                \\nFor this test, your doctor attaches a small sensor to your finger or ear. The sensor uses light to estimate how much oxygen is in your blood.\\n                \\nArterial Blood Gas Test\\n                \\nFor this test, your doctor takes a blood sample from an artery, usually in your wrist. The sample is sent to a laboratory, where its oxygen and carbon dioxide levels are measured.\\n                \\nThis test is more accurate than pulse oximetry. The blood sample also can be tested to see whether an infection is causing your symptoms.\\n                \\nSkin Test for Tuberculosis\\n                \\nFor this test, your doctor injects a substance under the top layer of skin on one of your arms. This substance reacts to tuberculosis (TB). If you have a positive reaction, a small hard lump will develop at the injection site 48 to 72 hours after the test. This test is done to rule out TB.\\n                \\nExercise Testing\\n                \\nExercise testing shows how well your lungs move oxygen and carbon dioxide in and out of your bloodstream when you're active. During this test, you walk or pedal on an exercise machine for a few minutes.\\n                \\nAn EKG(electrocardiogram) checks your heart rate, a blood pressure cuff checks your blood pressure, and a pulse oximeter shows how much oxygen is in your blood.\\n                \\nYour doctor may place a catheter (a flexible tube) in an artery in one of your arms to draw blood samples. These samples will provide a more precise measure of the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in your blood.\\n                \\nYour doctor also may ask you to breathe into a tube that measures oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in your blood.\\n                \\nLung Biopsy\\n                \\nFor a lung biopsy, your doctor will take samples of lung tissue from several places in your lungs. The samples are examined under a microscope. A lung biopsy is the best way for your doctor to diagnose IPF.\\n                \\nThis procedure can help your doctor rule out other conditions, such as sarcoidosis (sar-koy-DO-sis), cancer, or infection. Lung biopsy also can show your doctor how far your disease has advanced.\\n                \\nDoctors use several procedures to get lung tissue samples.\\n                \\nVideo-assisted thoracoscopy (thor-ah-KOS-ko-pee). This is the most common procedure used to get lung tissue samples. Your doctor inserts a small tube with an attached light and camera into your chest through small cuts between your ribs. The tube is called an endoscope.\\n                \\nThe endoscope provides a video image of the lungs and allows your doctor to collect tissue samples. This procedure must be done in a hospital. You'll be given medicine to make you sleep during the procedure.\\n                \\nBronchoscopy (bron-KOS-ko-pee). For a bronchoscopy, your doctor passes a thin, flexible tube through your nose or mouth, down your throat, and into your airways. At the tube's tip are a light and mini-camera. They allow your doctor to see your windpipe and airways.\\n                \\nYour doctor then inserts a forceps through the tube to collect tissue samples. You'll be given medicine to help you relax during the procedure.\\n                \\nBronchoalveolar lavage (BRONG-ko-al-VE-o-lar lah-VAHZH). During bronchoscopy, your doctor may inject a small amount of salt water (saline) through the tube into your lungs. This fluid washes the lungs and helps bring up cells from the area around the air sacs. These cells are examined under a microscope.\\n                \\nThoracotomy (thor-ah-KOT-o-me). For this procedure, your doctor removes a few small pieces of lung tissue through a cut in the chest wall between your ribs. Thoracotomy is done in a hospital. You'll be given medicine to make you sleep during the procedure.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283466.358224}
