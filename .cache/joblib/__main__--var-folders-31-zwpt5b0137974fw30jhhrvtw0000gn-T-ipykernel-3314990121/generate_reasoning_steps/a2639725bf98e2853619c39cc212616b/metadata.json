Each year in the United States, approximately 795,000 people have a stroke. About 610,000 of these are first or new strokes. On average, one American dies from stroke every four minutes. Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States, and causes more serious long-term disabilities than any other disease. Nearly three-quarters of all strokes occur in people over the age of 65. And the risk of having a stroke more than doubles each decade between the ages of 55 and 85. Stroke occurs in all age groups, in both sexes, and in all races in every country. It can even occur before birth, when the fetus is still in the womb. Learning about stroke can help you act in time to save a relative, neighbor, or friend. And making changes in your lifestyle can help you prevent stroke. What Is Stroke? A stroke is sometimes called a \"brain attack.\" Most often, stroke occurs when blood flow to the brain stops because it is blocked by a clot. When this happens, the brain cells in the immediate area begin to die. Some brain cells die because they stop getting the oxygen and nutrients they need to function. Other brain cells die because they are damaged by sudden bleeding into or around the brain. The brain cells that don\\'t die immediately remain at risk for death. These cells can linger in a compromised or weakened state for several hours. With timely treatment, these cells can be saved. New treatments are available that greatly reduce the damage caused by a stroke. But you need to arrive at the hospital as soon as possible after symptoms start to prevent disability and to greatly improve your chances for recovery. Knowing stroke symptoms, calling 911 immediately, and getting to a hospital as quickly as possible are critical. Ischemic Stroke There are two kinds of stroke. The most common kind of stroke is called ischemic stroke. It accounts for approximately 80 percent of all strokes. An ischemic stroke is caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel supplying blood to the brain. Blockages that cause ischemic strokes stem from three conditions: - the formation of a clot within a blood vessel of the brain or neck, called thrombosis  - the movement of a clot from another part of the body, such as from the heart to the neck or brain, called an embolism  - a severe narrowing of an artery (stenosis) in or leading to the brain, due to fatty deposits lining the blood vessel walls. the formation of a clot within a blood vessel of the brain or neck, called thrombosis the movement of a clot from another part of the body, such as from the heart to the neck or brain, called an embolism a severe narrowing of an artery (stenosis) in or leading to the brain, due to fatty deposits lining the blood vessel walls. Hemorrhagic Stroke The other kind of stroke is called hemorrhagic stroke. A hemorrhagic stroke is caused by a blood vessel that breaks and bleeds into the brain. One common cause of a hemorrhagic stroke is a bleeding aneurysm. An aneurysm is a weak or thin spot on an artery wall. Over time, these weak spots stretch or balloon out due to high blood pressure. The thin walls of these ballooning aneurysms can rupture and spill blood into the space surrounding brain cells. Artery walls can also break open because they become encrusted, or covered with fatty deposits called plaque, eventually lose their elasticity and become brittle, thin, and prone to cracking. Hypertension, or high blood pressure, increases the risk that a brittle artery wall will give way and release blood into the surrounding brain tissue.', 'Know the Signs Knowing the warning signs of stroke and controlling stroke\\'s risk factors can lower your risk of death or disability. If you suffer a stroke, you may not realize it at first. The people around you might not know it, either. Your family, friends, or neighbors may think you are unaware or confused. You may not be able to call 911 on your own. That\\'s why everyone should know the signs of stroke and know how to act fast. Warning signs are clues your body sends to tell you that your brain is not receiving enough oxygen. If you observe one or more of the following signs of a stroke or \"brain attack,\" don\\'t wait. Call 911 right away! Common Signs of Stroke These are warning signs of a stroke: - sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body  - sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding  - sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes  - sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination  - sudden severe headache with no known cause. sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination sudden severe headache with no known cause. Other danger signs that may occur include double vision, drowsiness, and nausea or vomiting. Don\\'t Ignore \"Mini-Strokes\" Sometimes the warning signs of stroke may last only a few moments and then disappear. These brief episodes, known as transient ischemic attacks or TIAs, are sometimes called \"mini-strokes.\" Although brief, TIAs identify an underlying serious condition that isn\\'t going away without medical help. Unfortunately, since they clear up, many people ignore them. Don\\'t ignore them. Heeding them can save your life. Why It\\'s Important To Act Fast Stroke is a medical emergency. Every minute counts when someone is having a stroke. The longer blood flow is cut off to the brain, the greater the damage. Immediate treatment can save peoples lives and enhance their chances for successful recovery. Ischemic strokes, the most common type of strokes, can be treated with a drug called t-PA that dissolves blood clots obstructing blood flow to the brain. The window of opportunity to start treating stroke patients is three hours, but to be evaluated and receive treatment, patients need to get to the hospital within 60 minutes. What Should You Do? Don\\'t wait for the symptoms of stroke to improve or worsen. If you believe you are having a stroke, call 911 immediately. Making the decision to call for medical help can make the difference in avoiding a lifelong disability and in greatly improving your chances for recovery. If you observe someone having a stroke  if he or she suddenly loses the ability to speak, or move an arm or leg on one side, or experiences facial paralysis on one side  call 911 immediately.', \"A risk factor is a condition or behavior that increases your chances of getting a disease. Having a risk factor for stroke doesn't mean you'll have a stroke. On the other hand, not having a risk factor doesn't mean you'll avoid a stroke. But your risk of stroke grows as the number and severity of risk factors increase. These risk factors for stroke cannot be changed by medical treatment or lifestyle changes. - Age. Although stroke risk increases with age, stroke can occur at any age. Recent studies have found that stroke rates among people under 55 grew from 13 percent in 1993-1994, to 19 percent in 2005. Experts speculate the increase may be due to a rise in risk factors such as diabetes, obesity, and high cholesterol. Age. Although stroke risk increases with age, stroke can occur at any age.

For African Americans, stroke is more common and more deadly  even in young and middle-aged adults  than for any ethnic or other racial group in the U.S. Studies show that the age-adjusted incidence of stroke is about twice as high in African Americans and Hispanic Americans as in Caucasians. An important risk factor for African Americans is sickle cell disease, which can cause a narrowing of arteries and disrupt blood flow. Race.

Stroke seems to run in some families. Several factors may contribute to familial stroke. Members of a family might have a genetic tendency for stroke risk factors, such as an inherited predisposition for high blood pressure (hypertension) or diabetes. The influence of a common lifestyle among family members could also contribute to familial stroke. Family history of stroke. Stroke seems to run in some families. Several factors may contribute to familial stroke. Members of a family might have a genetic tendency for stroke risk factors, such as an inherited predisposition for high blood pressure (hypertension) or diabetes. The influence of a common lifestyle among family members could also contribute to familial stroke. Some of the most important risk factors for stroke that CAN be treated are - high blood pressure  - smoking  - heart disease  -  high blood cholesterol  - warning signs or history of a stroke  - diabetes. high blood pressure smoking heart disease high blood cholesterol warning signs or history of a stroke diabetes. High Blood Pressure High blood pressure, also called hypertension, is by far the most potent risk factor for stroke. If your blood pressure is high, you and your doctor need to work out an individual strategy to bring it down to the normal range. Here are some ways to reduce blood pressure: - Maintain proper weight.  - Avoid drugs known to raise blood pressure.  - Cut down on salt.  - Eat fruits and vegetables to increase potassium in your diet.  - Exercise more. Maintain proper weight. Avoid drugs known to raise blood pressure. Cut down on salt. Eat fruits and vegetables to increase potassium in your diet. Exercise more. Your doctor may prescribe medicines that help lower blood pressure. Controlling blood pressure will also help you avoid heart disease, diabetes, and kidney failure. Smoking Cigarette smoking has been linked to the buildup of fatty substances in the carotid artery, the main neck artery supplying blood to the brain. Blockage of this artery is the leading cause of stroke in Americans. Also, nicotine raises blood pressure, carbon monoxide reduces the amount of oxygen your blood can carry to the brain, and cigarette smoke makes your blood thicker and more likely to clot. Your doctor can recommend programs and medications that may help you quit smoking. By quitting -- at any age -- you also reduce your risk of lung disease, heart disease, and a number of cancers including lung cancer. Heart Disease Heart disease, including common heart disorders such as coronary artery disease, valve defects, irregular heart beat, and enlargement of one of the heart's chambers, can result in blood clots that may break loose and block vessels in or leading to the brain. The most common blood vessel disease, caused by the buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries, is called atherosclerosis, also known as hardening of the arteries. Your doctor will treat your heart disease and may also prescribe medication, such as aspirin, to help prevent the formation of clots. Your doctor may recommend surgery to clean out a clogged neck artery if you match a particular risk profile. High Blood Cholesterol A high level of total cholesterol in the blood is a major risk factor for heart disease, which raises your risk of stroke. Your doctor may recommend changes in your diet or medicines to lower your cholesterol. Warning Signs or History of Stroke Experiencing warning signs and having a history of stroke are also risk factors for stroke. Transient ischemic attacks, or TIAs, are brief episodes of stroke warning signs that may last only a few moments and then go away. If you experience a TIA, get help at once. Call 911. If you have had a stroke in the past, it's important to reduce your risk of a second stroke. Your brain helps you recover from a stroke by drawing on body systems that now do double duty. That means a second stroke can be twice as bad. Diabetes Having diabetes is another risk factor for stroke. You may think this disorder affects only the body's ability to use sugar, or glucose. But it also causes destructive changes in the blood vessels throughout the body, including the brain. Also, if blood glucose levels are high at the time of a stroke, then brain damage is usually more severe and extensive than when blood glucose is well-controlled. Treating diabetes can delay the onset of complications that increase the risk of stroke.\", \"Stroke is preventable and treatable. A better understanding of the causes of stroke has helped people make lifestyle changes that have cut the stroke death rate nearly in half in the last two decades. Preventing Stroke While family history of stroke plays a role in your risk, there are many risk factors you can control: - If you have high blood pressure, work with your doctor to get it under control.   - If you smoke,  quit.  - If you have diabetes, learn how to manage it. Many people do not realize they have diabetes, which is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke.  - If you are overweight, start maintaining a healthy diet and exercising regularly.   - If you have high cholesterol, work with your doctor to lower it.

Diagnosing Stroke Physicians have several diagnostic techniques and imaging tools to help diagnose stroke quickly and accurately. The first step in diagnosis is a short neurological examination, or an evaluation of the nervous system. When a possible stroke patient arrives at a hospital, a health care professional, usually a doctor or nurse, will ask the patient or a companion what happened and when the symptoms began. Blood tests, an electrocardiogram, and a brain scan such as computed tomography or CT, or magnetic resonance imaging or MRI, will often be done. Measuring Stroke Severity One test that helps doctors judge the severity of a stroke is the standardized NIH Stroke Scale, developed by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health, or NIH. Health care professionals use the NIH Stroke Scale to measure a patient's neurological deficits by asking the patient to answer questions and to perform several physical and mental tests. Other scales include the Glasgow Coma Scale, the Hunt and Hess Scale, the Modified Rankin Scale, and the Barthel Index. Diagnostic Imaging: CT Scan Health care professionals also use a variety of imaging techniques to evaluate acute stroke patients. The most widely used is computed tomography or CT scan, sometimes pronounced CAT scan, which is comprised of a series of cross-sectional images of the head and brain. CT scans are sensitive for detecting hemorrhage and are therefore useful for differentiating hemorrhagic stroke, caused by bleeding in the brain, from ischemic stroke, caused by a blockage of blood flow to the brain. Hemorrhage is the primary reason for avoiding thrombolytic therapy (drugs that break up or dissolve blood clots), the only proven therapy for acute ischemic stroke. Because thrombolytic therapy might make a hemorrhagic stroke worse, doctors must confirm that the acute symptoms are not due to hemorrhage prior to giving the drug. A CT scan may show evidence of early ischemia  an area of tissue that is dead or dying due to a loss of blood supply. Ischemic strokes generally show up on a CT scan about six to eight hours after the start of stroke symptoms. Though not as common in practice, CT scans also can be performed with a contrast agent to help visualize a blockage in the large arteries supplying the brain, or detect areas of decreased blood flow to the brain. Because CT is readily available at all hours at most major hospitals, produces images quickly, and is good for ruling out hemorrhage prior to starting thrombolytic therapy, CT is the most widely used diagnostic imaging technique for acute stroke. Diagnostic Imaging: MRI Scan Another imaging technique used in acute stroke patients is the magnetic resonance imaging or MRI scan. MRI uses magnetic fields to detect a variety of changes in the brain and blood vessels caused by a stroke. One effect of ischemic stroke is the slowing of water movement through the injured brain tissue. Because MRI can show this type of injury very soon after stroke symptoms start, MRI has proven useful for diagnosing acute ischemic stroke before it is visible on CT. MRI also allows doctors to visualize blockages in the arteries, identify sites of prior stroke, and create a stroke treatment and prevention plan. Differences Between CT and MRI Scans MRI and CT are equally accurate for determining when hemorrhage is present. The benefit of MRI over a CT scan is more accurate and earlier diagnosis of ischemic stroke, especially for smaller strokes and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). MRI can be more sensitive than CT for detecting other types of neurological disorders that mimic the symptoms of stroke. However, MRI cannot be performed in patients with certain types of metallic or electronic implants, such as pacemakers for the heart. Although increasingly used in the emergency diagnosis of stroke, MRI is not immediately available at all hours in most hospitals, where CT is used for acute stroke diagnosis. MRI typically takes longer to perform than CT, and therefore may not be the first choice when minutes count.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283468.390663}
