The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Fetal akinesia syndrome X-linked. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Agenesis of corpus callosum - Arrhinencephaly - Blepharophimosis - Fetal akinesia sequence - Hypokinesia - Polyhydramnios - Stillbirth - Telecanthus - X-linked inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Paroxysmal extreme pain disorder is a form of peripheral neuropathy characterized by skin redness and warmth (flushing) and attacks of severe pain in various parts of the body. Early in life, the pain is often concentrated in the lower part of the body and may be triggered by a bowel movement. As a person ages, the location of the pain may change, with attacks affecting the head and face. Triggers of these pain attacks include changes in temperature, emotional distress or eating spicy foods and drinking cold beverages. Paroxysmal extreme pain disorder is caused by mutations  in the SCN9A gene. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Treatment may include medications used to manage chronic neuropathic pain (anticonvulsants) such as the sodium channel blocker carbamazepine.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Paroxysmal extreme pain disorder?
