During early to mid-adulthood, affected individuals typically begin to experience muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy) in one or both calves. If only one leg is affected, the calves appear different in size (asymmetrical). Calf weakness can make it difficult to stand on tiptoe.  As Miyoshi myopathy slowly progresses, the muscle weakness and atrophy spread up the leg to the muscles in the thigh and buttock. Eventually, affected individuals may have difficulty climbing stairs or walking for an extended period of time. Some people with Miyoshi myopathy may eventually need wheelchair assistance.  Rarely, the upper arm or shoulder muscles are mildly affected in Miyoshi myopathy. In a few cases, abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) have developed. Individuals with Miyoshi myopathy have highly elevated levels of an enzyme called creatine kinase (CK) in their blood, which often indicates muscle disease.', 'The exact prevalence of Miyoshi myopathy is unknown. In Japan, where the condition was first described, it is estimated to affect 1 in 440,000 individuals.']}"}, "time": 1746283449.5075772}
