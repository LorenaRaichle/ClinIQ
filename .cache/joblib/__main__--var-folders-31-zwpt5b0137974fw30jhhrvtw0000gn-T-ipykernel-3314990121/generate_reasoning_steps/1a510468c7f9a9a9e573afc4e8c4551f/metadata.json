People with trigeminal trophic syndrome have a loss of sensation in the nose or abnormal sensations like tingling, numbness, or burning and they rub or scratch the skin causing cuts or ulcers in the area. When the cuts heal, they can cause scars that pull up the lip. Similar cuts may also occur in the corners of the eyes, scalp or inside the mouth. The tip of the nose is spared because its sensation comes from a different nerve. Trigeminal trophic syndrome may occur in people who were treated for trigeminal neuralgia or after leprosy (Hansen's disease) or shingles infection. Treatment options include medications, radiotherapy, and covering the wounds until they have fully healed. Another treatment option is a technique called transcutaneous electrical stimulation that uses a small electronic device to direct mild electric pulses to nerve endings that lie beneath the skin.\", 'What are the signs and symptoms of Pediatric ulcerative colitis? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Pediatric ulcerative colitis. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abdominal pain - Diarrhea - Growth delay - Heterogeneous - Intestinal obstruction - Multifactorial inheritance - Recurrent aphthous stomatitis - Ulcerative colitis - Weight loss - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Mercury poisoning is a condition that occurs in people who are exposed to toxic levels of the element, mercury. There are three different forms of mercury that can cause health problems: Elemental mercury (also known as liquid mercury or quicksilver) can be found in glass thermometers, electrical switches, dental fillings and fluorescent light bulbs. This form of mercury is generally only harmful when small droplets become airborne and are inhaled. If this occurs, signs and symptoms of poisoning may include metallic taste, vomiting, difficulty breathing, coughing, and/or swollen, bleeding gums. In severe cases, long-term brain damage, permanent lung damage and even death may occur. Inorganic mercury is found in batteries, chemistry labs, and some disinfectants. This form of mercury is harmful when swallowed. Signs and symptoms of inorganic mercury poisoning vary based on the amount consumed, but may include burning in the stomach and throat; vomiting; and/or bloody diarrhea. Inorganic mercury can also affect the kidneys and brain if it enters the blood stream. Organic mercury can be found in fish. Some organisms convert fumes from burning coal into organic mercury. This form of mercury is harmful if inhaled, eaten, or placed on the skin for long periods of time. Long-term exposure to organic mercury may result in skin numbness or pain; tremor; inability to walk well; blindness; double vision; memory problems; seizures; or even death. Treatment is generally supportive and based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. Medications called chelators, which remove mercury and heavy metals from the body, are generally prescribed.']}"}, "time": 1746283458.6318479}
