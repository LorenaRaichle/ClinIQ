Pediatricians are doctors who specialize in treating children.\\n                \\nIf the disease has affected your child's coronary (heart) arteries, a pediatric cardiologist will confirm the diagnosis and give ongoing treatment. Pediatric cardiologists treat children who have heart problems.\\n                \\nOther specialists also may be involved in treating children who have Kawasaki disease.\\n                \\nSigns and Symptoms\\n                \\nThe doctor will check your child for the classic signs and symptoms of Kawasaki disease.\\n                \\nThe doctor will rule out other diseases that cause similar symptoms. These diseases include Rocky Mountain spotted fever, scarlet fever, and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.\\n                \\nGenerally, your child will be diagnosed with Kawasaki disease if he or she has a fever that lasts longer than 5 days plus four other classic signs or symptoms of the disease.\\n                \\nHowever, not all children have classic signs and symptoms of Kawasaki disease. Tests and procedures can help confirm whether a child has the disease.\\n                \\nTests and Procedures\\n                \\nEchocardiography\\n                \\nIf the doctor thinks that your child has Kawasaki disease, he or she will likely recommendechocardiography(EK-o-kar-de-OG-ra-fee), or echo. This painless test uses sound waves to create pictures of the heart and coronary arteries.\\n                \\nEcho also can help show the disease's effects over time, if any, on your child's coronary arteries. Often, the disease's effects on the coronary arteries don't show up until the second or third week after the first symptoms appear. Thus, this test is done regularly after the diagnosis.\\n                \\nSome children who have Kawasaki disease don't have the classic signs and symptoms of the acute phase. Doctors may not diagnose these children until 2 to 3 weeks after the onset of the disease. This is when another common sign of Kawasaki disease occurspeeling of the skin on the fingers and toes.\\n                \\nIf your child is diagnosed at this point, he or she will likely need echo right away to see whether the disease has affected the coronary arteries.\\n                \\nOther Diagnostic Tests\\n                \\nDoctors also use other tests to help diagnose Kawasaki disease, such as:\\n                \\nBlood tests. The results from blood tests can show whether the body's blood vessels are inflamed.\\n                \\nChest x ray. This painless test creates pictures of structures inside the chest, such as the heart and lungs. A chest x ray can show whether Kawasaki disease has affected the heart.\\n                \\nEKG (electrocardiogram). This simple test detects and records the heart's electrical activity. An EKG can show whether Kawasaki disease has affected the heart.\", \"Medicines are the main treatment for Kawasaki disease. Rarely, children whose coronary (heart) arteries are affected may need medical procedures or surgery.\\n                \\nThe goals of treatment include:\\n                \\nReducing fever and inflammation to improve symptoms\\n                \\nPreventing the disease from affecting the coronary arteries\\n                \\nInitial Treatment\\n                \\nKawasaki disease can cause serious health problems. Thus, your child will likely be treated in a hospital, at least for the early part of treatment.\\n                \\nThe standard treatment during the disease's acute phase is high-dose aspirin and immune globulin. Immune globulin is a medicine that's injected into a vein.\\n                \\nMost children who receive these treatments improve greatly within 24 hours. For a small number of children, fever remains. These children may need a second round of immune globulin.\\n                \\nAt the start of treatment, your child will receive high doses of aspirin. As soon as his or her fever goes away, a low dose of aspirin is given. The low dose helps prevent blood clots, which can form in the inflamed small arteries.\\n                \\nMost children treated for Kawasaki disease fully recover from the acute phase and don't need any further treatment. They should, however, follow a healthy diet and adopt healthy lifestyle habits. Taking these steps can help lower the risk of future heart disease. (Following a healthy lifestyle is advised for all children, not just those who have Kawasaki disease.)\\n                \\nChildren who have had immune globulin should wait 11 months before having the measles and chicken pox vaccines. Immune globulin can prevent those vaccines from working well.\\n                \\nLong-Term Care and Treatment\\n                \\nIf Kawasaki disease has affected your child's coronary arteries, he or she will need ongoing care and treatment.\\n                \\nIt's best if a pediatric cardiologist provides this care to reduce the risk of severe heart problems. A pediatric cardiologist is a doctor who specializes in treating children who have heart problems.\\n                \\nMedicines and Tests\\n                \\nWhen Kawasaki disease affects the coronary arteries, they may expand and twist. If this happens, your child's doctor may prescribe blood-thinning medicines (for example, warfarin). These medicines help prevent blood clots from forming in the affected coronary arteries.\\n                \\nBlood-thinning medicines usually are stopped after the coronary arteries heal. Healing may occur about 18 months after the acute phase of the disease.\\n                \\nIn a small number of children, the coronary arteries don't heal. These children likely will need routine tests, such as:\\n                \\nEchocardiography. This test uses sound waves to create images of the heart.\\n                \\nEKG (electrocardiogram). This test detects and records the heart's electrical activity.\\n                \\nStress test. This test provides information about how the heart works during physical activity or stress.\\n                \\nMedical Procedures and Surgery\\n                \\nRarely, a child who has Kawasaki disease may needcardiac catheterization(KATH-eh-ter-ih-ZA-shun). Doctors use this procedure to diagnose and treat some heart conditions.\\n                \\nA flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in the arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck and threaded to the heart. Through the catheter, doctors can perform tests and treatments on the heart.\\n                \\nVery rarely, a child may need to have other procedures or surgery if inflammation narrows his or her coronary arteries and blocks blood flow to the heart.\\n                \\nPercutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), stent placement, or coronary artery bypass grafting(CABG) may be used.\\n                \\nCoronary angioplasty restores blood flow through narrowed or blocked coronary arteries. A thin tube with a balloon on the end is inserted into a blood vessel in the arm or groin. The tube is threaded to the narrowed or blocked coronary artery. Then, the balloon is inflated to widen the artery and restore blood flow.\\n                \\nA stent (small mesh tube) may be placed in the coronary artery during angioplasty. This device helps support the narrowed or weakened artery. A stent can improve blood flow and prevent the artery from bursting.\\n                \\nRarely, a child may need to have CABG. This surgery is used to treat blocked coronary arteries. During CABG, a healthy artery or vein from another part of the body is connected, or grafted, to the blocked coronary artery.\\n                \\nThe grafted artery or vein bypasses (that is, goes around) the blocked part of the coronary artery. This improves blood flow to the heart.\", \"Kawasaki disease can't be prevented. However, most children who have the disease recoverusually within weeks of getting signs and symptoms. Further problems are rare.\", 'Hemolytic anemia (HEE-moh-lit-ick uh-NEE-me-uh) is a condition in which red blood cells are destroyed and removed from the bloodstream before their normal lifespan is over.\\n                \\nRed blood cells are disc-shaped and look like doughnuts without holes in the center. These cells carry oxygen to your body. They also remove carbon dioxide (a waste product) from your body.\\n                \\nRed blood cells are made in the bone marrowa sponge-like tissue inside the bones. They live for about 120 days in the bloodstream and then die.\\n                \\nWhite blood cells and platelets (PLATE-lets) also are made in the bone marrow. White blood cells help fight infections. Platelets stick together to seal small cuts or breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding.\\n                \\nWhen blood cells die, the body\\'s bone marrow makes more blood cells to replace them. However, in hemolytic anemia, the bone marrow can\\'t make red blood cells fast enough to meet the body\\'s needs.\\n                \\nHemolytic anemia can lead to many health problems, such as fatigue (tiredness), pain, irregular heartbeats called arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs), an enlarged heart, and heart failure.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nHemolytic anemia is a type of anemia. The term \"anemia\" usually refers to a condition in which the blood has a lower than normal number of red blood cells.\\n                \\nAnemia also can occur if your red blood cells don\\'t contain enough hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin). Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.\\n                \\nAnemia has three main causes: blood loss, lack of red blood cell production, or high rates of red blood cell destruction.\\n                \\nHemolytic anemia is caused by high rates of red blood cell destruction. Many diseases, conditions, and factors can cause the body to destroy its red blood cells.\\n                \\nThese causes can be inherited or acquired. \"Inherited\" means your parents passed the gene(s) for the condition on to you. \"Acquired\" means you aren\\'t born with the condition, but you develop it. Sometimes the cause of hemolytic anemia isn\\'t known.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nThere are many types of hemolytic anemia. Treatment and outlook depend on what type you have and how severe it is. The condition can develop suddenly or slowly. Symptoms can range from mild to severe.\\n                \\nHemolytic anemia often can be successfully treated or controlled. Mild hemolytic anemia may need no treatment at all. Severe hemolytic anemia requires prompt and proper treatment, or it may be fatal.\\n                \\nInherited forms of hemolytic anemia are lifelong conditions that may require ongoing treatment. Acquired forms of hemolytic anemia may go away if the cause of the condition is found and corrected.']}"}, "time": 1746283466.099106}
