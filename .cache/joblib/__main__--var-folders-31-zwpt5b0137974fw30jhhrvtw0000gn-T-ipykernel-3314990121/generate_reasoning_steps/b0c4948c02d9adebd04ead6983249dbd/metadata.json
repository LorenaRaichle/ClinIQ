In some individuals, the pain associated with Tietze syndrome resolves on its own without any treatment. Management options for others may include avoidance of strenuous activity; applying local heat; taking pain medications and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; and receiving local corticosteroid injections. Although the pain usually subsides after several weeks or months, swelling may persist.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Autosomal dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type D? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Autosomal dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type D. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Areflexia - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Axonal degeneration/regeneration - Distal amyotrophy - Distal muscle weakness - Distal sensory impairment - Hyporeflexia - Segmental peripheral demyelination/remyelination - Upper limb muscle weakness - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Alaninuria with microcephaly, dwarfism, enamel hypoplasia and diabetes mellitus?

Patients with this condition are likely to have systemic involvement, including angioedema, arthralgias, pulmonary disease, abdominal or chest pain, fever, renal disease, and episcleritis. Hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis is thought be an autoimmune response involving a specific region of complement 1 (C1). It can present as or precede a syndrome that includes obstructive pulmonary disease , uveitis, systemic lupus erythematous (SLE), Sjgren's syndrome, or cryoglobulinemia (which is closely linked with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus infection). Some cases of hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis respond to therapies commonly used for the treatment of SLE, including low-dose prednisone, hydroxychloroquine, dapsone, or other immunomodulatory agents.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283455.700037}
