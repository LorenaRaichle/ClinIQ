A person having SCA needs to be treated with a defibrillator right away. This device sends an electric shock to the heart. The electric shock can restore a normal rhythm to a heart that\\'s stopped beating.\\n                \\nTo work well, defibrillation must be done within minutes of SCA. With every minute that passes, the chances of surviving SCA drop rapidly.\\n                \\nPolice, emergency medical technicians, and other first responders usually are trained and equipped to use a defibrillator. Call 911 right away if someone has signs or symptoms of SCA. The sooner you call for help, the sooner lifesaving treatment can begin.\\n                \\nAutomated External Defibrillators\\n                \\nAutomated external defibrillators (AEDs) are special defibrillators that untrained bystanders can use. These portable devices often are found in public places, such as shopping malls, golf courses, businesses, airports, airplanes, casinos, convention centers, hotels, sports venues, and schools.\\n                \\nAEDs are programmed to give an electric shock if they detect a dangerous arrhythmia, such as ventricular fibrillation. This prevents giving a shock to someone who may have fainted but isn\\'t having SCA.\\n                \\nYou should give cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to a person having SCA until defibrillation can be done.\\n                \\nPeople who are at risk for SCA may want to consider having an AED at home. A 2008 study by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the National Institutes of Health found that AEDs in the home are safe and effective.\\n                \\nSome people feel that placing these devices in homes will save many lives because many SCAs occur at home.Others note that no evidence supports the idea that home-use AEDs save more lives. These people fear that people who have AEDs in their homes will delay calling for help during an emergency. They\\'re also concerned that people who have home-use AEDs will not properly maintain the devices or forget where they are.\\n                \\nWhen considering a home-use AED, talk with your doctor. He or she can help you decide whether having an AED in your home will benefit you.\\n                \\nTreatment in a Hospital\\n                \\nIf you survive SCA, you\\'ll likely be admitted to a hospital for ongoing care and treatment. In the hospital, your medical team will closely watch your heart. They may give you medicines to try to reduce the risk of another SCA.\\n                \\nWhile in the hospital, your medical team will try to find out what caused your SCA. If you\\'re diagnosed with coronary heart disease, you may havepercutaneous coronary intervention, also known as coronary angioplasty,or coronary artery bypass grafting. These procedures help restore blood flow through narrowed or blocked coronary arteries.\\n                \\nOften, people who have SCA get a device called an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). This small device is surgically placed under the skin in your chest or abdomen. An ICD uses electric pulses or shocks to help control dangerous arrhythmias. (For more information, go to \"How Can Death Due to Sudden Cardiac Arrest Be Prevented?\")', \"Ways to prevent death due to sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) differ depending on whether:\\n                \\nYou've already had SCA\\n                \\nYou've never had SCA but are at high risk for the condition\\n                \\nYou've never had SCA and have no known risk factors for the condition\\n                \\nFor People Who Have Survived Sudden Cardiac Arrest\\n                \\nIf you've already had SCA, you're at high risk of having it again. Research shows that an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) reduces the chances of dying from a second SCA.An ICD is surgically placed under the skin in your chest or abdomen. The device has wires with electrodes on the ends that connect to your heart's chambers. The ICD monitors your heartbeat.\\n                \\nIf the ICD detects a dangerous heart rhythm, it gives an electric shock to restore the heart's normal rhythm. Your doctor may give you medicine to limit irregular heartbeats that can trigger the ICD.\\n                \\nImplantable Cardioverter Defibrillator\\n                \\n\\n                \\nAn ICD isn't the same as a pacemaker. The devices are similar, but they have some differences. Pacemakers give off low-energy electrical pulses. They're often used to treat less dangerous heart rhythms, such as those that occur in the upper chambers of the heart. Most new ICDs work as both pacemakers and ICDs.\\n                \\nFor People at High Risk for a First Sudden Cardiac Arrest\\n                \\nIf you have severe coronary heart disease (CHD), you're at increased risk for SCA. This is especially true if you've recently had a heart attack.\\n                \\nYour doctor may prescribe a type of medicine called a beta blocker to help lower your risk for SCA. Your doctor also may discuss beginning statin treatment if you have an elevated risk for developing heart disease or having a stroke. Doctors usually prescribe statins for people who have:\\n                \\nDiabetes\\n                \\nHeart disease or had a prior stroke\\n                \\nHigh LDL cholesterol levels\\n                \\nYour doctor also may prescribe other medications to:\\n                \\nDecrease your chance of having a heart attack or dying suddenly.\\n                \\nLower blood pressure.\\n                \\nPrevent blood clots, which can lead to heart attack or stroke.\\n                \\nPrevent or delay the need for a procedure or surgery, such as angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting.\\n                \\nReduce your hearts workload and relieve coronary heart disease symptoms.\\n                \\nTake all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to. You should still follow a heart-healthy lifestyle, even if you take medicines to treat your coronary heart disease.\\n                \\nOther treatments for coronary heart diseasesuch as percutaneous coronary intervention, also known as coronary angioplasty, or coronary artery bypass graftingalso may lower your risk for SCA. Your doctor also may recommend an ICD if youre at high risk for SCA.\\n                \\nFor People Who Have No Known Risk Factors for Sudden Cardiac Arrest\\n                \\nCHD seems to be the cause of most SCAs in adults. CHD also is a major risk factor for angina (chest pain or discomfort) and heart attack, and it contributes to other heart problems.\\n                \\nFollowing a healthy lifestyle can help you lower your risk for CHD, SCA, and other heart problems. A heart-healthy lifestyle includes:\\n                \\nHeart-healthy eating\\n                \\nMaintaining a healthy weight\\n                \\nManaging stress\\n                \\nPhysical activity\\n                \\nQuitting smoking\\n                \\nHeart-Healthy Eating\\n                \\nHeart-healthy eating is an important part of a heart-healthy lifestyle. Your doctor may recommend heart-healthy eating, which should include:\\n                \\nFat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk\\n                \\nFish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week\\n                \\nFruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes\\n                \\nLegumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans\\n                \\nVegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots\\n                \\nWhole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas\\n                \\nWhen following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating:\\n                \\nA lot of red meat\\n                \\nPalm and coconut oils\\n                \\nSugary foods and beverages\\n                \\nTwo nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise:\\n                \\nSaturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals\\n                \\nTrans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats and meats.\\n                \\nSaturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5percent to 6percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples:\\n                \\nIf you eat:\\n                \\nTry to eat no more than:\\n                \\n1,200 calories a day              \\n                \\n8 grams of saturated fat a day    \\n                \\n1,500 calories a day           \\n                \\n10 grams of saturated fat a day\\n                \\n1,800 calories a day           \\n                \\n12 grams of saturated fat a day\\n                \\n2,000 calories a day           \\n                \\n13 grams of saturated fat a day\\n                \\n2,500 calories a day           \\n                \\n17 grams of saturated fat a day\\n                \\nNot all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterol levels. Some sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are:\\n                \\nAvocados\\n                \\nCorn, sunflower, and soybean oils\\n                \\nNuts and seeds, such as walnuts\\n                \\nOlive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils\\n                \\nPeanut butter\\n                \\nSalmon and trout\\n                \\nTofu\\n                \\nSodium\\n                \\nYou should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.\\n                \\nDietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension\\n                \\nYour doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt.\\n                \\nThe DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH.\\n                \\nLimiting Alcohol\\n                \\nTry to limit alcohol intake. Too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain.\\n                \\nMen should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is:\\n                \\n12 ounces of beer\\n                \\n5 ounces of wine\\n                \\n1 ounces of liquor\\n                \\nMaintaining a Healthy Weight\\n                \\nMaintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for sudden cardiac arrest. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active.\\n                \\nKnowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI:\\n                \\nBelow 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.\\n                \\nBetween 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range\\n                \\nBetween 25.0 and 29.9 is considered overweight\\n                \\nOf 30.0 or higher is considered obese\\n                \\nA general goal to aim for is a BMI of less than 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal.\\n                \\nMeasuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type2 diabetes. This risk may be higher with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk.\\n                \\nIf youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3percent to 5percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol.\\n                \\nManaging Stress\\n                \\nManaging and coping with stress. Learning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as:\\n                \\nA stress management program\\n                \\nMeditation\\n                \\nPhysical activity\\n                \\nRelaxation therapy\\n                \\nTalking things out with friends or family\\n                \\nPhysical Activity\\n                \\nRegular physical activity can lower your risk for coronary heart disease, sudden cardiac arrest, and other health problems. Everyone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1hour and 15minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10minutes at a time spread throughout the week.\\n                \\nTalk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.\\n                \\nRead more about physical activity at:\\n                \\nPhysical Activity and Your Heart\\n                \\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans\\n                \\nQuitting Smoking\\n                \\nPeople who smoke are more likely to have a heart attack than are people who dont smoke. The risk of having a heart attack increases with the number of cigarettes smoked each day. Smoking also raises your risk for stroke and lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer.\\n                \\nQuitting smoking can greatly reduce your risk for heart and lung diseases. Ask your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking. Read more about how to quit smoking.\", 'Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare blood disorder. In TTP, blood clots form in small blood vessels throughout the body.\\n                \\nThe clots can limit or block the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the body\\'s organs, such as the brain, kidneys, and heart. As a result, serious health problems can develop.\\n                \\nThe increased clotting that occurs in TTP also uses up platelets (PLATE-lets) in the blood. Platelets are blood cell fragments that help form blood clots. These cell fragments stick together to seal small cuts and breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding.\\n                \\nWith fewer platelets available in the blood, bleeding problems can occur. People who have TTP may bleed inside their bodies, underneath the skin, or from the surface of the skin. When cut or injured, they also may bleed longer than normal.\\n                \\n\"Thrombotic\" (throm-BOT-ik) refers to the blood clots that form. \"Thrombocytopenic\" (throm-bo-cy-toe-PEE-nick) means the blood has a lower than normal number of platelets. \"Purpura\" (PURR-purr-ah) refers to purple bruises caused by bleeding under the skin.\\n                \\nBleeding under the skin also can cause tiny red or purple dots on the skin. These pinpoint-sized dots are called petechiae (peh-TEE-kee-ay). Petechiae may look like a rash.\\n                \\nPurpura and Petechiae\\n                \\n\\n                \\nTTP also can cause red blood cells to break apart faster than the body can replace them. This leads to hemolytic anemia (HEE-moh-lit-ick uh-NEE-me-uh)a rare form of anemia. Anemia is a condition in which the body has a lower than normal number of red blood cells.\\n                \\nA lack of activity in the ADAMTS13 enzyme (a type of protein in the blood) causes TTP. The ADAMTS13 gene controls the enzyme, which is involved in blood clotting. The enzyme breaks up a large protein called von Willebrand factor that clumps together with platelets to form blood clots.\\n                \\nTypes of Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura\\n                \\nThe two main types of TTP are inherited and acquired. \"Inherited\" means the condition is passed from parents to children through genes. This type of TTP mainly affects newborns and children.\\n                \\nIn inherited TTP, the ADAMTS13 gene is faulty and doesn\\'t prompt the body to make a normal ADAMTS13 enzyme. As a result, enzyme activity is lacking or changed.\\n                \\nAcquired TTP is the more common type of the disorder. \"Acquired\" means you aren\\'t born with the disorder, but you develop it. This type of TTP mostly occurs in adults, but it can affect children.\\n                \\nIn acquired TTP, the ADAMTS13 gene isn\\'t faulty. Instead, the body makes antibodies (proteins) that block the activity of the ADAMTS13 enzyme.\\n                \\nIt\\'s not clear what triggers inherited and acquired TTP, but some factors may play a role. These factors may include:\\n                \\nSome diseases and conditions, such as pregnancy, cancer, HIV, lupus, and infections\\n                \\nSome medical procedures, such as surgery and blood and marrow stem cell transplant\\n                \\nSome medicines, such as chemotherapy, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, cyclosporine A, and hormone therapy and estrogens\\n                \\nQuinine, which is a substance often found in tonic water and nutritional health products\\n                \\nIf you have TTP, you may sometimes hear it referred to as TTPHUS. HUS, or hemolytic-uremic syndrome, is a disorder that resembles TTP, but is more common in children. Kidney problems also tend to be worse in HUS. Although some researchers think TTP and HUS are two forms of a single syndrome, recent evidence suggests that each has different causes.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nTTP is a rare disorder. It can be fatal or cause lasting damage, such as brain damage or a stroke, if it\\'s not treated right away.\\n                \\nTTP usually occurs suddenly and lasts for days or weeks, but it can continue for months. Relapses (or flareups) can occur in up to 60 percent of people who have the acquired type of TTP. Many people who have inherited TTP have frequent flareups that need to be treated.\\n                \\nTreatments for TTP include infusions of fresh frozen plasma and plasma exchange, also called plasmapheresis (PLAZ-ma-feh-RE-sis).
