Having a previous occurrence of skin cancer or a close family member with the disease also puts you at risk for skin cancer. Other risk factors include having - a weak immune system  - unusual moles or a large number of moles  - white or light (fair)-colored skin, especially with freckles  - blond or red hair or blue or green eyes  - scars or burns on the skin, or skin diseases that make someone sensitive to the sun. a weak immune system unusual moles or a large number of moles white or light (fair)-colored skin, especially with freckles blond or red hair or blue or green eyes scars or burns on the skin, or skin diseases that make someone sensitive to the sun. In 2008 the National Cancer Institute developed a Melanoma Risk Tool which can help patients and their doctors determine their risk. The tool can be found at  http://www.cancer.gov/melanomarisktool/.', \"The best way to reduce your skin cancer risk is to reduce your exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun. To do this, you can avoid outdoor activities during midday, when the sun's rays are strongest, or wear protective clothing, such as a wide-brimmed hat, long-sleeved shirt, and pants. (Watch the video to learn more about how to protect your skin. To enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. To reduce the video, press the Escape (Esc) button on your keyboard.) Darker-colored clothing is more protective against the sun. A white t-shirt, for example, provides little resistance to ultraviolet (UV) rays, particularly if it gets wet. In addition, wearing sunglasses that wrap around the face or have large frames is a good way to shield the delicate skin around the eyes. When going outside, you should always wear sunscreen and lipscreen. Your sunscreen should have an SPF of at least 15. UV radiation can also come from sunlamps, tanning beds, or tanning booths. UV radiation is present even in cold weather or on a cloudy day. A person's risk of cancer is related to lifetime exposure to UV radiation.\", 'SPF is a sun protection rating. The SPF of a sunscreen is a measure of the time it takes to produce a sunburn in a person wearing sunscreen compared to the time it takes to produce a sunburn in a person not wearing sunscreen. This varies from person to person, so be sure to reapply sunscreen every 2-3 hours.', 'Skin cancer is usually visible. Changes in your skin, such as lumps, scabs, red spots, rough patches, or new or irregular moles should be reported to your doctor. You should also see a doctor if you have a mole, birthmark, or other pigmented area of skin that can be classified by the ABCDE symptom system. ABCDE stands for Melanoma skin cancer is more difficult to treat, so it is important to check for signs and seek treatment as soon as possible. Use the following ABCDE rule to remember the symptoms of melanoma. See a doctor if you have a mole, birthmark, or other pigmented area of skin with  A = Asymmetry. One half of the mole looks different than the other half. (top left image)  B = Border. The edges are often ragged, notched, or blurred in outline. The pigment may spread into the surrounding skin. (top right image)  C = Color. The mole is more than one color. Shades of black, brown, and tan may be present. Areas of white, gray, red, pink, or blue may also be seen.(bottom left image)   D = Diameter.There is a change in size, usually an increase. Melanomas can be tiny, but most are larger than the size of a pea (larger than 6 millimeters or about 1/4 inch). (bottom right image)   E = Evolving. The mole has changed over the past few weeks or months. Other symptoms of skin cancer include a bleeding mole or the appearance of more moles around the first one.']}"}, "time": 1746283468.230619}
