This way, they can learn whether they carry a gene (i.e., have the trait) for an abnormal hemoglobin that they could pass on to a child.\\n                \\nWhen each parent has this information, he or she can be better informed about the chances of having a child with some type of sickle cell disease (SCD), such as hemoglobin SS, SC, S thalassemia, or others.\\n                \\nNewborn Screening\\n                \\nWhen a child has SCD, it is very important to diagnose it early to better prevent complications.\\n                \\nEvery state in the United States, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories require that every baby is tested for SCD as part of a newborn screening program.\\n                \\nIn newborn screening programs, blood from a heel prick is collected in spots on a special paper. The hemoglobin from this blood is then analyzed in special labs.\\n                \\nNewborn screening results are sent to the doctor who ordered the test and to the childs primary doctor.\\n                \\nIf a baby is found to have SCD, health providers from a special follow-up newborn screening group contact the family directly to make sure that the parents know the results. The child is always retested to be sure that the diagnosis is correct.\\n                \\nNewborn screening programs also find out whether the baby has an abnormal hemoglobin trait. If so, parents are informed, and counseling is offered.\\n                \\nRemember that when a child has sickle cell trait or SCD, a future sibling, or the childs own future child, may be at risk. These possibilities should be discussed with the primary care doctor, a blood specialist called a hematologist, and/or a genetics counselor.\\n                \\nPrenatal Screening\\n                \\nDoctors can also diagnose SCD before a baby is born. This is done using a sample of amniotic fluid, the liquid in the sac surrounding a growing embryo, or tissue taken from the placenta, the organ that attaches the umbilical cord to the mothers womb.\\n                \\nTesting before birth can be done as early as 810 weeks into the pregnancy. This testing looks for the sickle hemoglobin gene rather than the abnormal hemoglobin.', 'Health Maintenance To Prevent Complications\\n                \\nBabies with sickle cell disease (SCD) should be referred to a doctor or provider group that has experience taking care of people with this disease. The doctor might be a hematologist (a doctor with special training in blood diseases) or an experienced general pediatrician, internist, or family practitioner.\\n                \\nFor infants, the first SCD visit should take place before 8 weeks of age.\\n                \\nIf someone was born in a country that doesnt perform newborn SCD screening, he or she might be diagnosed with SCD later in childhood. These people should also be referred as soon as possible for special SCD care.\\n                \\n\\n                \\n\\n                \\nExamining the person\\n                \\nGiving medicines and immunizations\\n                \\nPerforming tests\\n                \\nEducating families about the disease and what to watch out for\\n                \\n\\n                \\nPreventing Infection\\n                \\nIn SCD, the spleen doesnt work properly or doesnt work at all. This problem makes people with SCD more likely to get severe infections.\\n                \\nPenicillin\\n                \\nIn children with SCD, taking penicillin two times a day has been shown to reduce the chance of having a severe infection caused by the pneumococcus bacteria. Infants need to take liquid penicillin. Older children can take tablets.\\n                \\nMany doctors will stop prescribing penicillin after a child has reached the age of 5. Some prefer to continue this antibiotic throughout life, particularly if a person has hemoglobin SS or hemoglobin S0 thalassemia, since people with SCD are still at risk. All people who have had surgical removal of the spleen, called a splenectomy, or a past infection with pneumococcus should keep taking penicillin throughout life.\\n                \\nImmunizations\\n                \\nPeople with SCD should receive all recommended childhood vaccines. They should also receive additional vaccines to prevent other infections.\\n                \\nPneumococcus. Even though all children routinely receive the vaccine against pneumococcus (PCV13), children with SCD should also receive a second kind of vaccine against pneumococcus (PPSV23). This second vaccine is given after 24 months of age and again 5 years later. Adults with SCD who have not received any pneumococcal vaccine should get a dose of the PCV13 vaccine. They should later receive the PPSV23 if they have not already received it or it has been more than 5 years since they did. A person should follow these guidelines even if he or she is still taking penicillin.\\n                \\nInfluenza. All people with SCD should receive an influenza shot every year at the start of flu season. This should begin at 6 months of age. Only the inactivated vaccine, which comes as a shot, should be used in people with SCD.\\n                \\nMeningococcus. A child with SCD should receive this vaccine (Menactra or Menveo) at 2, 4, 6, and 1215 months of age. The child should receive a booster vaccine 3 years after this series of shots, then every 5 years after that.\\n                \\nScreening Tests and Evaluations\\n                \\nHeight, Weight, Blood Pressure, and Oxygen Saturation\\n                \\nDoctors will monitor height and weight to be sure that a child is growing properly and that a person with SCD is maintaining a healthy weight.\\n                \\nDoctors will also track a persons blood pressure. When a person with SCD has high blood pressure, it needs to be treated promptly because it can increase the risk of stroke.\\n                \\nOxygen saturation testing provides information about how much oxygen the blood is carrying.\\n                \\nBlood and Urine Testing\\n                \\nPeople with SCD need to have frequent lab tests.\\n                \\nBlood tests help to establish a persons baseline for problems like anemia. Blood testing also helps to show whether a person has organ damage, so that it can be treated early.\\n                \\nUrine testing can help to detect early kidney problems or infections.\\n                \\nTranscranial Doppler (TCD) Ultrasound Screening\\n                \\nChildren who have hemoglobin SS or hemoglobin S0 thalassemia and are between the ages of 2 and 16 should have TCD testing once a year.\\n                \\nThis study can find out whether a child is at higher risk for stroke. When the test is abnormal, regular blood transfusions can decrease the chances of having a stroke.\\n                \\nThe child is awake during the TCD exam. The test does not hurt at all. The TCD machine uses sound waves to measure blood flow like the ultrasound machine used to examine pregnant women.\\n                \\nEye Examinations\\n                \\nAn eye doctor, or ophthalmologist, should examine a persons eyes every 12 years from the age of 10 onwards.\\n                \\nThese exams can detect if there are SCD-related problems of the eye. Regular exams can help doctors find and treat problems early to prevent loss of vision. A person should see his or her doctor right away for any sudden change in vision.\\n                \\nPulmonary Hypertension\\n                \\nDoctors have different approaches to screening for pulmonary hypertension. This is because studies have not given clear information as to when and how a person should receive the screening. People with SCD and their caretakers should discuss with their doctor whether screening makes sense for them.\\n                \\nCognitive Screening\\n                \\nPeople with sickle cell disease can develop cognitive (thinking) problems that may be hard to notice early in life.\\n                \\nSometimes these problems are caused by silent strokes that can only be seen with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain.\\n                \\nPeople with SCD should tell their doctors or nurses if they have thinking problems, such as difficulties learning in school, slowed decision making, or trouble organizing their thoughts.\\n                \\nPeople can be referred for cognitive testing. This testing can identify areas in which a person could use extra help.\\n                \\nChildren with SCD who have thinking problems may qualify for an Individualized Education Program, or IEP. An IEP is a plan that helps students to reach their educational goals. Adults may be able to enroll in vocational rehabilitation programs that can help them with job training.\\n                \\nEducation and Guidance\\n                \\nDoctors and other providers will talk with people who have SCD and their caretakers about complications and also review information at every visit.\\n                \\nBecause there are a lot of things to discuss, new topics are often introduced as a child or adult reaches an age when that subject is important to know about.\\n                \\nDoctors and nurses know that there is a lot of information to learn, and they dont expect people to know everything after one discussion. People with SCD and their families should not be afraid to ask questions.\\n                \\nTopics that are usually covered include:\\n                \\nHours that medical staff are available and contact information to use when people with SCD or caretakers have questions\\n                \\nA plan for what to do and where to get care if a person has a fever, pain, or other signs of SCD complications that need immediate attention\\n                \\nHow SCD is inherited and the risk of having a child with SCD\\n                \\nThe importance of regular medical visits, screening tests, and evaluations\\n                \\nHow to recognize and manage pain\\n                \\nHow to palpate (feel) a childs spleen. Because of the risk of splenic sequestration crisis, caretakers should learn how to palpate a childs spleen. They should try to feel for the spleen daily and more frequently when the child is ill. If they feel that the spleen is bigger than usual, they should call the care provider. \\n                \\nTransitioning Care\\n                \\nWhen children with SCD become adolescents or young adults, they often need to transition from a pediatric care team to an adult care team. This period has been shown to be associated with increased hospital admissions and medical problems. There seem to be many reasons for this.\\n                \\nSome of the increased risk is directly related to the disease. As people with SCD get older, they often develop more organ damage and more disabilities.\\n                \\nThe shift in care usually occurs at the same time that adolescents are undergoing many changes in their emotional, social, and academic lives. The transition to more independent self-management may be difficult, and following treatment plans may become less likely.\\n                \\nWhen compared with pediatrics, there are often fewer adult SCD programs available in a given region. This makes it more difficult for a person with SCD to find appropriate doctors, particularly those with whom they feel comfortable.\\n                \\nTo improve use of regular medical care by people with SCD and to reduce age-related complications, many SCD teams have developed special programs that the make transition easier. Such programs should involve the pediatric and the adult care teams. They should also start early and continue over several years.\\n                \\nManaging Some Complications of SCD\\n                \\nAcute Pain\\n                \\nEach person with SCD should have a home treatment regimen that is best suited to their needs. The providers on the SCD team usually help a person develop a written, tailored care plan. If possible, the person with SCD should carry this plan with them when they go to the emergency room.\\n                \\nWhen an acute crisis is just starting, most doctors will advise the person to drink lots of fluids and to take a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) pain medication, such as ibuprofen. When a person has kidney problems, acetaminophen is often preferred.\\n                \\nIf pain persists, many people will find that they need a stronger medicine.\\n                \\nCombining additional interventions, such as massage, relaxation methods, or a heating pad, may also help.\\n                \\nIf a person with SCD cannot control the pain at home, he or she should go to an SCD day hospital/outpatient unit or an emergency room to receive additional, stronger medicines and intravenous (IV) fluids.\\n                \\nSome people may be able to return home once their pain is under better control. In this case, the doctor may prescribe additional pain medicines for a short course of therapy.\\n                \\nPeople often need to be admitted to the hospital to fully control an acute pain crisis.\\n                \\nWhen taken daily, hydroxyurea has been found to decrease the number and severity of pain episodes.\\n                \\nChronic Pain\\n                \\nSometimes chronic pain results from a complication, such as a leg ulcer or aseptic necrosis of the hip. In this case, doctors try to treat the complication causing the pain.\\n                \\nWhile chronic pain is common in adults with SCD, the cause is often poorly understood. Taking pain medicines daily may help to decrease the pain. Some examples of these medicines include:\\n                \\nNSAID drugs, such as ibuprofen\\n                \\nDuloxetine\\n                \\nGabapentin\\n                \\nAmitriptyline\\n                \\nStrong pain medicines, such as opiates\\n                \\nOther approaches, such as massage, heat, or acupuncture may be helpful in some cases. Chronic pain often comes with feelings of depression and anxiety. Supportive counseling and, sometimes, antidepressant medicines may help. (See coping and emotional issues.)\\n                \\nSevere Anemia\\n                \\nPeople should see their doctors or go to a hospital right away if they develop anemia symptoms from a splenic sequestration crisis or an aplastic crisis. These conditions can be life-threatening, and the person will need careful monitoring and treatment in the hospital. A person also usually needs a blood transfusion.\\n                \\nPeople with SCD and symptoms of severe anemia from other causes should also see a doctor right away.\\n                \\nInfections\\n                \\nFever is a medical emergency in SCD. All caretakers of infants and children with SCD should take their child to their doctor or go to a hospital right away when their child has a fever. Adults with SCD should also seek care for fever or other signs of infection.\\n                \\nAll children and adults who have SCD and a fever (over 38.50 C or 101.30 F) must be seen by a doctor and treated with antibiotics right away.\\n                \\nSome people will need to be hospitalized, while others may receive care and follow-up as an outpatient.\\n                \\nAcute Chest Syndrome\\n                \\nPeople with SCD and symptoms of acute chest syndrome should see their doctor or go to a hospital right away.\\n                \\nThey will need to be admitted to the hospital where they should receive antibiotics and close monitoring. They may need oxygen therapy and a blood transfusion.\\n                \\nWhen taken daily, the medicine hydroxyurea has been found to decrease the number and severity of acute chest events.\\n                \\nClinical Stroke\\n                \\nPeople with SCD who have symptoms of stroke should be brought to the hospital right away by an ambulance. If a person is having symptoms of stroke, someone should call 9-1-1.\\n                \\nSymptoms of stroke may include:\\n                \\nWeakness of an arm or leg on one side of the body\\n                \\nTrouble speaking, walking, or understanding\\n                \\nLoss of balance\\n                \\nSevere headache\\n                \\nIf imaging studies reveal that the person has had an acute stroke, he or she may need an exchange transfusion. This procedure involves slowly removing an amount of the persons blood and replacing it with blood from a donor who does not have SCD or sickle cell trait. Afterward, the person may need to receive monthly transfusions or other treatments to help to prevent another stroke.\\n                \\nSilent Stroke and Cognitive Problems\\n                \\nChildren and adults with SCD and cognitive problems may be able to get useful help based upon the results of their testing. For instance, children may qualify for an IEP. Adults may be able to enroll in vocational, or job, training programs.\\n                \\nPriapism\\n                \\nSometimes, a person may be able to relieve priapism by:\\n                \\nEmptying the bladder by urinating\\n                \\nTaking medicine\\n                \\nIncreasing fluid intake\\n                \\nDoing light exercise\\n                \\nIf a person has an episode that lasts for 4 hours or more, he should go to the hospital to see a hematologist and urologist.\\n                \\nPregnancy\\n                \\nPregnant women with SCD are at greater risk for problems. They should always see an obstetrician, or OB, who has experience with SCD and high-risk pregnancies and deliveries.\\n                \\nThe obstetrician should work with a hematologist or primary medical doctor who is well informed about SCD and its complications.\\n                \\nPregnant women with SCD need more frequent medical visits so that their doctors can follow them closely. The doctor may prescribe certain vitamins and will be careful to prescribe pain medicines that are safe for the baby.\\n                \\nA pregnant woman with SCD may need to have one or more blood transfusions during her pregnancy to treat complications, such as worsening anemia or an increased number of pain or acute chest syndrome events.\\n                \\nHydroxyurea\\n                \\nWhat Is Hydroxyurea?\\n                \\nHydroxyurea is an oral medicine that has been shown to reduce or prevent several SCD complications.\\n                \\nThis medicine was studied in patients with SCD because it was known to increase the amount of fetal hemoglobin (hemoglobin F) in the blood. Increased hemoglobin F provides some protection against the effects of hemoglobin S.\\n                \\nHydroxyurea was later found to have several other benefits for a person with SCD, such as decreasing inflammation.\\n                \\nUse in adults. Many studies of adults with hemoglobin SS or hemoglobin S thalassemia showed that hydroxyurea reduced the number of episodes of pain crises and acute chest syndrome. It also improved anemia and decreased the need for transfusions and hospital admissions.\\n                \\nUse in children. Studies in children with severe hemoglobin SS or S thalassemia showed that hydroxyurea reduced the number of vaso-occlusive crises and hospitalizations. A study of very young children (between the ages of 9 and 18 months) with hemoglobin SS or hemoglobin S thalassemia also showed that hydroxyurea decreased the number of episodes of pain and dactylitis.\\n                \\nWho Should Use Hydroxyurea?\\n                \\nSince hydroxyurea can decrease several complications of SCD, most experts recommend that children and adults with hemoglobin SS or S0 thalassemia who have frequent painful episodes, recurrent chest crises, or severe anemia take hydroxyurea daily.\\n                \\nSome experts offer hydroxyurea to all infants over 9 months of age and young children with hemoglobin SS or S0 thalassemia, even if they do not have severe clinical problems, to prevent or reduce the chance of complications. There is no information about how safe or effective hydroxyurea is in children under 9 months of age.\\n                \\nSome experts will prescribe hydroxyurea to people with other types of SCD who have severe, recurrent pain. There is little information available about how effective hydroxyurea is for these types of SCD.\\n                \\nIn all situations, people with SCD should discuss with their doctors whether or not hydroxyurea is an appropriate medication for them.\\n                \\nPregnant women should not use hydroxyurea.\\n                \\nHow Is Hydroxyurea Taken?\\n                \\nTo work properly, hydroxyurea should be taken by mouth daily at the prescribed dose. When a person does not take it regularly, it will not work as well, or it wont work at all.\\n                \\nA person with SCD who is taking hydroxyurea needs careful monitoring. This is particularly true in the early weeks of taking the medicine. Monitoring includes regular blood testing and dose adjustments.\\n                \\nWhat Are the Risks of Hydroxyurea?\\n                \\nHydroxyurea can cause the bloods white cell count or platelet count to drop. In rare cases, it can worsen anemia. These side effects usually go away quickly if a person stops taking the medication. When a person restarts it, a doctor usually prescribes a lower dose.\\n                \\nOther short-term side effects are less common.\\n                \\nIt is still unclear whether hydroxyurea can cause problems later in life in people with SCD who take it for many years. Studies so far suggest that it does not put people at a higher risk of cancer and does not affect growth in children. But further studies are needed.\\n                \\nRed Blood Cell Transfusions\\n                \\nDoctors may use acute and chronic red blood cell transfusions to treat and prevent certain SCD complications. The red blood cells in a transfusion have normal hemoglobin in them.\\n                \\nA transfusion helps to raise the number of red blood cells and provides normal red blood cells that are more flexible than red blood cells with sickle hemoglobin. These cells live longer in the circulation. Red blood cell transfusions decrease vaso-occlusion (blockage in the blood vessel) and improve oxygen delivery to the tissues and organs.\\n                \\nAcute Transfusion in SCD\\n                \\nDoctors use blood transfusions in SCD for complications that cause severe anemia. They may also use them when a person has an acute stroke, in many cases of acute chest crises, and in multi-organ failure.\\n                \\nA person with SCD usually receives blood transfusions before surgery to prevent SCD-related complications afterwards.\\n                \\nChronic Transfusion\\n                \\nDoctors recommend regular or ongoing blood transfusions for people who have had an acute stroke, since transfusions decrease the chances of having another stroke.\\n                \\nDoctors also recommend chronic blood transfusions for children who have abnormal TCD ultrasound results because transfusions can reduce the chance of having a first stroke.\\n                \\nSome doctors use this approach to treat complications that do not improve with hydroxyurea. They may also use transfusions in people who have too many side effects from hydroxyurea.\\n                \\nWhat Are the Risks of Transfusion Therapy?\\n                \\nPossible complications include:\\n                \\nHemolysis\\n                \\nIron overload, particularly in people receiving chronic transfusions (can severely impair heart and lung function)\\n                \\nInfection\\n                \\nAlloimmunization (can make it hard to find a matching unit of blood for a future transfusion)\\n                \\nAll blood banks and hospital personnel have adopted practices to reduce the risk of transfusion problems.\\n                \\nPeople with SCD who receive transfusions should be monitored for and immunized against hepatitis. They should also receive regular screenings for iron overload. If a person has iron overload, the doctor will give chelation therapy, a medicine to reduce the amount of iron in the body and the problems that iron overload causes.\\n                \\n\\n                \\nHematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation\\n                \\nAt the present time, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only cure for SCD. People with SCD and their families should ask their doctor about this procedure.\\n                \\nWhat Are Stem Cells?\\n                \\nStem cells are special cells that can divide over and over again. After they divide, these cells can go on to become blood red cells, white cells, or platelets.\\n                \\nA person with SCD has stem cells that make red blood cells that can sickle. People without SCD have stem cells that make red cells that usually wont sickle.\\n                \\nWhat Stem Cells Are Used in HSCT?\\n                \\nIn HSCT, stem cells are taken from the bone marrow or blood of a person who does not have sickle cell disease (the donor). The donor, however, may have sickle cell trait.\\n                \\nThe donor is often the persons sister or brother. This is because the safest and most successful transplants use stem cells that are matched for special proteins called HLA antigens. Since these antigens are inherited from parents, a sister or brother is the most likely person to have the same antigens as the person with SCD.\\n                \\nWhat Happens During HSCT?\\n                \\nFirst, stem cells are taken from the donor. After this, the person with SCD (the recipient) is treated with drugs that destroy or reduce his or her own bone marrow stem cells.\\n                \\nThe donor stem cells are then injected into the persons vein. The injected cells will make a home in the recipients bone marrow, gradually replacing the recipients cells. The new stem cells will make red cells that do not sickle.\\n                \\nWhich People Receive HSCT?\\n                \\nAt the present time, most SCD transplants are performed in children who have had complications such as strokes, acute chest crises, and recurring pain crises. These transplants usually use a matched donor.\\n                \\nBecause only about 1 in 10 children with SCD has a matched donor without SCD in their families, the number of people with SCD who get transplants is low.\\n                \\nHSCT is more risky in adults, and that is why most transplants are done in children.\\n                \\nThere are several medical centers that are researching new SCD HSCT techniques in children and adults who dont have a matched donor in the family or are older than most recipients. Hopefully, more people with SCD will be able to receive a transplant in the future, using these new methods.\\n                \\nWhat Are the Risks?\\n                \\nHSCT is successful in about 85 percent of children when the donor is related and HLA matched. Even with this high success rate, HSCT still has risks.\\n                \\nComplications can include severe infections, seizures, and other clinical problems. About 5 percent of people have died. Sometimes transplanted cells attack the recipients organs (graft versus host disease).\\n                \\nMedicines are given to prevent many of the complications, but they still can happen.', 'People who do not know whether they carry an abnormal hemoglobin gene can ask their doctor to have their blood tested.\\n                \\nCouples who are planning to have children and know that they are at risk of having a child with sickle cell disease (SCD) may want to meet with a genetics counselor. A genetics counselor can answer questions about the risk and explain the choices that are available.', 'Hypotension (HI-po-TEN-shun) is abnormally low blood pressure. Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries as the heart pumps out blood.\\n                \\nBlood pressure is measured as systolic (sis-TOL-ik) and diastolic (di-a-STOL-ik) pressures. \"Systolic\" refers to blood pressure when the heart beats while pumping blood. \"Diastolic\" refers to blood pressure when the heart is at rest between beats.\\n                \\nYou most often will see blood pressure numbers written with the systolic number above or before the diastolic number, such as 120/80 mmHg. (The mmHg is millimeters of mercurythe units used to measure blood pressure.)\\n                \\nNormal blood pressure in adults is lower than 120/80 mmHg. Hypotension is blood pressure that\\'s lower than 90/60 mmHg.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nBlood pressure doesn\\'t stay the same all the time. It lowers as you sleep and rises when you wake up. Blood pressure also rises when you\\'re excited, nervous, or active.\\n                \\nYour body is very sensitive to changes in blood pressure. For example, if you stand up quickly, your blood pressure may drop for a short time. Your body adjusts your blood pressure to make sure enough blood and oxygen are flowing to your brain, kidneys, and other vital organs.\\n                \\nMost forms of hypotension happen because your body can\\'t bring blood pressure back to normal or can\\'t do it fast enough.\\n                \\nSome people have low blood pressure all the time. They have no signs or symptoms, and their low blood pressure is normal for them.\\n                \\nIn other people, certain conditions or factors cause abnormally low blood pressure. As a result, less blood and oxygen flow to the body\\'s organs.\\n                \\nFor the most part, hypotension is a medical concern only if it causes signs or symptoms or is linked to a serious condition, such as heart disease. Signs and symptoms of hypotension may include dizziness, fainting, cold and sweaty skin, fatigue (tiredness), blurred vision, or nausea (feeling sick to your stomach).\\n                \\nIn extreme cases, hypotension can lead to shock.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nIn a healthy person, low blood pressure without signs or symptoms usually isn\\'t a problem and needs no treatment. If it causes signs or symptoms, your doctor will try to find and treat the condition that\\'s causing it.\\n                \\nHypotension can be dangerous. It can make you fall because of dizziness or fainting. Shock, a severe form of hypotension, is a condition that\\'s often fatal if not treated right away. With prompt and proper treatment, shock can be successfully treated.']}"}, "time": 1746283465.60772}
