If someone has a family history of metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) or someone is known to be a carrier for MLD, individuals who are biologically related to the affected individual or carrier are at risk to be a carrier. Generally speaking, the more closely related an individual is to the affected individual or carrier, the greater the chance for that person to be a carrier. Prior to genetic testing, the chance to be a carrier for some biological relatives of an affected individual are as follows: Parent of affected individual: assumed to be 100% (called an obligate carrier) Unaffected sibling of affected individual: 2 in 3 (~66.6%) Aunt or uncle of affected individual: 1 in 2 (50%) First cousin of affected individual: 1 in 4 (25%) If someone has carrier testing and is found to be negative (not a carrier), that person's children are typically assumed to be negative also. More information about the use of genetic carrier testing is available on GeneTests' Web site and can be viewed by clicking here. Individuals who are interested in learning about genetic testing and about their specific risk to be a carrier should speak with a genetics professional.\", 'Popliteal pterygium syndrome is a condition that affects the development of the face, skin, and genitals. Most people with this disorder are born with a cleft lip and/or a cleft palate. Affected individuals may have depressions (pits) near the center of the lower lip and small mounds of tissue on the lower lip. In some cases, people with popliteal pterygium syndrome have missing teeth. Other features may include webs of skin on the backs of the legs across the knee joint, webbing or fusion of the fingers or toes (syndactyly), characteristic triangular folds of skin over the nails of the large toes, and tissue connecting the upper and lower eyelids or the upper and lower jaw. Affected individuals may also have abnormal genitals. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and is caused by mutations in the IRF6 gene.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Popliteal pterygium syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Popliteal pterygium syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Cleft palate 90% Hypertrichosis 90% Limitation of joint mobility 90% Thin vermilion border 90% Toe syndactyly 90% Abnormality of female external genitalia 50% Abnormality of the palpebral fissures 50% Abnormality of the ribs 50% Abnormality of the toenails 50% Bifid scrotum 50% Cryptorchidism 50% Finger syndactyly 50% Lip pit 50% Non-midline cleft lip 50% Popliteal pterygium 50% Scoliosis 50% Scrotal hypoplasia 50% Talipes 50% Choanal atresia 7.5% Cognitive impairment 7.5% Split hand 7.5% Ankyloblepharon - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Cleft upper lip - Cutaneous finger syndactyly - Dementia - Fibrous syngnathia - Hypoplasia of the uterus - Hypoplasia of the vagina - Hypoplastic labia majora - Intercrural pterygium - Lower lip pit - Pyramidal skinfold extending from the base to the top of the nails - Spina bifida occulta - Talipes equinovarus - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Dermatomyositis is one of a group of acquired muscle diseases called inflammatory myopathies (disorder of muscle tissue or muscles), which are characterized by chronic muscle inflammation accompanied by muscle weakness. The cardinal symptom is a skin rash that precedes or accompanies progressive muscle weakness. Dermatomyositis may occur at any age, but is most common in adults in their late 40s to early 60s, or children between 5 and 15 years of age. There is no cure for dermatomyositis, but the symptoms can be treated. Options include medication, physical therapy, exercise, heat therapy (including microwave and ultrasound), orthotics and assistive devices, and rest. The cause of dermatomyositis is unknown.']}"}, "time": 1746283456.595716}
