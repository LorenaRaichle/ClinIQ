The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Wells-Jankovic syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Gait disturbance 90% Hemiplegia/hemiparesis 90% Hyperreflexia 90% Hypertonia 90% Impaired pain sensation 90% Sensorineural hearing impairment 90% Abnormality of the genital system 50% Opacification of the corneal stroma 50% Short stature 50% Visual impairment 50% Incoordination 7.5% Nystagmus 7.5% Cataract - Hearing impairment - Hypogonadism - Juvenile onset - Spastic paraparesis - Tremor - X-linked inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) is a chronic, severe allergy that affects the surfaces of the eyes. It most commonly occurs in boys living in warm, dry climates. Attacks associated with VKC are common in the spring (hence the name \"vernal\") and summer but often reoccur in the winter. Signs and symptoms usually begin before 10 years of age and may include hard, cobblestone-like bumps (papillae) on the upper eyelid; sensitivity to light; redness; sticky mucus discharge; and involuntary blinking or spasms of the eyelid (blepharospasm). The condition usually subsides at the onset of puberty. It is caused by a hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) to airborne-allergens. Management focuses on preventing \"flare ups\" and relieving the symptoms of the condition.', 'How might vernal keratoconjunctivitis be treated? Management of vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) focuses on preventing allergic attacks as well as relieving the signs and symptoms of the condition. It is often recommended that affected individuals try to avoid the agent that causes the allergy (if possible); wear dark sunglasses in the daytime; avoid dust; and stay inside on hot afternoons. Eye drops that affect the amount of histamine released by immune system cells (called mast cell stabilizers) may be used at the beginning of the season or at the first sign of a \"flare-up\" to prevent severe symptoms; however, they are not considered effective at relieving symptoms. Topical eye drops are generally preferred as the first source of treatment. Cold compresses, artificial tears, ointments and/or topical antihistamines may help. Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) may relieve symptoms in moderate cases; topical steroids are typically only used for more severe cases because long-term use can cause glaucoma. A few prescription drugs may also be available for the treatment of VKC; these include cromolyn sodium, lodoxamide tromethamine and Levocabastine. Oral administration of montelukast, a drug usually prescribed for asthma, has also been shown to be an effective treatment of VKC. For more information about these drugs and their availability, individuals should speak with their health care providers.', 'Biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease is a rare condition that affects the brain and other parts of the nervous system. The severity of the condition and the associated signs and symptoms vary from person to person, even within the same family. Without early diagnosis and treatment, most affected people develop features of the condition between ages 3 and 10 years. Signs and symptoms may include recurrent episodes of confusion, seizures, ataxia (problems coordinating movements), dystonia, facial palsy (weakness of the facial muscles), external ophthalmoplegia (paralysis of the muscles surrounding the eye), and dysphagia. Eventually, these episodes can lead to coma or even death. Biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease is caused by changes (mutations) in the SLC19A3 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. As its name suggests, early and lifelong treatment with the vitamins biotin and thiamine may improve the symptoms.']}"}, "time": 1746283459.518593}
