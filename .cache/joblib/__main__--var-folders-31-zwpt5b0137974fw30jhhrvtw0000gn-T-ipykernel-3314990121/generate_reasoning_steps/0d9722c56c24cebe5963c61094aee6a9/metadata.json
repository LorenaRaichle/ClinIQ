Diagnosis may include nerve conduction studies, ultrasounds or MRI scans or computed tomographic imaging studies.The diagnosis of neurogenic TOS is especially difficult and may involve many exams, multiple specialist visits, and many different treatments. A number of disorders have symptoms similar to those of TOS, including rotator cuff injuries, fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis, complex regional pain syndrome, and tumors of the syrinx or spinal cord. These conditions must be ruled out, which may also be difficult.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Severe combined immunodeficiency, atypical? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Severe combined immunodeficiency, atypical. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal recessive inheritance - Diarrhea - Eczematoid dermatitis - Failure to thrive - Hepatomegaly - Panhypogammaglobulinemia - Pneumonia - Recurrent candida infections - Splenomegaly - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Tetra-amelia syndrome is a very rare disorder characterized by the absence of all four limbs. This syndrome can also cause severe malformations of other parts of the body, including the face and head, heart, nervous system, skeleton, and genitalia. The lungs are underdeveloped in many cases, which makes breathing difficult or impossible. Because children with tetra-amelia syndrome have such serious medical problems, most are stillborn or die shortly after birth. The condition has been associated with a mutation in the WNT3 gene in one family, and it appears to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Tetra-amelia syndrome?
