The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.  Very rarely, this condition is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. The gene associated with X-linked recessive Fanconi anemia is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.', \"These resources address the diagnosis or management of Fanconi anemia:  - Cincinnati Children's Hospital: Fanconi Anemia Comprehensive Care Center  - Fanconi Anemia Research Fund: Fanconi Anemia Guidelines for Diagnosis and Management  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Fanconi Anemia  - Genetic Testing Registry: Fanconi anemia  - Genetic Testing Registry: Fanconi anemia, complementation group A  - Genetic Testing Registry: Fanconi anemia, complementation group B  - Genetic Testing Registry: Fanconi anemia, complementation group C  - Genetic Testing Registry: Fanconi anemia, complementation group D1  - Genetic Testing Registry: Fanconi anemia, complementation group D2  - Genetic Testing Registry: Fanconi anemia, complementation group E  - Genetic Testing Registry: Fanconi anemia, complementation group F  - Genetic Testing Registry: Fanconi anemia, complementation group G  - Genetic Testing Registry: Fanconi anemia, complementation group I  - Genetic Testing Registry: Fanconi anemia, complementation group J  - Genetic Testing Registry: Fanconi anemia, complementation group L  - Genetic Testing Registry: Fanconi anemia, complementation group M  - Genetic Testing Registry: Fanconi anemia, complementation group N  - Genetic Testing Registry: Fanconi anemia, complementation group O  - Genetic Testing Registry: Fanconi anemia, complementation group P  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Fanconi's Anemia  - National Cancer Institute: Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment PDQ  - National Cancer Institute: Myelodysplastic Syndromes Treatment PDQ  - National Heart Lung and Blood Institute: How is Fanconi Anemia Treated?  - The Rockefeller University: International Fanconi Anemia Registry   These resources from MedlinePlus offer information about the diagnosis and management of various health conditions:  - Diagnostic Tests  - Drug Therapy  - Surgery and Rehabilitation  - Genetic Counseling   - Palliative Care\", 'Glycogen storage disease type VI (also known as GSDVI or Hers disease) is an inherited disorder caused by an inability to break down a complex sugar called glycogen in liver cells. A lack of glycogen breakdown interferes with the normal function of the liver.  The signs and symptoms of GSDVI typically begin in infancy to early childhood. The first sign is usually an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly). Affected individuals may also have low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) or a buildup of lactic acid in the body (lactic acidosis) during prolonged periods without food (fasting).  The signs and symptoms of GSDVI tend to improve with age; most adults with this condition do not have any related health problems.', 'The exact prevalence of GSDVI is unknown. At least 11 cases have been reported in the medical literature, although this condition is likely to be underdiagnosed because it can be difficult to detect in children with mild symptoms or adults with no symptoms. GSDVI is more common in the Old Older Mennonite population, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 1,000 individuals.']}"}, "time": 1746283453.0976498}
