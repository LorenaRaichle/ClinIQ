Paget's disease is often found by accident when a person undergoes one of these tests for another reason. In other cases, a person experiences problems that lead his or her physician to order these tests. If Paget's disease is first suggested by an alkaline phosphatase blood test or bone scan, the physician usually orders an x-ray to verify the diagnosis. A bone scan is typically used to identify all the bones in the skeleton that are affected by the disease.\", 'The Food and Drug Administration has approved several medications that can stop or slow down the progression of the disease and reduce pain and other symptoms. These medications fall into two categories: bisphosphonates and calcitonin. Doctors most often prescribe one of the four strongest bisphosphonates, which are risedronate, alendronate, pamidronate, and zoledronic acid.', \"Yes. Some complications from Paget's disease respond well to surgery. Joint replacement may be helpful in people with severe arthritis of the hip or knee. Surgery can also realign affected leg bones to reduce pain or help broken bones heal in a better position.\", 'Medicare is a federal health insurance program for people - age 65 and older - under age 65 with certain disabilities who have been receiving Social Security disability benefits for a certain amount of time (24 months in most cases) - of any age who have End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), which is permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a transplant. age 65 and older under age 65 with certain disabilities who have been receiving Social Security disability benefits for a certain amount of time (24 months in most cases) of any age who have End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), which is permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a transplant.
