McCune Albright syndrome (MAS) is caused by a change (mutation) in the GNAS gene. This gene provides instructions for making part of a protein that ultimately influences many cell functions by regulating hormone activity. GNAS gene mutations that cause MAS result in a protein that causes the enzyme adenylate cyclase to be constantly turned on. This, in turn, leads to over-production of several hormones, resulting in the signs and symptoms of MAS.', \"Is McCune Albright syndrome inherited? McCune Albright syndrome (MAS) is not inherited. It is caused by a random change (mutation) in the GNAS gene that occurs very early in development. As a result, some of the body's cells have a normal version of the GNAS gene, while other cells have the mutated version. This phenomenon is called mosaicism. The severity of this disorder and its specific features depend on the number and location of cells that have the mutated GNAS gene. This mutation is not passed on to any of the affected individual's children.\", \"How might McCune Albright syndrome be treated? Although there is no cure for McCune Albright syndrome (MAS), drug treatments may help some of the endocrine symptoms, and surgery can help repair some of the bone problems. Generally, treatment depends on what tissues are affected as well as the severity. Surgery may be needed to manage complications associated with fibrous dysplasia, such as progressive visual disturbance, severe pain, and severe disfigurement. Surgery may also be needed to manage associated endocrine abnormalities and/or cancers. Bisphosphonates are frequently used to treat fibrous dysplasia. Strengthening exercises are recommended to help maintain musculature around the bones and minimize the risk of fracture. Treatment of all endocrine symptoms, whether by hormone inhibitors or surgery, is commonly required. More detailed information about the management of MAS syndrome is available on Medscape Reference's Web site.\", 'What are the signs and symptoms of Glomerulopathy with fibronectin deposits 2? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Glomerulopathy with fibronectin deposits 2. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Edema of the lower limbs 90% Glomerulopathy 90% Hematuria 90% Hypertension 90% Nephrotic syndrome 90% Proteinuria 90% Renal insufficiency 90% Intracranial hemorrhage 7.5% Autosomal dominant inheritance - Generalized distal tubular acidosis - Microscopic hematuria - Renal cell carcinoma - Slow progression - Stage 5 chronic kidney disease - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.']}"}, "time": 1746283460.294776}
