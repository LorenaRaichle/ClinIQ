The body digests food using the movement of muscles in the GI tract, along with the release of hormones and enzymes. Cyclic vomiting syndrome affects the upper GI tract, which includes the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and duodenum, the first part of the small intestine. The esophagus is the muscular tube that carries food and liquids from the mouth to the stomach. The stomach slowly pumps the food and liquids through the duodenum and into the rest of the small intestine, which absorbs nutrients from food particles. This process is automatic and people are usually not aware of it, though people sometimes feel food in their esophagus when they swallow something too large, try to eat too quickly, or drink hot or cold liquids.', 'The cause of cyclic vomiting syndrome is unknown. However, some experts believe that some possible problems with bodily functions may contribute to the cause, such as the following:\\n                \\n- gastrointestinal motilitythe way food moves through the digestive system  - central nervous system functionincludes the brain, spinal cord, and nerves that control bodily responses  - autonomic nervous system functionnerves that control internal organs such as the heart  - hormone imbalanceshormones are a chemical produced in one part of the body and released into the blood to trigger or regulate particular bodily functions  - in children, an abnormal inherited gene may also contribute to the condition\\n                \\nSpecific conditions or events may trigger an episode of cyclic vomiting:\\n                \\n- emotional stress, anxiety, or panic attacksfor example, in children, common triggers of anticipatory anxiety are school exams or events, birthday parties, holidays, family conflicts, or travel  - infections, such as a sinus infection, a respiratory infection, or the flu  - eating certain foods, such as chocolate or cheese, or additives such as caffeine, nitritescommonly found in cured meats such as hot dogsand monosodium glutamate, also called MSG  - hot weather  - menstrual periods  - motion sickness  - overeating, fasting, or eating right before bedtime  - physical exhaustion or too much exercise', 'Cyclic vomiting syndrome is more common in children than adults, although reports of the syndrome in adults have increased in recent years.1 Usually, children are about 5 years old when diagnosed with cyclic vomiting syndrome, which occurs in every three out of 100,000 children.2', 'The main symptoms of cyclic vomiting syndrome are severe nausea and sudden vomiting lasting hours to days. A person may also experience one or more of the following symptoms:\\n                \\n- retching, or making an attempt to vomit  - heaving or gagging  - lack of appetite  - abdominal pain  - diarrhea  - fever  - dizziness  - headache  - sensitivity to light\\n                \\nIntensity of symptoms will vary as a person cycles through four distinct phases of an episode:\\n                \\n- Prodrome phase. During the prodrome phase, the person feels that an episode of nausea and vomiting is about to start. Often marked by intense sweating and nauseawith or without abdominal painthis phase can last from a few minutes to several hours. The person may appear unusually pale.  - Vomiting phase. This phase consists of intense nausea, vomiting, and retching. Periods of vomiting and retching can last 20 to 30 minutes at a time. The person may be subdued and responsive, immobile and unresponsive, or writhing and moaning with intense abdominal pain. An episode can last from hours to days.  - Recovery phase. This phase begins when the vomiting and retching stop and the nausea subsides. Improvement of symptoms during the recovery phase can vary. Healthy color, appetite, and energy return gradually or right away.  - Well phase. This phase occurs between episodes when no symptoms are present.']}"}, "time": 1746283484.950243}
