While no standard treatment has been found to work for every patient, there are several options that have been used to successfully manage the symptoms in a number of cases. Patients are often advised to recline or lower the head between the knees when symptoms occur. They may also be advised to avoid diuretics and/or increase weight. Medications which have been shown to work in some patients include nasal sprays containing anticholinergics, estrogen, diluted hydrochloric acid, chlorobutanol, or benzyl alcohol. Surgical treatment may be indicated in some cases. Information detailing treatment options can be accessed through Medscape Reference.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Trichodental syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Trichodental syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the eyelashes 90% Abnormality of the nares 90% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the eyebrow 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Fine hair 90% Microcephaly 90% Narrow forehead 90% Narrow nasal bridge 90% Reduced number of teeth 90% Slow-growing hair 90% Autosomal dominant inheritance - Brittle hair - Conical tooth - Hypodontia - Shell teeth - Sparse hair - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Mannosidosis, beta A, lysosomal?
