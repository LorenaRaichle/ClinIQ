Emphysema is a serious lung disease in which damage to the airways makes it hard to breathe.\\n                \\nA small number of people who have AAT deficiency develop cirrhosis (sir-RO-sis) and other serious liver diseases.\\n                \\nCirrhosis is a disease in which the liver becomes scarred. The scarring prevents the organ from working well. In people who have AAT deficiency, cirrhosis and other liver diseases usually occur in infancy and early childhood.\\n                \\nA very small number of people who have AAT deficiency have a rare skin disease called necrotizing panniculitis (pa-NIK-yu-LI-tis). This disease can cause painful lumps under or on the surface of the skin.\\n                \\nThis article focuses on AAT deficiency as it relates to lung disease.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nAlpha-1 antitrypsin, also called AAT, is a protein made in the liver. Normally, the protein travels through the bloodstream. It helps protect the body\\'s organs from the harmful effects of other proteins. The lungs are one of the main organs that the AAT protein protects.\\n                \\nAAT deficiency occurs if the AAT proteins made in the liver aren\\'t the right shape. They get stuck inside liver cells and can\\'t get into the bloodstream.\\n                \\nAs a result, not enough AAT proteins travel to the lungs to protect them. This increases the risk of lung disease. Also, because too many AAT proteins are stuck in the liver, liver disease can develop.\\n                \\nSevere AAT deficiency occurs if blood levels of the AAT protein fall below the lowest amount needed to protect the lungs.\\n                \\nAAT deficiency is an inherited condition. \"Inherited\" means it\\'s passed from parents to children through genes.\\n                \\nDoctors don\\'t know how many people have AAT deficiency. Many people who have the condition may not know they have it. Estimates of how many people have AAT deficiency range from about 1 in every 1,600 people to about 1 in every 5,000 people.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nPeople who have AAT deficiency may not have serious complications, and they may live close to a normal lifespan.\\n                \\nAmong people with AAT deficiency who have a related lung or liver disease, about 3percent die each year.\\n                \\nSmoking is the leading risk factor for life-threatening lung disease if you have AAT deficiency. Smoking or exposure to tobacco smoke increases the risk of earlier lung-related symptoms and lung damage. If you have severe AAT deficiency, smoking can shorten your life by as much as 20 years.\\n                \\nAAT deficiency has no cure, but treatments are available. Treatments often are based on the type of disease you develop.', 'Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is an inherited disease. \"Inherited\" means it\\'s passed from parents to children through genes.\\n                \\nChildren who have AAT deficiency inherit two faulty AAT genes, one from each parent. These genes tell cells in the body how to make AAT proteins.\\n                \\nIn AAT deficiency, the AAT proteins made in the liver aren\\'t the right shape. Thus, they get stuck in the liver cells. The proteins can\\'t get to the organs in the body that they protect, such as the lungs. Without the AAT proteins protecting the organs, diseases can develop.\\n                \\nThe most common faulty gene that can cause AAT deficiency is called PiZ. If you inherit two PiZ genes (one from each parent), you\\'ll have AAT deficiency.\\n                \\nIf you inherit a PiZ gene from one parent and a normal AAT gene from the other parent, you won\\'t have AAT deficiency. However, you might pass the PiZ gene to your children.\\n                \\nEven if you inherit two faulty AAT genes, you may not have any related complications. You may never even realize that you have AAT deficiency.', 'Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency occurs in all ethnic groups. However, the condition occurs most often in White people of European descent.\\n                \\nAAT deficiency is an inherited condition. \"Inherited\" means the condition is passed from parents to children through genes.\\n                \\nIf you have bloodline relatives with known AAT deficiency, you\\'re at increased risk for the condition. Even so, it doesn\\'t mean that you\\'ll develop one of the diseases related to the condition.\\n                \\nSome risk factors make it more likely that you\\'ll develop lung disease if you have AAT deficiency. Smoking is the leading risk factor for serious lung disease if you have AAT deficiency. Your risk for lung disease also may go up if you\\'re exposed to dust, fumes, or other toxic substances.', \"The first lung-related symptoms of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency may include shortness of breath, less ability to be physically active, and wheezing. These signs and symptoms most often begin between the ages of 20 and 40.\\n                \\nOther signs and symptoms may include repeated lung infections, tiredness, a rapid heartbeat upon standing, vision problems, and weight loss.\\n                \\nSome people who have severe AAT deficiency develop emphysema (em-fi-SE-ma)often when they're only in their forties or fifties. Signs and symptoms of emphysema include problems breathing, wheezing, and a chronic (ongoing) cough.\\n                \\nAt first, many people who have AAT deficiency are diagnosed with asthma. This is because wheezing also is a symptom of asthma. Also, people who have AAT deficiency respond well to asthma medicines.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283465.332382}
