Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk to your doctor if you think you may be at risk for breast cancer.    Risk factors for breast cancer include the following:            - A personal history of invasive breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS).     - A personal history of benign (noncancer) breast disease.     - A family history of breast cancer in a first-degree relative (mother, daughter, or sister).     - Inherited changes in the  BRCA1  or  BRCA2  genes or in other genes that increase the risk of breast cancer.     - Breast tissue that is dense on a mammogram.     -  Exposure of breast tissue to estrogen made by the body. This may be caused by:                  -  Menstruating at an early age.       -  Older age at first birth or never having given birth.       - Starting menopause at a later age.                - Taking hormones such as estrogen combined with progestin for symptoms of menopause.     - Treatment with radiation therapy to the breast/chest.     - Drinking alcohol.     -  Obesity.           Older age is the main risk factor for most cancers. The chance of getting cancer increases as you get older.      NCI's Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool uses a woman's risk factors to estimate her risk for breast cancer during the next five years and up to age 90. This online tool is meant to be used by a health care provider. For more information on breast cancer risk, call 1-800-4-CANCER.\", 'The use of certain medicines and other factors decrease the risk of breast cancer. Anything that decreases your chance of getting a disease is called a protective factor.    Protective factors for breast cancer include the following:            - Taking any of the following:                  -  Estrogen-only hormone therapy after a hysterectomy.       -  Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs).        -  Aromatase inhibitors.                - Less exposure of breast tissue to estrogen made by the body. This can be a result of:                  - Early pregnancy.       - Breastfeeding.                - Getting enough exercise.     - Having any of the following procedures:                  -  Mastectomy to reduce the risk of cancer.       -  Oophorectomy to reduce the risk of cancer.       -  Ovarian ablation.', 'Breast cancer is sometimes caused by inherited gene mutations (changes). The genes in cells carry the hereditary information that is received from a persons parents. Hereditary breast cancer makes up about 5% to 10% of all breast cancer. Some mutated genes related to breast cancer are more common in certain ethnic groups.   Women who have certain gene mutations, such as a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, have an increased risk of breast cancer. These women also have an increased risk of ovarian cancer, and may have an increased risk of other cancers. Men who have a mutated gene related to breast cancer also have an increased risk of breast cancer. For more information, see the PDQ summary on Male Breast Cancer Treatment.   There are tests that can detect (find) mutated genes. These genetic tests are sometimes done for members of families with a high risk of cancer. See the PDQ summary on Genetics of Breast and Gynecologic Cancers for more information.', \"Signs of breast cancer include a lump or change in the breast. These and other signs may be caused by breast cancer or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:         - A lump or thickening in or near the breast or in the underarm area.    - A change in the size or shape of the breast.    - A dimple or puckering in the skin of the breast.    - A nipple turned inward into the breast.    - Fluid, other than breast milk, from the nipple, especially if it's bloody.    - Scaly, red, or swollen skin on the breast, nipple, or areola (the dark area of skin around the nipple).    - Dimples in the breast that look like the skin of an orange, called peau dorange.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283465.226889}
