The pleura is a membrane that consists of two large, thin layers of tissue. One layer wraps around the outside of your lungs. The other layer lines the inside of your chest cavity.\\n                \\nBetween the layers of tissue is a very thin space called the pleural space. Normally this space is filled with a small amount of fluidabout 4 teaspoons full. The fluid helps the two layers of the pleura glide smoothly past each other as you breathe in and out.\\n                \\nPleurisy occurs if the two layers of the pleura become irritated and inflamed. Instead of gliding smoothly past each other, they rub together every time you breathe in. The rubbing can cause sharp pain.\\n                \\nMany conditions can cause pleurisy, including viral infections.\\n                \\nOther Pleural Disorders\\n                \\nPneumothorax\\n                \\nAir or gas can build up in the pleural space. When this happens, it's called a pneumothorax (noo-mo-THOR-aks). A lung disease or acute lung injury can cause a pneumothorax.\\n                \\nSome lung procedures also can cause a pneumothorax. Examples include lung surgery, drainage of fluid with a needle,bronchoscopy (bron-KOS-ko-pee), andmechanical ventilation.\\n                \\nSometimes the cause of a pneumothorax isn't known.\\n                \\nThe most common symptoms of a pneumothorax are sudden pain in one side of the lung and shortness of breath. The air or gas in the pleural space also can put pressure on the lung and cause it to collapse.\\n                \\nPleurisy and Pneumothorax\\n                \\n\\n                \\nA small pneumothorax may go away without treatment. A large pneumothorax may require a procedure to remove air or gas from the pleural space.\\n                \\nA very large pneumothorax can interfere with blood flow through your chest and cause your blood pressure to drop. This is called a tension pneumothorax.\\n                \\nPleural Effusion\\n                \\nIn some cases of pleurisy, excess fluid builds up in the pleural space. This is called a pleural effusion. A lot of extra fluid can push the pleura against your lung until the lung, or part of it, collapses. This can make it hard for you to breathe.\\n                \\nSometimes the extra fluid gets infected and turns into an abscess. When this happens, it's called an empyema (em-pi-E-ma).\\n                \\nYou can develop a pleural effusion even if you don't have pleurisy. For example,pneumonia, (nu-MO-ne-ah),heart failure, cancer, or pulmonary embolism (PULL-mun-ary EM-bo-lizm) can lead to a pleural effusion.\\n                \\nHemothorax\\n                \\nBlood also can build up in the pleural space. This condition is called a hemothorax (he-mo-THOR-aks). An injury to your chest, chest or heart surgery, or lung or pleural cancer can cause a hemothorax.\\n                \\nA hemothorax can put pressure on the lung and cause it to collapse. A hemothorax also can cause shock. In shock, not enough blood and oxygen reach your body's vital organs.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nPleurisy and other pleural disorders can be serious, depending on their causes. If the condition that caused the pleurisy or other pleural disorder isn't too serious and is diagnosed and treated early, you usually can expect a full recovery.\", \"Pleurisy\\n                \\nMany conditions can cause pleurisy. Viral infections are likely the most common cause. Other causes of pleurisy include:\\n                \\nBacterial infections, such as pneumonia (nu-MO-ne-ah) and tuberculosis, and infections from fungi or parasites\\n                \\nPulmonary embolism, a blood clot that travels through the blood vessels to the lungs\\n                \\nAutoimmune disorders, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis\\n                \\nCancer, such as lung cancer, lymphoma, and mesothelioma (MEZ-o-thee-lee-O-ma)\\n                \\nChest and heart surgery, especially coronary artery bypass grafting\\n                \\nLung diseases, such as LAM (lymphangioleiomyomatosis) or asbestosis (as-bes-TO-sis)\\n                \\nInflammatory bowel disease\\n                \\nFamilial Mediterranean fever, an inherited condition that often causes fever and swelling in the abdomen or lungs\\n                \\nOther causes of pleurisy include chest injuries, pancreatitis (an inflamed pancreas), and reactions to certain medicines. Reactions to certain medicines can cause a condition similar to lupus. These medicines include procainamide, hydralazine, and isoniazid.\\n                \\nSometimes doctors can't find the cause of pleurisy.\\n                \\nPneumothorax\\n                \\nLung diseases or acute lung injury can make it more likely that you will develop a pneumothorax (a buildup of air or gas in the pleural space). Such lung diseases may include COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), tuberculosis, and LAM.\\n                \\nSurgery or a chest injury also may cause a pneumothorax.\\n                \\nYou can develop a pneumothorax without having a recognized lung disease or chest injury. This is called a spontaneous pneumothorax. Smoking increases your risk of spontaneous pneumothorax. Having a family history of the condition also increases your risk.\\n                \\nPleural Effusion\\n                \\nThe most common cause of a pleural effusion (a buildup of fluid in the pleural space) is heart failure. Lung cancer, LAM, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and other lung infections also can lead to a pleural effusion.\\n                \\nSometimes kidney or liver disease can cause fluid to build up in the pleural space. Asbestosis, sarcoidosis (sar-koy-DO-sis), and reactions to some medicines also can lead to a pleural effusion.\\n                \\nHemothorax\\n                \\nAn injury to the chest, chest or heart surgery, or lung or pleural cancer can cause a hemothorax (buildup of blood in the pleural space).\\n                \\nA hemothorax also can be a complication of an infection (for example, pneumonia), tuberculosis, or a spontaneous pneumothorax.\", \"Pleurisy\\n                \\nThe main symptom of pleurisy is a sharp or stabbing pain in your chest that gets worse when you breathe in deeply or cough or sneeze.\\n                \\nThe pain may stay in one place or it may spread to your shoulders or back. Sometimes the pain becomes a fairly constant dull ache.\\n                \\nDepending on what's causing the pleurisy, you may have other symptoms, such as:\\n                \\nShortness of breath or rapid, shallow breathing\\n                \\nCoughing\\n                \\nFever and chills\\n                \\nUnexplained weight loss\\n                \\nPneumothorax\\n                \\nThe symptoms of pneumothorax include:\\n                \\nSudden, sharp chest pain that gets worse when you breathe in deeply or cough\\n                \\nShortness of breath\\n                \\nChest tightness\\n                \\nEasy fatigue (tiredness)\\n                \\nA rapid heart rate\\n                \\nA bluish tint to the skin caused by lack of oxygen\\n                \\nOther symptoms of pneumothorax include flaring of the nostrils; anxiety, stress, and tension; and hypotension (low blood pressure).\\n                \\nPleural Effusion\\n                \\nPleural effusion often has no symptoms.\\n                \\nHemothorax\\n                \\nThe symptoms of hemothorax often are similar to those of pneumothorax.
