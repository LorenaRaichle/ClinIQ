Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Coloboma, cleft lip/palate and mental retardation syndrome?

Signs and symptoms can occur during infancy, childhood or adulthood depending on the form of the condition and may include low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), lack of energy, and muscle weakness. Children affected by the most severe forms of the condition are also at risk of serious complications such as liver abnormalities and life-threatening heart problems. VLCAD deficiency is caused by changes (mutations) in the ACADVL gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.']}"}, "time": 1746283457.500944}
