The most important aspect of management for G6PD deficiency is to avoid agents that might trigger an attack. In cases of acute hemolytic anemia, a blood transfusion or even an exchange transfusion may be required. The G6PD Deficiency Association, which is an advocacy group that provides information and supportive resources to individuals and families affected by G6PD deficiency, provides a list of drugs and food ingredients that individuals with this condition should avoid. They also maintain a list of low risk drugs that are generally safe to take in low doses.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Anonychia-onychodystrophy with hypoplasia or absence of distal phalanges? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Anonychia-onychodystrophy with hypoplasia or absence of distal phalanges. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the fingernails 90% Anonychia 90% Aplastic/hypoplastic toenail 90% Brachydactyly syndrome 90% Split hand 90% Triphalangeal thumb 90% Autosomal dominant inheritance - Complete duplication of thumb phalanx - High palate - Nail dysplasia - Nail dystrophy - Prominent nasal bridge - Prominent nose - Short 5th finger - Short philtrum - Shortening of all distal phalanges of the fingers - Shortening of all distal phalanges of the toes - Underdeveloped nasal alae - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Anterior segment mesenchymal dysgenesis?

Defects in many different genes cause different forms of this disease. Common symptoms may include foot drop, foot deformity, loss of lower leg muscle, numbness in the foot or leg, slapping\" gait (feet hit the floor hard when walking), and weakness of the hips, legs, or feet. There is currently no cure for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, but physical therapy, occupational therapy, braces and other orthopedic devices, pain medication, and orthopedic surgery can help manage and improve symptoms. There are over 40 types of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. You can search for more information on a particular type of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease from the GARD Home page. Enter the name of the condition in the GARD search box, and then select the type from the drop down menu.']}"}, "time": 1746283460.6555672}
