The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Duane syndrome type 1. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'How might Duane syndrome type 1 be treated? Management of Duane syndrome is mainly supportive. It may involve treatment of amblyopia (\"lazy eye\"); wearing glasses or contact lenses; the use of prisms to correct for abnormal head posture; or possible eye muscle surgery. The majority of people with Duane syndrome do not need surgery. However, surgery may be indicated if necessary to reduce severe misalignment of the eyes (strabismus); improve an unacceptable head position; treat a significant upshoot or downshoot; or fix displacement of the eyeball within the orbit (enophthalmos). Unfortunately, surgery does not restore function to the affected nerve and muscle, and no surgical technique has been completely successful in eliminating the abnormal eye movements. Surgery for Duane syndrome usually involves adjusting the other eye muscles to compensate and allow for better eye alignment. While it cannot fix the underlying problem, it can substantially improve signs or symptoms. Some surgical procedures or combinations of procedures may be successful in improving or eliminating head turns and strabismus.', 'Anophthalmia plus syndrome (APS) is a very rare syndrome that involves malformations in multiple organs of the body. The most common findings in affected individuals are anophthalmia (absence of one or both eyes) or severe microphthalmia (abnormally small eyes), and cleft lip and/or cleft palate. Other findings may include wide-set eyes (hypertelorism); low-set ears; narrowed or blocked nasal passages (choanal stenosis or atresia); sacral neural tube defect, midline abdominal wall defects, clinodactyly, eye colobomas and congenital glaucoma. It has been suggested that APS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, although the genetic cause has not yet been identified.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Anophthalmia plus syndrome? Anophthalmia plus syndrome (APS) may involve malformations in multiple organs of the body including the eyes, ears, nose, face, mouth, brain, sacral vertebrae, meninges (tissue that lines the outer part of the brain and spinal cord), abdominal wall, heart, digits (fingers and toes), and endocrine system. Based on the few cases reported in the literature, it appears that all affected individuals have had anophthalmia (absence of one or both eyes) and/or microphthalmia (abnormally small eyes). It has also been estimated that approximately 89% of affected individuals have had an oral-facial cleft (such as cleft lip and/or cleft palate). Other specific findings that have been reported in more than one affected individual include wide-set eyes (hypertelorism), low-set ears, choanal stenosis or atresia (narrowing or blockage of the nasal passages), sacral neural tube defect, midline abdominal wall defects, clinodactyly (abnormally bent or curved finger), eye colobomas, and congenital glaucoma. There have been other, additional abnormalities that have only been reported in single individuals.
