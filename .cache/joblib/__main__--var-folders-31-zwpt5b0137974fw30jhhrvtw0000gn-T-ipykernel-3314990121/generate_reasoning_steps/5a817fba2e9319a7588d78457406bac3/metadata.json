They help your muscles move your bones. Tendinitis is the severe swelling of a tendon.    Tendinitis usually happens after repeated injury to an area such as the wrist or ankle. It causes pain and soreness around a joint. Some common forms of tendinitis are named after the sports that increase their risk. They include tennis elbow, golfer's elbow, pitcher's shoulder, swimmer's shoulder, and jumper's knee.    Doctors diagnose tendinitis with your medical history, a physical exam, and imaging tests. The first step in treatment is to reduce pain and swelling. Rest, wrapping or elevating the affected area, and medicines can help. Ice is helpful for recent, severe injuries. Other treatments include ultrasound, physical therapy, steroid injections, and surgery.\", \"Tinnitus is often described as a ringing in the ears. It also can sound like roaring, clicking, hissing, or buzzing. It may be soft or loud, high pitched or low pitched. You might hear it in either one or both ears.    Millions of Americans have tinnitus. People with severe tinnitus may have trouble hearing, working or even sleeping.    Causes of tinnitus include       - Hearing loss in older people    - Exposure to loud noises    - Ear and sinus infections    - Heart or blood vessel problems    - Meniere's disease    - Brain tumors    - Hormonal changes in women    - Thyroid problems    - Certain medicines       Treatment depends on the cause. Treatments may include hearing aids, sound-masking devices, medicines, and ways to learn how to cope with the noise.    NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders\", 'Your backbone, or spine, is made up of 26 bone discs called vertebrae. The vertebrae protect your spinal cord and allow you to stand and bend. A number of problems can change the structure of the spine or damage the vertebrae and surrounding tissue. They include       - Infections    - Injuries    - Tumors    - Conditions, such as ankylosing spondylitis and scoliosis    - Bone changes that come with age, such as spinal stenosis and herniated disks       Spinal diseases often cause pain when bone changes put pressure on the spinal cord or nerves. They can also limit movement. Treatments differ by disease, but sometimes they include back braces and surgery.', \"Everyone feels stressed from time to time. Not all stress is bad. All animals have a stress response, and it can be life-saving. But chronic stress can cause both physical and mental harm.    There are at least three different types of stress:       - Routine stress related to the pressures of work, family, and other daily responsibilities    - Stress brought about by a sudden negative change, such as losing a job, divorce, or illness    - Traumatic stress, which happens when you are in danger of being seriously hurt or killed. Examples include a major accident, war, assault, or a natural disaster. This type of stress can cause post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).       Different people may feel stress in different ways. Some people experience digestive symptoms. Others may have headaches, sleeplessness, depressed mood, anger, and irritability. People under chronic stress get more frequent and severe viral infections, such as the flu or common cold. Vaccines, such as the flu shot, are less effective for them.    Some people cope with stress more effectively than others. It's important to know your limits when it comes to stress, so you can avoid more serious health effects.
