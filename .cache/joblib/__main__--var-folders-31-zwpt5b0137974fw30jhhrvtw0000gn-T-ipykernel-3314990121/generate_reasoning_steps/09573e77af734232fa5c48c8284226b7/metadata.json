The diagnosis of reticulohistiocytoma (RH) is made based on clinical presentation, histology, and immunohistochemistry profile. RH occur in isolation and are typically described as small, yellow to reddish-born nodules. The lesions usually are slightly elevated from the surrounding skin. Detailed information on histology of reticulohistiocytoma is available through DermNet NZ, an online resource about skin diseases developed by the New Zealand Dermatological Society Incorporated. There are several differential diagnoses for RH. It is important to distinguish RH from Rosai-Dorfman disease, juvenile xanthogranuloma, a variety of granulomatous conditions, and some malignant neoplasms, including histiocytic sarcoma, melanoma, and epithelioid sarcoma. Reticulohistiocytoma should also be distinguished from multicentric reticulohistiocytosis.', 'How might reticulohistiocytoma be treated? Reticulohistiocytoma (RH) typically resolve spontaneously over a period of months to years; however, surgical excision usually results in a cure.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the oral cavity 90% Anorexia 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Feeding difficulties in infancy 90% Hydrocephalus 90% Megaloblastic anemia 90% Microcephaly 90% Muscular hypotonia 90% Pallor 90% Reduced consciousness/confusion 90% Retinopathy 90% Seizures 90% Behavioral abnormality 50% Gait disturbance 50% Infantile onset 50% Skin rash 7.5% Abnormality of extrapyramidal motor function - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Cerebral cortical atrophy - Confusion - Cystathioninemia - Cystathioninuria - Decreased adenosylcobalamin - Decreased methionine synthase activity - Decreased methylcobalamin - Decreased methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity - Dementia - Failure to thrive - Hematuria - Hemolytic-uremic syndrome - High forehead - Homocystinuria - Hyperhomocystinemia - Hypomethioninemia - Intellectual disability - Lethargy - Long face - Low-set ears - Macrotia - Metabolic acidosis - Methylmalonic acidemia - Methylmalonic aciduria - Nephropathy - Neutropenia - Nystagmus - Pigmentary retinopathy - Proteinuria - Reduced visual acuity - Renal insufficiency - Smooth philtrum - Thrombocytopenia - Thromboembolism - Tremor - Visual impairment - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', \"Alpha-thalassemia is a blood disorder that reduces the body's production of hemoglobin. Affected people have anemia, which can cause pale skin, weakness, fatigue, and more serious complications. Two types of alpha-thalassemia can cause health problems: the more severe type is known as Hb Bart syndrome; the milder form is called HbH disease. Hb Bart syndrome may be characterized by hydrops fetalis; severe anemia; hepatosplenomegaly; heart defects; and abnormalities of the urinary system or genitalia. Most babies with this condition are stillborn or die soon after birth. HbH disease may cause mild to moderate anemia; hepatosplenomegaly; jaundice; or bone changes. Alpha-thalassemia typically results from deletions involving the HBA1 and HBA2 genes. The inheritance is complex, and can be read about here. No treatment is effective for Hb Bart syndrome. For HbH disease, occasional red blood cell transfusions may be needed.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283458.0541592}
