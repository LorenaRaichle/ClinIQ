The infections are usually bacterial, but can also be fungal. They may spread to the bone from nearby skin or muscles, or from another part of the body through the bloodstream. People who are at risk for bone infections include those with diabetes, poor circulation, or recent injury to the bone. You may also be at risk if you are having hemodialysis.     Symptoms of bone infections include       - Pain in the infected area    - Chills and fever    - Swelling, warmth, and redness       A blood test or imaging test such as an x-ray can tell if you have a bone infection. Treatment includes antibiotics and often surgery.', \"Normally, if you get hurt, your body forms a blood clot to stop the bleeding. For blood to clot, your body needs cells called platelets and proteins known as clotting factors. If you have a bleeding disorder, you either do not have enough platelets or clotting factors or they don't work the way they should.     Bleeding disorders can be the result of other diseases, such as severe liver disease. They can also be inherited. Hemophilia is an inherited bleeding disorder. Bleeding disorders can also be a side effect of medicines.\", 'Summary : You may need an organ transplant if one of your organs has failed. This can happen because of illness or injury. When you have an organ transplant, doctors remove an organ from another person and place it in your body. The organ may come from a living donor or a donor who has died.    The organs that can be transplanted include       -  Heart     -  Intestine     -  Kidney    -  Liver    -  Lung     -  Pancreas        You often have to wait a long time for an organ transplant. Doctors must match donors to recipients to reduce the risk of transplant rejection. Rejection happens when your immune system attacks the new organ. If you have a transplant, you must take drugs the rest of your life to help keep your body from rejecting the new organ.', \"Summary : A hysterectomy is surgery to remove a woman's uterus or womb. The uterus is the place where a baby grows when a woman is pregnant. After a hysterectomy, you no longer have menstrual periods and can't become pregnant. Sometimes the surgery also removes the ovaries and fallopian tubes. If you have both ovaries taken out, you will enter menopause.    Your health care provider might recommend a hysterectomy if you have       - Fibroids     - Endometriosis that hasn't been cured by medicine or surgery    - Uterine prolapse - when the uterus drops into the vagina     - Cancer of the uterine, cervix, or ovaries    - Vaginal bleeding that persists despite treatment     - Chronic pelvic pain, as a last resort        Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health\"]}"}, "time": 1746283466.904268}
