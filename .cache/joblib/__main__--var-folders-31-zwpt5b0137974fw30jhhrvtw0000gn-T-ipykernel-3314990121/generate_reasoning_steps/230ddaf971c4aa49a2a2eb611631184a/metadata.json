The gene associated with this condition is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.', \"These resources address the diagnosis or management of X-linked intellectual disability, Siderius type:  - Cincinnati Children's Hospital: Cleft Lip / Cleft Palate Bottle Feeding  - Cleveland Clinic: Cleft Lip & Palate Surgery  - Genetic Testing Registry: Siderius X-linked mental retardation syndrome  - Nemours Children's Health System: Cleft Lip and Palate   These resources from MedlinePlus offer information about the diagnosis and management of various health conditions:  - Diagnostic Tests  - Drug Therapy  - Surgery and Rehabilitation  - Genetic Counseling   - Palliative Care\", \"Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy is a hereditary disorder that can cause progressive vision loss. This condition affects the retina, the specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. The disorder prevents blood vessels from forming at the edges of the retina, which reduces the blood supply to this tissue.  The signs and symptoms of familial exudative vitreoretinopathy vary widely, even within the same family. In many affected individuals, the retinal abnormalities never cause any vision problems. In others, a reduction in the retina's blood supply causes the retina to fold, tear, or separate from the back of the eye (retinal detachment). This retinal damage can lead to vision loss and blindness. Other eye abnormalities are also possible, including eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus) and a visible whiteness (leukocoria) in the normally black pupil.  Some people with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy also have reduced bone mineral density, which weakens bones and increases the risk of fractures.\", 'The prevalence of familial exudative vitreoretinopathy is unknown. It appears to be rare, although affected people with normal vision may never come to medical attention.']}"}, "time": 1746283447.7217479}
