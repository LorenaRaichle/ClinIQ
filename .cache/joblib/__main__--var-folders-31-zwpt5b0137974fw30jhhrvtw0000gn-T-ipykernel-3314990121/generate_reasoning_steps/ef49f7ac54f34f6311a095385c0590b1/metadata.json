The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.  Less often, this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.', 'These resources address the diagnosis or management of nemaline myopathy:  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Nemaline Myopathy  - Genetic Testing Registry: Nemaline myopathy  - Genetic Testing Registry: Nemaline myopathy 1  - Genetic Testing Registry: Nemaline myopathy 10  - Genetic Testing Registry: Nemaline myopathy 2  - Genetic Testing Registry: Nemaline myopathy 3  - Genetic Testing Registry: Nemaline myopathy 4  - Genetic Testing Registry: Nemaline myopathy 5  - Genetic Testing Registry: Nemaline myopathy 6  - Genetic Testing Registry: Nemaline myopathy 7  - Genetic Testing Registry: Nemaline myopathy 8  - Genetic Testing Registry: Nemaline myopathy 9   These resources from MedlinePlus offer information about the diagnosis and management of various health conditions:  - Diagnostic Tests  - Drug Therapy  - Surgery and Rehabilitation  - Genetic Counseling   - Palliative Care', 'SOX2 anophthalmia syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by abnormal development of the eyes and other parts of the body.  People with SOX2 anophthalmia syndrome are usually born without eyeballs (anophthalmia), although some individuals have small eyes (microphthalmia). The term anophthalmia is often used interchangeably with severe microphthalmia because individuals with no visible eyeballs typically have some remaining eye tissue. These eye problems can cause significant vision loss. While both eyes are usually affected in SOX2 anophthalmia syndrome, one eye may be more affected than the other.  Individuals with SOX2 anophthalmia syndrome may also have seizures, brain abnormalities, slow growth, delayed development of motor skills (such as walking), and mild to severe learning disabilities. Some people with this condition are born with a blocked esophagus (esophageal atresia), which is often accompanied by an abnormal connection between the esophagus and the trachea (tracheoesophageal fistula). Genital abnormalities have been described in affected individuals, especially males. Male genital abnormalities include undescended testes (cryptorchidism) and an unusually small penis (micropenis).', 'SOX2 anophthalmia syndrome is estimated to affect 1 in 250,000 individuals. About 10 percent to 15 percent of people with anophthalmia in both eyes have SOX2 anophthalmia syndrome.']}"}, "time": 1746283450.05566}
