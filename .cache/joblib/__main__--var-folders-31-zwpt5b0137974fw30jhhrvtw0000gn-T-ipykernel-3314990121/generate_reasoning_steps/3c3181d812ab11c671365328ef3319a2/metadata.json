The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:         - Whether the tumor is nonseminoma or seminoma.    - The size of the tumor and where it is in the body.     - The blood levels of AFP, -hCG, and LDH.    - Whether the tumor has spread to other parts of the body.    - The way the tumor responds to initial treatment.    - Whether the tumor has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).', 'Key Points\\n                    - After an extragonadal germ cell tumor has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body.     - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.    - Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.    -  The following prognostic groups are used for extragonadal germ cell tumors:         - Good prognosis     - Intermediate prognosis     - Poor prognosis\\n                \\n                \\n                    After an extragonadal germ cell tumor has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body.\\n                    The extent or spread of cancer is usually described as stages. For extragonadal germ cell tumors, prognostic groups are used instead of stages. The tumors are grouped according to how well the cancer is expected to respond to treatment. It is important to know the prognostic group in order to plan treatment.\\n                \\n                \\n                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\\n                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\\n                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of tumor as the primary tumor. For example, if an extragonadal germ cell tumor spreads to the lung, the tumor cells in the lung are actually cancerous germ cells. The disease is metastatic extragonadal germ cell tumor, not lung cancer.\\n                \\n                \\n                    The following prognostic groups are used for extragonadal germ cell tumors:\\n                    Good prognosis    A nonseminoma extragonadal germ cell tumor is in the good prognosis group if:             - the tumor is in the back of the abdomen; and     - the tumor has not spread to organs other than the lungs; and     - the levels of tumor markers AFP and -hCG are normal and LDH is slightly above normal.           A seminoma extragonadal germ cell tumor is in the good prognosis group if:            - the tumor has not spread to organs other than the lungs; and     - the level of AFP is normal; -hCG and LDH may be at any level.              Intermediate prognosis    A nonseminoma extragonadal germ cell tumor is in the intermediate prognosis group if:             - the tumor is in the back of the abdomen; and     - the tumor has not spread to organs other than the lungs; and     - the level of any one of the tumor markers (AFP, -hCG, or LDH) is more than slightly above normal.           A seminoma extragonadal germ cell tumor is in the intermediate prognosis group if:            - the tumor has spread to organs other than the lungs; and     - the level of AFP is normal; -hCG and LDH may be at any level.              Poor prognosis    A nonseminoma extragonadal germ cell tumor is in the poor prognosis group if:            - the tumor is in the chest; or     -  the tumor has spread to organs other than the lungs; or     - the level of any one of the tumor markers (AFP, -hCG, or LDH) is high.            Seminoma extragonadal germ cell tumor does not have a poor prognosis group.', \"Key Points\\n                    - There are different types of treatment for patients with extragonadal germ cell tumors.    - Three types of standard treatment are used:         - Radiation therapy     - Chemotherapy     - Surgery        - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.          - High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant        - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.    - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.    - Follow-up tests may be needed.\\n                \\n                \\n                    There are different types of treatment for patients with extragonadal germ cell tumors.\\n                    Different types of treatments are available for patients with extragonadal germ cell tumors. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Three types of standard treatment are used:\\n                    Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat seminoma.       Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly in the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.       Surgery    Patients who have benign tumors or tumor remaining after chemotherapy or radiation therapy may need to have surgery.\\n                \\n                \\n                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\\n                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\\n                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\\n                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials.

Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.   After initial treatment for extragonadal germ cell tumors, blood levels of AFP and other tumor markers continue to be checked to find out how well the treatment is working.\\n                \\n\\t\\t        \\n\\t\\t            Treatment Options for Extragonadal Germ Cell Tumors\\n\\t\\t            \\n\\t\\t                \\n\\t\\t                    Benign Teratoma\\n\\t\\t                    Treatment of benign teratomas is surgery.
