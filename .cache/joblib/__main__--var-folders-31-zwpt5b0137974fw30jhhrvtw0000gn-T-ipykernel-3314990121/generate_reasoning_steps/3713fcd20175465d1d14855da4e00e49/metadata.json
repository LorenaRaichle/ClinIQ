The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome 1. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Cellular immunodeficiency 90% Decreased antibody level in blood 50% Hepatomegaly 50% Lymphadenopathy 50% Lymphoma 50% Splenomegaly 50% Anemia 7.5% Encephalitis - Fulminant hepatitis - Hepatic encephalopathy - IgG deficiency - Immunodeficiency - Increased IgM level - Meningitis - Pancytopenia - Recurrent pharyngitis - Reduced natural killer cell activity - Thrombocytopenia - X-linked recessive inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Preaxial polydactyly type 1?

Some affected people may also experience problems in other areas of the body such as the kidneys and eyes. The severity of the condition and the associated signs and symptoms can vary significantly from person to person, even among members of the same family. Nail-patella syndrome is caused by changes (mutations) in the LMX1B gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Treatment is supportive and based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.', \"What are the signs and symptoms of Nail-patella syndrome?
