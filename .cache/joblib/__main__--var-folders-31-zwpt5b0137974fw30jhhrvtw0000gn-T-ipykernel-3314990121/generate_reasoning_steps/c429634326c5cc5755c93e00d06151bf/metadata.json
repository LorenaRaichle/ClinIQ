These diseases have some similar symptoms, such as chronic cough, rapid breathing, and shortness of breath.\\n                \\nThese diseases also harm the lungs in similar ways. For example, they damage the tissues that surround the lungs' alveoli (al-VEE-uhl-eye; air sacs) and bronchial tubes (airways). Sometimes these diseases directly damage the air sacs and airways.\\n                \\nThe various types of chILD can decrease lung function, reduce blood oxygen levels, and disturb the breathing process.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nResearchers have only begun to study, define, and understand chILD in the last decade. Currently, they don't know how many children have chILD. They also don't know how many children have each type of chILD.\\n                \\nDiagnosing chILD and its specific diseases is hard because chILD is rare and complex. Also, chILD is a broad term for a group of diseases with similar symptomsit's not a precise diagnosis.\\n                \\nInterstitial lung disease (ILD) also occurs in adults. However, the cause of ILD in adults may be different than the cause in children. Some types of chILD are similar to the adult forms of the disease. They may even have the same names as the adult forms, such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis (noo-mo-NI-tis), immunodeficiency-associated lung disease, and bronchiolitis (brong-ke-o-LI-tis) obliterans.\\n                \\nHowever, research shows that the course and outcomes of these diseases often are very different for children than for adults.\\n                \\nSome ILDs only occur in children. They include:\\n                \\nLung growth abnormalities\\n                \\nNeuroendocrine (noor-o-EN-do-krin) cell hyperplasia (hi-per-PLA-ze-ah) of infancy (NEHI)\\n                \\nPulmonary interstitial glycogenosis (gli-ko-JEN-eh-sis)\\n                \\nDevelopmental disorders, such as alveolar (al-VE-o-lar) capillary dysplasia\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nEach form of chILD may differ in its severity and how it's treated. Thus, getting a correct diagnosis is vital for understanding and treating your child's illness.\\n                \\nYou may want to consult a pediatric pulmonologist. This is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating children who have lung diseases and conditions. This doctor's training and experience can help him or her diagnose chILD.\\n                \\nThe outlook for children who have chILD also depends on the specific type of disease they have. Some diseases are very severe and lead to early death. Others are chronic (long-term) diseases that parents and the child's medical team must work together to manage.\\n                \\nAt this time, chILD has no cure. However, some children who have certain diseases, such as NEHI, may slowly improve over time.\\n                \\nResearchers are now starting to learn more about the causes of chILD. They're also trying to find distinct patterns and traits for the various forms of chILD. This information may help doctors better understand these diseases.\", \"Researchers don't yet know all of the causes of childhood interstitial lung disease (chILD). Many times, these diseases have no clear cause.\\n                \\nSome conditions and factors that may cause or lead to chILD include:\\n                \\nInherited conditions, such as surfactant disorders. Surfactant is a liquid that coats the inside of the lungs. It helps with breathing and may help protect the lungs from bacterial and viral infections.\\n                \\nBirth defects that cause problems with the structure or function of the lungs.\\n                \\nAspiration (as-pih-RA-shun). This term refers to inhaling substancessuch as food, liquid, or vomitinto the lungs. Inhaling these substances can injure the lungs. Aspiration may occur in children who have swallowing problems or gastroesophageal (GAS-tro-eh-so-fa-JE-al) reflux disease (GERD). GERD occurs if acid from the stomach backs up into the throat.\\n                \\nImmune system disorders. The immune system protects the body against bacteria, viruses, and toxins. Children who have immune system disorders aren't able to fight illness and disease as well as children who have healthy immune systems.\\n                \\nExposure to substances in the environment that can irritate the lungs, such as molds and chemicals.\\n                \\nSome cancer treatments, such as radiation and chemotherapy.\\n                \\nSystemic or autoimmune diseases, such as collagen vascular disease or inflammatory bowel disease. Systemic diseases are diseases that involve many of the body's organs. Autoimmune diseases occur if the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the body's tissues and cells.\\n                \\nA bone marrow transplant or a lung transplant.\", 'Childhood interstitial lung disease (chILD) is rare. Most children are not at risk for chILD. However, some factors increase the risk of developing chILD. These risk factors include:\\n                \\nHaving a family history of interstitial lung disease or chILD.\\n                \\nHaving an inherited surfactant disorder or a family history of this type of disorder.
