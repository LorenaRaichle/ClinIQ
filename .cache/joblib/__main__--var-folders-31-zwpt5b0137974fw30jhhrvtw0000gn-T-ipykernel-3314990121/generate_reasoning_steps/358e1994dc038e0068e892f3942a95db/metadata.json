These problems are most likely to occur in children and in adults with weak immune systems.     You can get E. coli infections by eating foods containing the bacteria. Symptoms of infection include       - Nausea or vomiting    - Severe abdominal cramps    - Watery or very bloody diarrhea    - Fatigue    - Fever       To help avoid food poisoning and prevent infection, handle food safely. Cook meat well, wash fruits and vegetables before eating or cooking them, and avoid unpasteurized milk and juices.

The aim is to find the best fit between you and your job conditions. Examples of ergonomic changes to your work might include       -  Adjusting the position of your computer keyboard to prevent carpal tunnel syndrome     -  Being sure that the height of your desk chair allows your feet to rest flat on floor    -  Learning the right way to lift heavy objects to prevent back injuries     -  Using handle coatings or special gloves to suppress vibrations from power tools       No matter what the job is, the goal is to make sure that you are safe, comfortable, and less prone to work-related injuries.', \"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a type of bacteria that causes infection in the stomach. It is found in about two-thirds of the world's population. It may be spread by unclean food and water, but researchers aren't sure. It causes Peptic ulcers and can also cause stomach cancer.    If you have symptoms of a peptic ulcer, your doctor will test your blood, breath or stool to see if it contains H. pylori.

To help prevent an H. pylori infection, you should       - Wash your hands after using the bathroom and before eating    - Eat properly prepared food    - Drink water from a clean, safe source       NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\"]}"}, "time": 1746283467.207915}
