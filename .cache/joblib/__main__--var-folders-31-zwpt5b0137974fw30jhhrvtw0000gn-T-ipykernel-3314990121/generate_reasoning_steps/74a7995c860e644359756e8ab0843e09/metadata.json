Its usually a symptom of coronary heart disease (CHD), but it also can be a symptom of coronary microvascular disease (MVD). So, if youre at risk for CHD or coronary MVD, youre also at risk for angina.\\n                \\nThe major risk factors for CHD and coronary MVD include:\\n                \\nUnhealthy cholesterol levels.\\n                \\nHigh blood pressure.\\n                \\nSmoking.\\n                \\nInsulin resistance or diabetes.\\n                \\nOverweight or obesity.\\n                \\nMetabolic syndrome.\\n                \\nLack of physical activity.\\n                \\nUnhealthy diet.\\n                \\nOlder age. (The risk increases for men after 45 years of age and for women after 55 years of age.)\\n                \\nFamily history of early heart disease.\\n                \\nFor more detailed information about CHD and coronary MVD risk factors, visit the Diseases and Conditions Index Coronary Heart Disease, Coronary Heart Disease Risk Factors, and Coronary Microvascular Disease articles.\\n                \\nPeople sometimes think that because men have more heart attacks than women, men also suffer from angina more often. In fact, overall, angina occurs equally among men and women.\\n                \\nMicrovascular angina, however, occurs more often in women. About 70 percent of the cases of microvascular angina occur in women around the time of menopause.\\n                \\nUnstable angina occurs more often in older adults. Variant angina is rare; it accounts for only about 2 out of 100 cases of angina. People who have variant angina often are younger than those who have other forms of angina.', \"Pain and discomfort are the main symptoms of angina. Angina often is described as pressure, squeezing, burning, or tightness in the chest. The pain or discomfort usually starts behind the breastbone.\\n                \\nPain from angina also can occur in the arms, shoulders, neck, jaw, throat, or back. The pain may feel like indigestion. Some people say that angina pain is hard to describe or that they can't tell exactly where the pain is coming from.\\n                \\nSigns and symptoms such as nausea (feeling sick to your stomach), fatigue (tiredness), shortness of breath, sweating, light-headedness, and weakness also may occur.\\n                \\nWomen are more likely to feel discomfort in the neck, jaw, throat, abdomen, or back. Shortness of breath is more common in older people and those who have diabetes. Weakness, dizziness, and confusion can mask the signs and symptoms of angina in elderly people.\\n                \\nSymptoms also vary based on the type of angina you have.\\n                \\nBecause angina has so many possible symptoms and causes, all chest pain should be checked by a doctor. Chest pain that lasts longer than a few minutes and isn't relieved by rest or angina medicine may be a sign of a heart attack.

The type of angina pain you have can be a sign of how severe the CHD is and whether it's likely to cause a heart attack.\\n                \\nIf you have chest pain, your doctor will want to find out whether it's angina. He or she also will want to know whether the angina is stable or unstable. If it's unstable, you may need emergency medical treatment to try to prevent a heart attack.\\n                \\nTo diagnose chest pain as stable or unstable angina, your doctor will do a physical exam, ask about your symptoms, and ask about your risk factors for and your family history of CHD or other heart diseases.\\n                \\nYour doctor also may ask questions about your symptoms, such as:\\n                \\nWhat brings on the pain or discomfort and what relieves it?\\n                \\nWhat does the pain or discomfort feel like (for example, heaviness or tightness)?\\n                \\nHow often does the pain occur?\\n                \\nWhere do you feel the pain or discomfort?\\n                \\nHow severe is the pain or discomfort?\\n                \\nHow long does the pain or discomfort last?\\n                \\nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\\n                \\nIf your doctor thinks that you have unstable angina or that your angina is related to a serious heart condition, he or she may recommend one or more tests.\\n                \\nEKG (Electrocardiogram)\\n                \\nAn EKG is a simple, painless test that detects and records the hearts electrical activity. The test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through the heart.\\n                \\nAn EKG can show signs of heart damage due to CHD and signs of a previous or current heart attack. However, some people who have angina have normal EKGs.\\n                \\nStress Testing\\n                \\nDuring stress testing, you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests are done. If you cant exercise, you may be given medicine to make your heart work hard and beat fast.\\n                \\nWhen your heart is working hard and beating fast, it needs more blood and oxygen. Plaque-narrowed arteries can't supply enough oxygen-rich blood to meet your heart's needs.\\n                \\nA stress test can show possible signs and symptoms of CHD, such as:\\n                \\nAbnormal changes in your heart rate or blood pressure\\n                \\nShortness of breath or chest pain\\n                \\nAbnormal changes in your heart rhythm or your heart's electrical activity\\n                \\nAs part of some stress tests, pictures are taken of your heart while you exercise and while you rest. These imaging stress tests can show how well blood is flowing in various parts of your heart. They also can show how well your heart pumps blood when it beats.\\n                \\nChest X Ray\\n                \\nA chest x ray takes pictures of the organs and structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels.\\n                \\nA chest x ray can reveal signs of heart failure. It also can show signs of lung disorders and other causes of symptoms not related to CHD. However, a chest x ray alone is not enough to diagnose angina or CHD.\\n                \\nCoronary Angiography and Cardiac Catheterization\\n                \\nYour doctor may recommend coronary angiography (an-jee-OG-ra-fee) if he or she suspects you have CHD. This test uses dye and special x rays to show the inside of your coronary arteries.\\n                \\nTo get the dye into your coronary arteries, your doctor will use a procedure called cardiac catheterization (KATH-e-ter-ih-ZA-shun).\\n                \\nA thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck. The tube is threaded into your coronary arteries, and the dye is released into your bloodstream.\\n                \\nSpecial x rays are taken while the dye is flowing through your coronary arteries. The dye lets your doctor study the flow of blood through your heart and blood vessels.\\n                \\nCardiac catheterization usually is done in a hospital. You're awake during the procedure. It usually causes little or no pain, although you may feel some soreness in the blood vessel where your doctor inserts the catheter.\\n                \\nComputed Tomography Angiography\\n                \\nComputed tomography (to-MOG-rah-fee) angiography (CTA) uses dye and special x rays to show blood flow through the coronary arteries. This test is less invasive than coronary angiography with cardiac catheterization.\\n                \\nFor CTA, a needle connected to an intravenous (IV) line is put into a vein in your hand or arm. Dye is injected through the IV line during the scan. You may have a warm feeling when this happens. The dye highlights your blood vessels on the CT scan pictures.\\n                \\nSticky patches called electrodes are put on your chest. The patches are attached to an EKG machine to record your heart's electrical activity during the scan.\\n                \\nThe CT scanner is a large machine that has a hollow, circular tube in the middle. You lie on your back on a sliding table. The table slowly slides into the opening of the machine.\\n                \\nInside the scanner, an x-ray tube moves around your body to take pictures of different parts of your heart. A computer puts the pictures together to make a three-dimensional (3D) picture of the whole heart.\\n                \\nBlood Tests\\n                \\nBlood tests check the levels of certain fats, cholesterol, sugar, and proteins in your blood. Abnormal levels may show that you have risk factors for CHD.\\n                \\nYour doctor may recommend a blood test to check the level of a protein called C-reactive protein (CRP) in your blood. Some studies suggest that high levels of CRP in the blood may increase the risk for CHD and heart attack.\\n                \\nYour doctor also may recommend a blood test to check for low levels of hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin) in your blood. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in red blood cells. It helps the blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to all parts of your body. If your hemoglobin level is low, you may have a condition called anemia (uh-NEE-me-uh).\", 'Treatments for angina include lifestyle changes, medicines, medical procedures, cardiac rehabilitation (rehab), and other therapies. The main goals of treatment are to:\\n                \\nReduce pain and discomfort and how often it occurs\\n                \\nPrevent or lower your risk for heart attack and death by treating your underlying heart condition\\n                \\nLifestyle changes and medicines may be the only treatments needed if your symptoms are mild and aren\\'t getting worse. If lifestyle changes and medicines don\\'t control angina, you may need medical procedures or cardiac rehab.\\n                \\nUnstable angina is an emergency condition that requires treatment in a hospital.\\n                \\nLifestyle Changes\\n                \\nMaking lifestyle changes can help prevent episodes of angina. You can:\\n                \\nSlow down or take rest breaks if physical exertion triggers angina.\\n                \\nAvoid large meals and rich foods that leave you feeling stuffed if heavy meals trigger angina.\\n                \\nTry to avoid situations that make you upset or stressed if emotional stress triggers angina. Learn ways to handle stress that can\\'t be avoided.\\n                \\nYou also can make lifestyle changes that help lower your risk for coronary heart disease. One of the most important changes is to quit smoking. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels and raise your risk for CHD. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.\\n                \\nIf you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.\\n                \\nFor more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index (DCI) Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBIs) \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.\"\\n                \\nFollowing a healthy diet is another important lifestyle change. A healthy diet can prevent or reduce high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol and help you maintain a healthy weight.\\n                \\nA healthy diet includes a variety of fruits and vegetables (including beans and peas). It also includes whole grains, lean meats, poultry without skin, seafood, and fat-free or low-fat milk and dairy products. A healthy diet also is low in sodium (salt), added sugars, solid fats, and refined grains.\\n                \\nFor more information about following a healthy diet, go to the NHLBIs Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH and the U.S. Department of Agricultures ChooseMyPlate.gov Web site. Both resources provide general information about healthy eating.\\n                \\nOther important lifestyle changes include:\\n                \\nBeing physically active. Check with your doctor to find out how much and what kinds of activity are safe for you. For more information, go to the DCI Physical Activity and Your Heart article.\\n                \\nMaintaining a healthy weight. If youre overweight or obese, work with your doctor to create a reasonable weight-loss plan. Controlling your weight helps you control CHD risk factors.\\n                \\nTaking all medicines as your doctor prescribes, especially if you have diabetes.\\n                \\nMedicines\\n                \\nNitrates are the medicines most commonly used to treat angina. They relax and widen blood vessels. This allows more blood to flow to the heart, while reducing the hearts workload.\\n                \\nNitroglycerin (NI-tro-GLIS-er-in) is the most commonly used nitrate for angina. Nitroglycerin that dissolves under your tongue or between your cheek and gum is used to relieve angina episodes.\\n                \\nNitroglycerin pills and skin patches are used to prevent angina episodes. However, pills and skin patches act too slowly to relieve pain during an angina attack.\\n                \\nOther medicines also are used to treat angina, such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, oral antiplatelet medicines, or anticoagulants (blood thinners). These medicines can help:\\n                \\nLower blood pressure and cholesterol levels\\n                \\nSlow the heart rate\\n                \\nRelax blood vessels\\n                \\nReduce strain on the heart\\n                \\nPrevent blood clots from forming\\n                \\nPeople who have stable angina may be advised to get annual flu shots.\\n                \\nMedical Procedures\\n                \\nIf lifestyle changes and medicines don\\'t control angina, you may need a medical procedure to treat the underlying heart disease. Both angioplasty (AN-jee-oh-plas-tee) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are commonly used to treat heart disease.\\n                \\nAngioplasty opens blocked or narrowed coronary arteries. During angioplasty, a thin tube with a balloon or other device on the end is threaded through a blood vessel to the narrowed or blocked coronary artery.\\n                \\nOnce in place, the balloon is inflated to push the plaque outward against the wall of the artery. This widens the artery and restores blood flow.\\n                \\nAngioplasty can improve blood flow to your heart and relieve chest pain. A small mesh tube called a stent usually is placed in the artery to help keep it open after the procedure.\\n                \\nDuring CABG, healthy arteries or veins taken from other areas in your body are used to bypass (that is, go around) your narrowed coronary arteries. Bypass surgery can improve blood flow to your heart, relieve chest pain, and possibly prevent a heart attack.\\n                \\nYou will work with your doctor to decide which treatment is better for you.\\n                \\nCardiac Rehabilitation\\n                \\nYour doctor may recommend cardiac rehab for angina or after angioplasty, CABG, or a heart attack. Cardiac rehab is a medically supervised program that can help improve the health and well-being of people who have heart problems.\\n                \\nThe cardiac rehab team may include doctors, nurses, exercise specialists, physical and occupational therapists, dietitians or nutritionists, and psychologists or other mental health specialists.\\n                \\nRehab has two parts:\\n                \\nExercise training. This part helps you learn how to exercise safely, strengthen your muscles, and improve your stamina. Your exercise plan will be based on your personal abilities, needs, and interests.\\n                \\nEducation, counseling, and training. This part of rehab helps you understand your heart condition and find ways to reduce your risk for future heart problems. The rehab team will help you learn how to adjust to a new lifestyle and deal with your fears about the future.\\n                \\nFor more information about cardiac rehab, go to the DCI Cardiac Rehabilitation article.\\n                \\nEnhanced External Counterpulsation Therapy\\n                \\nEnhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) therapy is helpful for some people who have angina. Large cuffs, similar to blood pressure cuffs, are put on your legs. The cuffs are inflated and deflated in sync with your heartbeat.\\n                \\nEECP therapy improves the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle and helps relieve angina. You typically get 35 1-hour treatments over 7 weeks.']}"}, "time": 1746283465.4580858}
