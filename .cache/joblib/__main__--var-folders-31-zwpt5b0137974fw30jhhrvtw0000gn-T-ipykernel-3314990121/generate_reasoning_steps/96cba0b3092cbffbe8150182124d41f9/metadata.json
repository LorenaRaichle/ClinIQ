Researchers are studying how prolonged exposure to high blood glucose causes nerve damage. Nerve damage is likely due to a combination of factors:\\n                \\n- metabolic factors, such as high blood glucose, long duration of diabetes, abnormal blood fat levels, and possibly low levels of insulin  - neurovascular factors, leading to damage to the blood vessels that carry oxygen and nutrients to nerves  - autoimmune factors that cause inflammation in nerves  - mechanical injury to nerves, such as carpal tunnel syndrome  - inherited traits that increase susceptibility to nerve disease  - lifestyle factors, such as smoking or alcohol use', 'Symptoms depend on the type of neuropathy and which nerves are affected. Some people with nerve damage have no symptoms at all. For others, the first symptom is often numbness, tingling, or pain in the feet. Symptoms are often minor at first, and because most nerve damage occurs over several years, mild cases may go unnoticed for a long time. Symptoms can involve the sensory, motor, and autonomicor involuntarynervous systems. In some people, mainly those with focal neuropathy, the onset of pain may be sudden and severe.\\n                \\nSymptoms of nerve damage may include\\n                \\n- numbness, tingling, or pain in the toes, feet, legs, hands, arms, and fingers  - wasting of the muscles of the feet or hands  - indigestion, nausea, or vomiting  - diarrhea or constipation  - dizziness or faintness due to a drop in blood pressure after standing or sitting up  - problems with urination  - erectile dysfunction in men or vaginal dryness in women  - weakness\\n                \\nSymptoms that are not due to neuropathy, but often accompany it, include weight loss and depression.', 'Diabetic neuropathy can be classified as peripheral, autonomic, proximal, or focal. Each affects different parts of the body in various ways.\\n                \\n- Peripheral neuropathy, the most common type of diabetic neuropathy, causes pain or loss of feeling in the toes, feet, legs, hands, and arms.  - Autonomic neuropathy causes changes in digestion, bowel and bladder function, sexual response, and perspiration. It can also affect the nerves that serve the heart and control blood pressure, as well as nerves in the lungs and eyes. Autonomic neuropathy can also cause hypoglycemia unawareness, a condition in which people no longer experience the warning symptoms of low blood glucose levels.  - Proximal neuropathy causes pain in the thighs, hips, or buttocks and leads to weakness in the legs.  - Focal neuropathy results in the sudden weakness of one nerve or a group of nerves, causing muscle weakness or pain. Any nerve in the body can be affected.\\n                \\n\\n                \\nNeuropathy Affects Nerves Throughout the Body  Peripheral neuropathy affects   - toes   - feet   - legs   - hands   - arms   Autonomic neuropathy affects   - heart and blood vessels   - digestive system   - urinary tract   - sex organs   - sweat glands   - eyes   - lungs   Proximal neuropathy affects   - thighs   - hips   - buttocks   - legs   Focal neuropathy affects   - eyes   - facial muscles   - ears   - pelvis and lower back   - chest   - abdomen   - thighs   - legs   - feet', 'Peripheral neuropathy, also called distal symmetric neuropathy or sensorimotor neuropathy, is nerve damage in the arms and legs. Feet and legs are likely to be affected before hands and arms. Many people with diabetes have signs of neuropathy that a doctor could note but feel no symptoms themselves. Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy may include\\n                \\n- numbness or insensitivity to pain or temperature  - a tingling, burning, or prickling sensation  - sharp pains or cramps  - extreme sensitivity to touch, even light touch  - loss of balance and coordination\\n                \\nThese symptoms are often worse at night.\\n                \\nPeripheral neuropathy may also cause muscle weakness and loss of reflexes, especially at the ankle, leading to changes in the way a person walks. Foot deformities, such as hammertoes and the collapse of the midfoot, may occur. Blisters and sores may appear on numb areas of the foot because pressure or injury goes unnoticed. If an infection occurs and is not treated promptly, the infection may spread to the bone, and the foot may then have to be amputated. Many amputations are preventable if minor problems are caught and treated in time.']}"}, "time": 1746283485.2849889}
