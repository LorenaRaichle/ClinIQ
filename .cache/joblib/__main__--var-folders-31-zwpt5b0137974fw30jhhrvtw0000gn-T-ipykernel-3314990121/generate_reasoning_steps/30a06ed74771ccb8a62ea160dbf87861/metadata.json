It can be associated with a variety of clinical syndromes including invasive sinusitis; nodules or abscesses beneath the skin; keratitis; lung masses; osteomyelitis; mycotic arthritis; endocarditis; brain abscess; and wide-spread infection. Although the condition can affect all people, it is most commonly diagnosed in immunocompetent and immunosuppressed people and can even be life-threatening in these populations. Treatment depends on the signs and symptoms present in each person but may include surgery and/or various medications.', 'Duane syndrome is a disorder of eye movement. This condition prevents outward movement of the eye (toward the ear), and in some cases may also limit inward eye movement (toward the nose). As the eye moves inward, the eyelids partially close and the eyeball pulls back (retracts) into its socket. Usually only one eye is affected. Some people with Duane syndrome develop amblyopia (\"lazy eye\"), a condition that causes vision loss in the affected eye. Most cases occur without other signs and symptoms. There are three forms of Duane syndrome, designated types 1, 2, and 3. The types vary in which eye movements are most severely restricted (inward, outward, or both). All three types are characterized by retraction of the eyeball as the eye moves inward and are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Duane syndrome type 2? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Duane syndrome type 2. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Pheochromocytoma-islet cell tumor syndrome?
