Orthostatic Intolerance is generally associated with lightheadedness and/or fainting that is typically relieved by lying down again. In people with POTS, these symptoms are also accompanied by a rapid increase in heartbeat. Although POTS can affect men and women of all ages, most cases are diagnosed in women between the ages of 15 and 50. The exact underlying cause of POTS is currently unknown. However, episodes often begin after a pregnancy, major surgery, trauma, or a viral illness and may increase right before a menstrual period. Treatment aims to relieve low blood volume and/or regulate circulatory problems that could be causing the condition.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome? Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is primarily characterized by orthostatic intolerance (an excessively reduced volume of blood returns to the heart when moving from a lying down to a standing position). Orthostatic Intolerance is generally associated with lightheadedness and/or fainting that is typically relieved by lying down again. In people with POTS, these symptoms are also accompanied by a rapid increase in heartbeat. Other symptoms reported in POTS include: Visual changes (i.e. blurry vision) Throbbing of the head Poor concentration Tiredness Gastrointestinal symptoms (i.e. nausea, cramps, bloating, constipation, diarrhea) Shortness of breath Head, neck and/or chest discomfort Weakness Sleep disorders Exercise intolerance Sweating Anxiety', 'What causes postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome? The underlying cause of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is poorly understood. However, episodes often begin after a pregnancy, major surgery, trauma, or a viral illness and may increase right before a menstrual period. Many researchers suspect that there may be more than one cause for the condition. The following abnormalities can be associated with POTS and may play a role in the development of the condition: Peripheral denervation - reduced nerve stimulation to certain muscles. The lower extremities are generally most affected in people with POTS. Hypovolemia - an abnormal decrease or redistribution of blood in the body Changes in venous function - more specifically, a reduction in the volume of blood that returns to the heart (venous return) when moving from a lying down to a standing position Cardiovascular deconditioning - changes in cardiovascular function Baroreflex abnormalities - the baroreflexes play an important role in blood pressure regulation. When they sense a change in blood pressure, the heart rate is adjusted and the sympathetic nerve system fibers are activated to cause the blood vessels to narrow. Increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system Although most cases of POTS appear to occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition, some affected people report a family history of orthostatic intolerance (an excessively reduced volume of blood returns to the heart when moving from a lying down to a standing position). This suggests that genetic factors may play a role in the development of POTS in some cases. Some studies also suggest that polymorphisms in certain genes (NOS3, ADRB2) may be associated with an increased risk of developing the condition and a change (mutation) in the norepinephrine transporter gene (SLC6A2) has been identified in one family with POTS.', 'Is postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome inherited? Most cases of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) are not thought to be inherited. Although the condition generally occurs sporadically, some people with POTS do report a family history of orthostatic intolerance (an excessively reduced volume of blood returns to the heart when moving from a lying down to a standing position). This suggests that inherited factors may play a role in the development of POTS in some families.']}"}, "time": 1746283460.180084}
