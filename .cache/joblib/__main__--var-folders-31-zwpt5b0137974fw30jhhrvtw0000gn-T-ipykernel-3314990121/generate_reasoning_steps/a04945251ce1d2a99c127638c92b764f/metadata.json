Aging can weaken the heart muscle. Older people also may have had diseases for many years that led to heart failure. African Americans are more likely to have heart failure than people of other races. They're also more likely to have symptoms at a younger age, have more hospital visits due to heart failure, and die from heart failure. Excess weight puts strain on the heart. Being overweight also increases your risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. These diseases can lead to heart failure. A history of a heart attack puts people at greater risk for heart failure. Men have a higher rate of heart failure than women.\", 'Ways to prevent heart failure include - keeping your cholesterol and blood pressure levels healthy  - keeping diabetes in check   - maintaining a healthy weight   - quitting smoking   - following a heart healthy diet  - limiting the amount of alcohol you drink   - eating a diet low in salt because salt can cause extra fluid to build up in your body and also contribute to high blood pressure. Older adults should limit their sodium (salt) intake to1500 mg a day (about 2/3 tsp of salt).   - getting regular exercise. Aim for at least 30 minutes a day of exercise. Check with your doctor before starting any exercise program.

Your goal for LDL, or \"bad,\" cholesterol depends on how many other risk factors you have. Here are recommended LDL cholesterol goals. - If you don\\'t have coronary heart disease or diabetes and have one or no risk factors, your LDL goal is less than 160 mg/dL.   - If you don\\'t have coronary heart disease or diabetes and have two or more risk factors, your LDL goal is less than 130 mg/dL.  - If you do have coronary heart disease or diabetes, your LDL goal is less than 100 mg/dL. If you don\\'t have coronary heart disease or diabetes and have one or no risk factors, your LDL goal is less than 160 mg/dL. If you don\\'t have coronary heart disease or diabetes and have two or more risk factors, your LDL goal is less than 130 mg/dL. If you do have coronary heart disease or diabetes, your LDL goal is less than 100 mg/dL. The goal for HDL, or \"good,\" cholesterol is above 40 in men and above 50 in women. The goal for triglycerides, another fat in the blood, is below 150.', 'There is not one specific test to diagnose heart failure. Because the symptoms are common for other conditions, your doctor will determine if you have heart failure by doing a detailed medical history, an examination, and several tests. During a physical exam, a doctor will listen for abnormal heart sounds and lung sounds that indicate fluid buildup, as well as look for signs of swelling. If there are signs of heart failure, the doctor may order several tests, including: - an EKG, or electrocardiogram, to measure the rate and regularity of the heartbeat  - a chest X-ray to evaluate the heart and lungs  - a BNP blood test to measure the level of a hormone called BNP that increases when heart failure is present. an EKG, or electrocardiogram, to measure the rate and regularity of the heartbeat a chest X-ray to evaluate the heart and lungs a BNP blood test to measure the level of a hormone called BNP that increases when heart failure is present.']}"}, "time": 1746283468.7109618}
