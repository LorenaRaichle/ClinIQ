Obese and overweight mean that your weight is greater than it should be for your health. Underweight means that it is lower than it should be for your health. Your healthy body weight depends on your sex and height. For children, it also depends on your age.    A sudden, unexpected change in weight can be a sign of a medical problem. Causes for sudden weight loss can include       - Thyroid problems    - Cancer    - Infectious diseases    - Digestive diseases    - Certain medicines       Sudden weight gain can be due to medicines, thyroid problems, heart failure, and kidney disease.    Good nutrition and exercise can help in losing weight. Eating extra calories within a well-balanced diet and treating any underlying medical problems can help to add weight.', 'Summary : Your blood contains red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC), and platelets. Blood count tests measure the number and types of cells in your blood. This helps doctors check on your overall health. The tests can also help to diagnose diseases and conditions such as anemia, infections, clotting problems, blood cancers, and immune system disorders.    Specific types include tests for       - RBC - the numbers, size, and types of RBC in the blood    - WBC - the numbers and types of WBC in the blood    - Platelets - the numbers and size of the platelets    - Hemoglobin - an iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen    - Hematocrit - how much space red blood cells take up in your blood    - Reticulocyte count - how many young red blood cells are in your blood    - Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) - the average size of your red blood cells       The complete blood count (CBC) includes most or all of these. The CBC is one of the most common blood tests.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Summary : Organ donation takes healthy organs and tissues from one person for transplantation into another. Experts say that the organs from one donor can save or help as many as 50 people. Organs you can donate include       - Internal organs: Kidneys, heart, liver, pancreas, intestines, lungs     - Skin     - Bone and bone marrow     - Cornea       Most organ and tissue donations occur after the donor has died. But some organs and tissues can be donated while the donor is alive.    People of all ages and background can be organ donors. If you are under age 18, your parent or guardian must give you permission to become a donor. If you are 18 or older you can show you want to be a donor by signing a donor card. You should also let your family know your wishes.    Health Resources and Services Administration', \"Summary : Stem cells are cells with the potential to develop into many different types of cells in the body. They serve as a repair system for the body. There are two main types of stem cells: embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells.     Stem cells are different from other cells in the body in three ways:       - They can divide and renew themselves over a long time    - They are unspecialized, so they cannot do specific functions in the body    - They have the potential to become specialized cells, such as muscle cells, blood cells, and brain cells       Doctors and scientists are excited about stem cells because they could help in many different areas of health and medical research. Studying stem cells may help explain how serious conditions such as birth defects and cancer come about. Stem cells may one day be used to make cells and tissues for therapy of many diseases. Examples include Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, spinal cord injury, heart disease, diabetes, and arthritis.    NIH: National Institutes of Health\"]}"}, "time": 1746283467.0663471}
