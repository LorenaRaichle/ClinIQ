What tests aid in the diagnosis of progressive bulbar palsy? Progressive bulbar palsy is a difficult to diagnose condition. No one test or procedure offers a definitive diagnosis. Diagnosis is largely based upon the person's symptoms, tests that show how well their nerves are working (e.g., an EMG or electromyography), and ruling out other causes for the symptoms. Particularly, stroke and a condition called myasthenia gravis, may have certain symptoms that are similar to those of progressive bulbar palsy and must be ruled out prior to diagnosing this disorder. Testing for acetylcholine receptor-binding antibodies may be helpful in ruling out myasthenia gravis. Because of the lack of definitive tests, you may find it helpful to consult with a doctor who is experienced in diagnosing ALS. The ALS Association lists experts and specialty centers through their Web site at: http://www.alsa.org/community/als-clinics\", 'How is progressive bulbar palsy treated? Treatments aim to help people cope with the symptoms of progressive bulbar palsy, such as feeding tubes, devices to help with talking, and medicines to treat muscle spasms, weakness, drooling, sleep problems, pain, and depression. The Robert Packard Center for ALS Research at John Hopkins offers further general information on treatment: http://www.alscenter.org/living_with_als/treatment.html The Mayo Clinic provides information on treatment of ALS in general, which may be helpful: http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/basics/treatment/con-20024397 If you are interested in learning about clinical trials, we recommend that you call the Patient Recruitment and Public Liaison (PRPL) Office at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) at 1-800-411-1222. Organizations, such as the ALS Association and Muscular Dystrophy Association are great sources for information on clinical trial opportunities and research. You can find information about participating in a clinical trial as well as learn about resources for travel and lodging assistance, through the Get Involved in Research section of our Web site.', 'Kawasaki syndrome is a condition that involves inflammation of the blood vessels. It is typically diagnosed in young children, but older children and adults can also develop this condition. Kawasaki syndrome often begins with a fever that lasts at least 5 days. Other classic symptoms may include red eyes, lips, and mouth; rash; swollen and red hands and feet; and swollen lymph nodes. Sometimes the condition affects the coronary arteries (which carry oxygen-rich blood to the heart). This can lead to serious heart problems. Kawasaki syndrome occurs most often in people of Asian and Pacific Island descent. The cause of Kawasaki disease is unknown. An infection along with genetic factors may be involved. Treatment includes intravenous gamma globulin and high doses of aspirin in a hospital setting.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Kawasaki syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Kawasaki syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Cheilitis 90% Glossitis 90% Inflammatory abnormality of the eye 90% Lymphadenopathy 90% Proteinuria 90% Recurrent pharyngitis 90% Skin rash 90% Vasculitis 90% Abdominal pain 50% Abnormality of nail color 50% Abnormality of temperature regulation 50% Abnormality of the heart valves 50% Abnormality of the pericardium 50% Arthritis 50% Diarrhea 50% Dry skin 50% Edema 50% Leukocytosis 50% Abnormality of the myocardium 7.5% Arrhythmia 7.5% Arthralgia 7.5% Aseptic leukocyturia 7.5% Behavioral abnormality 7.5% Biliary tract abnormality 7.5% Congestive heart failure 7.5% Coronary artery disease 7.5% Cranial nerve paralysis 7.5% Dilatation of the ascending aorta 7.5% Meningitis 7.5% Migraine 7.5% Nausea and vomiting 7.5% Ptosis 7.5% Restrictive lung disease 7.5% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.']}"}, "time": 1746283459.870739}
