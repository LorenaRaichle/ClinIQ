Back injuries can result from sports injuries, work around the house or in the garden, or a sudden jolt such as a car accident. The lower back is the most common site of back injuries and back pain. Common back injuries include        - Sprains and strains     -  Herniated disks    -  Fractured vertebrae       These injuries can cause pain and limit your movement. Treatments vary but might include medicines, icing, bed rest, physical therapy, or surgery. You might be able to prevent some back injuries by maintaining a healthy weight, lifting objects with your legs, and using lower-back support when you sit.', 'A phobia is a type of anxiety disorder. It is a strong, irrational fear of something that poses little or no real danger.    There are many specific phobias. Acrophobia is a fear of heights. Agoraphobia is a fear of public places, and claustrophobia is a fear of closed-in places. If you become anxious and extremely self-conscious in everyday social situations, you could have a social phobia. Other common phobias involve tunnels, highway driving, water, flying, animals and blood.     People with phobias try to avoid what they are afraid of. If they cannot, they may experience       - Panic and fear    - Rapid heartbeat    - Shortness of breath    - Trembling    - A strong desire to get away       Phobias usually start in children or teens, and continue into adulthood. The causes of specific phobias are not known, but they sometimes run in families.     Treatment helps most people with phobias. Options include medicines, therapy or both.    NIH: National Institute of Mental Health', \"Summary : You've probably seen your chart at your doctor's office. In fact, you may have charts at several doctors' offices. If you've been in the hospital, you have a chart there, too. These charts are your medical records. They may be on paper or electronic. To keep track of all this information, it's a good idea to keep your own personal health record.     What kind of information would you put in a personal health record? You could start with       -  Your name, birth date, blood type, and emergency contact information    -  Date of last physical    -  Dates and results of tests and screenings    -  Major illnesses and surgeries, with dates    -  A list of your medicines and supplements, the dosages, and how long you've taken them    -  Any allergies    -  Any chronic diseases    -  Any history of illnesses in your family\", \"Summary : Assisted reproductive technology (ART) is used to treat infertility. It includes fertility treatments that handle both a woman's egg and a man's sperm. It works by removing eggs from a woman's body. The eggs are then mixed with sperm to make embryos. The embryos are then put back in the woman's body. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is the most common and effective type of ART.     ART procedures sometimes use donor eggs, donor sperm, or previously frozen embryos. It may also involve a surrogate or gestational carrier. A surrogate is a woman who becomes pregnant with sperm from the male partner of the couple. A gestational carrier becomes pregnant with an egg from the female partner and the sperm from the male partner.     The most common complication of ART is a multiple pregnancy. It can be prevented or minimized by limiting the number of embryos that are put into the woman's body.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283466.933368}
