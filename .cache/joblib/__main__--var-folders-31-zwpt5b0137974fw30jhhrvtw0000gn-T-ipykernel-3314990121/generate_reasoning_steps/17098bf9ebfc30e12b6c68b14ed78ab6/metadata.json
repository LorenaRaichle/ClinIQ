The goal of treatment is to control the symptoms and prevent secondary infections. Mild cases of guttate psoriasis are usually treated at home. The following may be recommended: Cortisone (anti-itch and anti-inflammatory) cream Dandruff shampoos (over-the-counter or prescription) Lotions that contain coal tar Moisturizers Prescription medicines containing vitamin D or vitamin A (retinoids) People with very severe guttate psoriasis may take medicines to suppress the body's immune system. These medicines include corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and methotrexate. Sunlight may help some symptoms go away. Care should be taken to avoid sunburn. Some people may choose to have phototherapy. Phototherapy is a medical procedure in which the skin is carefully exposed to ultraviolet light. Phototherapy may be given alone or after taking a drug that makes the skin more sensitive to light. More detailed information related to the treatment of psoriasis can be accessed through Medscape Reference. The National Psoriasis Foundation can also provide you with information on treatment.\", 'Neuroferritinopathy is a movement disorder caused by the gradual accumulation of iron in the basal ganglia of the brain. People with neuroferritinopathy have progressive problems with movement that begin at about age 40. These movement problems can include involuntary jerking motions (chorea), rhythmic shaking (tremor), difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), or uncontrolled tensing of muscles (dystonia). Symptoms of the disorder may be more prominent on one side of the body. Affected individuals may also have difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) and speaking (dysarthria). Intelligence is generally unaffected, but some individuals develop a gradual decline in thinking and reasoning abilities (dementia). Personality changes such as reduced inhibitions and difficulty controlling emotions may also occur as the disorder progresses. Neuroferritinopathy is caused by mutations in the FTL gene. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.', \"What are the signs and symptoms of Neuroferritinopathy? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Neuroferritinopathy. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Chorea 90% Hypertonia 90% Incoordination 90% Abnormality of eye movement 50% Feeding difficulties in infancy 50% Gait disturbance 50% Constipation 7.5% Developmental regression 7.5% Hypotension 7.5% Neurological speech impairment 7.5% Reduced consciousness/confusion 7.5% Tremor 7.5% Anarthria - Ataxia - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Babinski sign - Blepharospasm - Bradykinesia - Cavitation of the basal ganglia - Choreoathetosis - Decreased serum ferritin - Dementia - Disinhibition - Dysarthria - Dysphagia - Emotional lability - Hyperreflexia - Laryngeal dystonia - Mutism - Neurodegeneration - Parkinsonism - Phenotypic variability - Progressive - Rigidity - Spasticity - Writer's cramp - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.\", 'Neurocutaneous melanosis (NCM) is a rare, non-inherited condition of the central nervous system. It is characterized by melanocytic nevi in both the skin and the brain. Two-thirds of people with NCM have giant congenital melanocytic nevi, and the remaining one-third have numerous lesions but no giant lesions. Most patients present with neurological features early in life, which can be secondary to intracranial hemorrhages (bleeding in the brain), impairment of cerebrospinal fluid circulation (fluid around the brain and spinal cord), and/or malignant transformation of the melanocytes. The prognosis of patients with symptomatic neurocutaneous melanosis is extremely poor, even in the absence of malignancy. Chemotherapy has been ineffective in the few patients in whom it has been tried.']}"}, "time": 1746283456.279202}
