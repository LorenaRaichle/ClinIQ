These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are involved in muscle maintenance and repair.  Some of the proteins produced from these genes assemble with other proteins into larger protein complexes. These complexes maintain the physical integrity of muscle tissue and allow the muscles to contract. Other proteins participate in cell signaling, cell membrane repair, or the removal of potentially toxic wastes from muscle cells.  Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy is classified based on its inheritance pattern and genetic cause. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1 includes forms of the disorder that have an inheritance pattern called autosomal dominant. Mutations in the LMNA gene cause limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1B. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1C is one of a group of muscle disorders called caveolinopathies caused by mutations in the CAV3 gene.  Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2 includes forms of the disorder that have an inheritance pattern called autosomal recessive. Calpainopathy, or limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A, is caused by mutations in the CAPN3 gene. Type 2A is the most common form of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, accounting for about 30 percent of cases. Dysferlinopathy, also called limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B, is caused by mutations in the DYSF gene.  Sarcoglycanopathies are forms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy caused by mutations in the SGCA, SGCB, SGCG, and SGCD genes. These sarcoglycanopathies are known as limb-girdle muscular dystrophy types 2D, 2E, 2C, and 2F respectively.  A TTN gene mutation causes limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2J, which has been identified only in the Finnish population. Mutations in the ANO5 gene cause limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2L. Mutations in several other genes cause forms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy called dystroglycanopathies, including limb-girdle muscular dystrophy types 2I, 2K, 2M, and 2N.  Other rare forms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy are caused by mutations in several other genes, some of which have not been identified.', 'Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy can have different inheritance patterns.  Most forms of this condition are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.  Several rare forms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.', 'These resources address the diagnosis or management of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy:  - Cleveland Clinic  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Overview  - Genetic Testing Registry: Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy  - Genetic Testing Registry: Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, type 1A  - Genetic Testing Registry: Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, type 1B  - Genetic Testing Registry: Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, type 1C  - Genetic Testing Registry: Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, type 1E  - Genetic Testing Registry: Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, type 1F  - Genetic Testing Registry: Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, type 1G  - Genetic Testing Registry: Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, type 1H  - Genetic Testing Registry: Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, type 2A  - Genetic Testing Registry: Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, type 2B  - Genetic Testing Registry: Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, type 2D  - Genetic Testing Registry: Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, type 2E  - Genetic Testing Registry: Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, type 2F  - Genetic Testing Registry: Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, type 2G  - Genetic Testing Registry: Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, type 2J  - Genetic Testing Registry: Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, type 2L  - Genetic Testing Registry: Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy, type C1  - Genetic Testing Registry: Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy, type C2  - Genetic Testing Registry: Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy, type C3  - Genetic Testing Registry: Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy, type C4  - Genetic Testing Registry: Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy, type C5  - Johns Hopkins Medicine  - LGMD-Diagnosis.org   These resources from MedlinePlus offer information about the diagnosis and management of various health conditions:  - Diagnostic Tests  - Drug Therapy  - Surgery and Rehabilitation  - Genetic Counseling   - Palliative Care', 'CASK-related intellectual disability is a disorder of brain development that has two main forms: microcephaly with pontine and cerebellar hypoplasia (MICPCH), and X-linked intellectual disability (XL-ID) with or without nystagmus. Within each of these forms, males typically have more severe signs and symptoms than do females; the more severe MICPCH mostly affects females, likely because only a small number of males survive to birth.  People with MICPCH often have an unusually small head at birth, and the head does not grow at the same rate as the rest of the body, so it appears that the head is getting smaller as the body grows (progressive microcephaly). Individuals with this condition have underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of areas of the brain called the cerebellum and the pons. The cerebellum is the part of the brain that coordinates movement. The pons is located at the base of the brain in an area called the brainstem, where it transmits signals from the cerebellum to the rest of the brain.  Individuals with MICPCH have intellectual disability that is usually severe. They may have sleep disturbances and exhibit self-biting, hand flapping, or other abnormal repetitive behaviors. Seizures are also common in this form of the disorder.  People with MICPCH do not usually develop language skills, and most do not learn to walk. They have hearing loss caused by nerve problems in the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss), and most also have abnormalities affecting the eyes. These abnormalities include underdevelopment of the nerves that carry information from the eyes to the brain (optic nerve hypoplasia), breakdown of the light-sensing tissue at the back of the eyes (retinopathy), and eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus). Characteristic facial features may include arched eyebrows; a short, broad nose; a lengthened area between the nose and mouth (philtrum); a protruding upper jaw (maxilla); a short chin; and large ears.  Individuals with MICPCH may have weak muscle tone (hypotonia) in the torso along with increased muscle tone (hypertonia) and stiffness (spasticity) in the limbs. Movement problems such as involuntary tensing of various muscles (dystonia) may also occur in this form of the disorder.  XL-ID with or without nystagmus (rapid, involuntary eye movements) is a milder form of CASK-related intellectual disability. The intellectual disability in this form of the disorder can range from mild to severe; some affected females have normal intelligence. About half of affected individuals have nystagmus. Seizures and rhythmic shaking (tremors) may also occur in this form.']}"}, "time": 1746283448.5181031}
