A child with kidney dysplasia in both kidneys      - is more likely to develop chronic kidney disease (CKD)    - needs close follow-up with a pediatric nephrologist    - may eventually need dialysis or a kidney transplant', 'Mineral and bone disorder in CKD occurs when damaged kidneys and abnormal hormone levels cause calcium and phosphorus levels in a persons blood to be out of balance. Mineral and bone disorder commonly occurs in people with CKD and affects most people with kidney failure receiving dialysis.\\n                \\nIn the past, health care providers used the term renal osteodystrophy to describe mineral and hormone disturbances caused by kidney disease. Today, renal osteodystrophy only describes bone problems that result from mineral and bone disorder in CKD. Health care providers might use the phrase chronic kidney disease mineral and bone disorder, or CKD-MBD, to describe the condition that affects the bones, heart, and blood vessels.']}"}, "time": 1746283485.3271081}
