Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. Before starting treatment, patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Choosing the most appropriate cancer treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient, family, and health care team.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Three types of standard treatment are used:\\n                    Surgery    The doctor may remove the cancer using one of the following operations:            -  Dilatation and curettage (D&C) with suction evacuation: A surgical procedure to remove abnormal tissue and parts of the inner lining of the uterus. The cervix is dilated and the material inside the uterus is removed with a small vacuum-like device. The walls of the uterus are then gently scraped with a curette (spoon-shaped instrument) to remove any material that may remain in the uterus. This procedure may be used for molar pregnancies.     -  Hysterectomy: Surgery to remove the uterus, and sometimes the cervix. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through the vagina, the operation is called a vaginal hysterectomy. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a large incision (cut) in the abdomen, the operation is called a total abdominal hysterectomy. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a small incision (cut) in the abdomen using a laparoscope, the operation is called a total laparoscopic hysterectomy.              Chemotherapy      Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated, or whether the tumor is low-risk or high-risk.     Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug.    Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy after surgery to kill any tumor cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.    See Drugs Approved for Gestational Trophoblastic Disease for more information.       Radiation therapy      Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of gestational trophoblastic disease being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat gestational trophoblastic disease.\\n                \\n                \\n                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\\n                    Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI website.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\\n                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\\n                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Follow-up tests may be needed.\\n                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.    Blood levels of beta human chorionic gonadotropin (-hCG) will be checked for up to 6 months after treatment has ended. This is because a -hCG level that is higher than normal may mean that the tumor has not responded to treatment or it has become cancer.\\n                \\n\\t\\t        \\n\\t\\t            Treatment Options for Gestational Trophoblastic Disease\\n\\t\\t            \\n\\t\\t                \\n\\t\\t                    Hydatidiform Moles\\n\\t\\t                    Treatment of a hydatidiform mole may include the following:         -  Surgery (Dilatation and curettage with suction evacuation) to remove the tumor.        After surgery, beta human chorionic gonadotropin (-hCG) blood tests are done every week until the -hCG level returns to normal. Patients also have follow-up doctor visits monthly for up to 6 months. If the level of -hCG does not return to normal or increases, it may mean the hydatidiform mole was not completely removed and it has become cancer. Pregnancy causes -hCG levels to increase, so your doctor will ask you not to become pregnant until follow-up is finished.   For disease that remains after surgery, treatment is usually chemotherapy.   Check the list of NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with hydatidiform mole.

The immune system protects the body from foreign substances, infection, and diseases. The lymph system is made up of the following:         -  Lymph: Colorless, watery fluid that carries white blood cells called lymphocytes through the lymph system. Lymphocytes protect the body against infections and the growth of tumors.    -  Lymph vessels: A network of thin tubes that collect lymph from different parts of the body and return it to the bloodstream.     -  Lymph nodes: Small, bean-shaped structures that filter lymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease. Lymph nodes are located along the network of lymph vessels found throughout the body. Clusters of lymph nodes are found in the neck, underarm, abdomen, pelvis, and groin.    -  Spleen: An organ that makes lymphocytes, filters the blood, stores blood cells, and destroys old blood cells. The spleen is on the left side of the abdomen near the stomach.    -  Thymus: An organ in which lymphocytes grow and multiply. The thymus is in the chest behind the breastbone.    -  Tonsils: Two small masses of lymph tissue at the back of the throat. The tonsils make lymphocytes.    -  Bone marrow: The soft, spongy tissue in the center of large bones. Bone marrow makes white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.         Lymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body such as the stomach, thyroid gland, brain, and skin.   There are two general types of lymphoma: Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. (See the PDQ summary on Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment for more information.)     Hodgkin lymphoma often occurs in adolescents 15 to 19 years of age. The treatment for children and adolescents is different than treatment for adults. (See the PDQ summary on Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment for more information.)\\n                \\n                \\n                    There are two types of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma.\\n                    The two types of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma are:         -  Classical Hodgkin lymphoma.    -  Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma.        Classical Hodgkin lymphoma is divided into four subtypes, based on how the cancer cells look under a microscope:         - Lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin lymphoma.     - Nodular sclerosis Hodgkin lymphoma.     - Mixed cellularity Hodgkin lymphoma.     - Lymphocyte-depleted Hodgkin lymphoma.\", 'Epstein-Barr virus infection increases the risk of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your childs doctor if you think your child may be at risk.    Risk factors for childhood Hodgkin lymphoma include the following:          - Being infected with the Epstein-Barr virus.    - Being infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).    - Having certain diseases of the immune system.    - Having a personal history of mononucleosis (\"mono\").    - Having a parent or sibling with a personal history of Hodgkin lymphoma.        Being exposed to common infections in early childhood may decrease the risk of Hodgkin lymphoma in children because of the effect it has on the immune system.']}"}, "time": 1746283464.4502242}
