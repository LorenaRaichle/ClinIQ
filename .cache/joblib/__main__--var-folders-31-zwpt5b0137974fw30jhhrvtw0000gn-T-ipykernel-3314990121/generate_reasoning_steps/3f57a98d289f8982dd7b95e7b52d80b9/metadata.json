The most important recommendations given to persons with this disease are to\\n                \\n- reduce their weight (if obese or overweight)  - follow a balanced and healthy diet  - increase physical activity  - avoid alcohol  - avoid unnecessary medications\\n                \\nThese are standard recommendations, but they can make a difference. They are also helpful for other conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, and high cholesterol.\\n                \\nA major attempt should be made to lower body weight into the healthy range. Weight loss can improve liver tests in patients with NASH and may reverse the disease to some extent. Research at present is focusing on how much weight loss improves the liver in patients with NASH and whether this improvement lasts over a period of time.\\n                \\nPeople with NASH often have other medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or elevated cholesterol. These conditions should be treated with medication and adequately controlled; having NASH or elevated liver enzymes should not lead people to avoid treating these other conditions.\\n                \\nExperimental approaches under evaluation in patients with NASH include antioxidants, such as vitamin E, selenium, and betaine. These medications act by reducing the oxidative stress that appears to increase inside the liver in patients with NASH. Whether these substances actually help treat the disease is not known, but the results of clinical trials should become available in the next few years.\\n                \\nAnother experimental approach to treating NASH is the use of newer antidiabetic medicationseven in persons without diabetes. Most patients with NASH have insulin resistance, meaning that the insulin normally present in the bloodstream is less effective for them in controlling blood glucose and fatty acids in the blood than it is for people who do not have NASH. The newer antidiabetic medications make the body more sensitive to insulin and may help reduce liver injury in patients with NASH. Studies of these medicationsincluding metformin, rosiglitazone, and pioglitazoneare being sponsored by the National Institutes of Health and should answer the question of whether these medications are beneficial in NASH.', '- Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is fat in the liver, with inflammation and damage.  - NASH occurs in people who drink little or no alcohol and affects 2 to 5 percent of Americans, especially people who are middle-aged and overweight or obese.  - NASH can occur in children.  - People who have NASH may feel well and may not know that they have a liver disease.  - NASH can lead to cirrhosis, a condition in which the liver is permanently damaged and cannot work properly.  - Fatigue can occur at any stage of NASH.  - Weight loss and weakness may begin once the disease is advanced or cirrhosis is present.  - NASH may be suspected if blood tests show high levels of liver enzymes or if scans show fatty liver.  - NASH is diagnosed by examining a small piece of the liver taken through a needle, a procedure called biopsy.  - People who have NASH should reduce their weight, eat a balanced diet, engage in physical activity, and avoid alcohol and unnecessary medications.  - No specific therapies for NASH exist. Experimental therapies being studied include antioxidants and antidiabetes medications.', \"Cushing's syndrome is a hormonal disorder caused by prolonged exposure of the body's tissues to high levels of the hormone cortisol. Sometimes called hypercortisolism, Cushing's syndrome is relatively rare and most commonly affects adults aged 20 to 50. People who are obese and have type 2 diabetes, along with poorly controlled blood glucose-also called blood sugar-and high blood pressure, have an increased risk of developing the disorder.\", \"Signs and symptoms of Cushing's syndrome vary, but most people with the disorder have upper body obesity, a rounded face, increased fat around the neck, and relatively slender arms and legs. Children tend to be obese with slowed growth rates.\\n                \\nOther signs appear in the skin, which becomes fragile and thin, bruises easily, and heals poorly. Purple or pink stretch marks may appear on the abdomen, thighs, buttocks, arms, and breasts. The bones are weakened, and routine activities such as bending, lifting, or rising from a chair may lead to backaches and rib or spinal column fractures.\\n                \\nWomen with Cushing's syndrome usually have excess hair growth on their face, neck, chest, abdomen, and thighs. Their menstrual periods may become irregular or stop. Men may have decreased fertility with diminished or absent desire for sex and, sometimes, erectile dysfunction.\\n                \\nOther common signs and symptoms include\\n                \\n- severe fatigue  - weak muscles  - high blood pressure  - high blood glucose  - increased thirst and urination  - irritability, anxiety, or depression  - a fatty hump between the shoulders\\n                \\nSometimes other conditions have many of the same signs as Cushing's syndrome, even though people with these disorders do not have abnormally elevated cortisol levels. For example, polycystic ovary syndrome can cause menstrual disturbances, weight gain beginning in adolescence, excess hair growth, and impaired insulin action and diabetes. Metabolic syndrome-a combination of problems that includes excess weight around the waist, high blood pressure, abnormal levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood, and insulin resistance-also mimics the symptoms of Cushing's syndrome.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283484.347798}
