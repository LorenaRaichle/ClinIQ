Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Cone-rod dystrophy amelogenesis imperfecta?

This birth defect can occur as an isolated condition or in combination with other abnormalities. The effects of agenesis of the corpus callosum range from subtle or mild to severe, depending on associated brain abnormalities. Treatment usually involves management of symptoms and seizures if they occur.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Isolated corpus callosum agenesis?
