Unlike the genetic forms of epidermolysis bullosa, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) is considered an acquired, sporadic disease. This means that it generally occurs in people with no history of the condition in their families. There have been a couple of reports of families with more than one affected person, suggesting a genetic component may be involved. This could mean that EBA may develop in a person who is \"genetically susceptible.\" However, the condition is not thought to be due to any specific gene(s).', 'How might epidermolysis bullosa acquisita be treated?', \"Werner's syndrome is a disease chiefly characterized by premature aging and cancer predisposition. Development is typically normal until the end of the first decade; the first sign is the lack of a growth spurt during puberty. Early signs (usually in the 20s) include loss and graying of hair, hoarseness, and scleroderma-like skin changes, followed by cataracts, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypogonadism, skin ulcers, and osteoporosis in the 30s. Myocardial infarction (heart attack) and cancer are the most common causes of death, which typically occurs in the late 40s. It is caused by mutations in the WRN gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Management focuses on treatment of signs and symptoms and prevention of secondary complications.\", \"What are the signs and symptoms of Werner's syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Werner's syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal hair quantity 90% Abnormal hair whorl 90% Abnormality of the thorax 90% Cataract 90% Convex nasal ridge 90% Lipoatrophy 90% Pili torti 90% Prematurely aged appearance 90% Short stature 90% White forelock 90% Abnormality of retinal pigmentation 50% Abnormality of the pulmonary artery 50% Abnormality of the testis 50% Abnormality of the voice 50% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the skin 50% Chondrocalcinosis 50% Congestive heart failure 50% Coronary artery disease 50% Decreased fertility 50% Diabetes mellitus 50% Hyperkeratosis 50% Increased bone mineral density 50% Lack of skin elasticity 50% Narrow face 50% Reduced bone mineral density 50% Rocker bottom foot 50% Short palm 50% Skeletal muscle atrophy 50% Skin ulcer 50% Telangiectasia of the skin 50% Abnormality of the cerebral vasculature 7.5% Hypertension 7.5% Laryngomalacia 7.5% Limitation of joint mobility 7.5% Meningioma 7.5% Neoplasm of the breast 7.5% Neoplasm of the lung 7.5% Neoplasm of the oral cavity 7.5% Neoplasm of the skin 7.5% Neoplasm of the small intestine 7.5% Neoplasm of the thyroid gland 7.5% Ovarian neoplasm 7.5% Renal neoplasm 7.5% Secondary amenorrhea 7.5% Abnormality of the hair - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Hypogonadism - Osteoporosis - Osteosarcoma - Premature arteriosclerosis - Progeroid facial appearance - Retinal degeneration - Subcutaneous calcification - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283459.959855}
