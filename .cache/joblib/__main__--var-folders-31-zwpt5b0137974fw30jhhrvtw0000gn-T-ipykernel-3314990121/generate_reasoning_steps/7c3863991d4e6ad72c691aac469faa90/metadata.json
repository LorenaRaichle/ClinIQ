These factors change the shape or flexibility of once-normal heart valves.\\n                \\nThe cause of congenital heart valve disease isnt known. It occurs before birth as the heart is forming. Congenital heart valve disease can occur alone or with other types of congenital heartdefects.\\n                \\nHeart Conditions and Other Disorders\\n                \\nCertain conditions can stretch and distort the heart valves. These conditions include:\\n                \\nAdvanced high blood pressure and heart failure, thiscan enlarge the heart or the main arteries.\\n                \\nAtherosclerosis in the aorta. Atherosclerosis is a condition in which a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside the arteries. The aorta is the main artery that carries oxygen-rich blood to the body.\\n                \\nDamage and scar tissue due to a heart attack or injury to the heart.\\n                \\nRheumatic Fever\\n                \\nUntreated strep throat or other infections with strep bacteria that progress to rheumatic fever can cause heart valve disease.\\n                \\nWhen the body tries to fight the strep infection, one or more heart valves may be damaged or scarred in the process. The aortic and mitral valves most often are affected. Symptoms of heart valve damage often dont appear until many years after recovery from rheumatic fever.\\n                \\nToday, most people who have strep infections are treated with antibiotics before rheumatic fever occurs. If you have strep throat, take all of the antibiotics your doctor prescribes, even if you feel better before the medicine is gone.\\n                \\nHeart valve disease caused by rheumatic fever mainly affects older adults who had strep infections before antibiotics were available. It also affects people from developing countries, where rheumatic fever is more common.\\n                \\nInfections\\n                \\nCommon germs that enter the bloodstream and get carried to the heart can sometimes infect the inner surface of the heart, including the heart valves. This rare but serious infection is called infective endocarditis.\\n                \\nThe germs can enter the bloodstream through needles, syringes, or other medical devices and through breaks in the skin or gums. Often, the bodys defenses fight off the germs and no infection occurs. Sometimes these defenses fail, which leads to infective endocarditis.\\n                \\nInfective endocarditis can develop in people who already have abnormal blood flow through a heart valve as the result of congenital or acquired heart valve disease. The abnormal blood flow causes blood clots to form on the surface of the valve. The blood clots make it easier for germs to attach to and infect the valve.\\n                \\nInfective endocarditis can worsen existing heart valve disease.\\n                \\nOther Conditions and Factors Linked to Heart Valve Disease\\n                \\nMany other conditions and factors are linked to heart valve disease. However, the role they play in causing heart valve disease often isnt clear.\\n                \\nAutoimmune disorders. Autoimmune disorders, such as lupus, can affect the aortic and mitral valves.\\n                \\nCarcinoid syndrome. Tumors in the digestive tract that spread to the liver or lymph nodes can affect the tricuspid and pulmonary valves.\\n                \\nDiet medicines. The use of fenfluramine and phentermine (fen-phen) sometimes has been linked to heart valve problems. These problems typically stabilize or improve after the medicine is stopped.\\n                \\nMarfan syndrome. Congenital disorders, such as Marfan syndrome and other connective tissue disorders, can affect the heart valves.\\n                \\nMetabolic disorders. Relatively uncommon diseases (such as Fabry disease) and other metabolic disorders (such as high blood cholesterol) can affect the heart valves.\\n                \\nRadiation therapy. Radiation therapy to the chest area can cause heart valve disease. This therapy is used to treat cancer. Heart valve disease due to radiation therapy may not cause symptoms until years after the therapy.', \"Older age is a risk factor for heart valve disease. As you age, your heart valves thicken and become stiffer. Also, people are living longer now than in the past. As a result, heart valve disease has become an increasing problem.\\n                \\nPeople who have a history of infective endocarditis (IE), rheumatic fever, heart attack, or heart failureor previous heart valve diseasealso are at higher risk for heart valve disease. In addition, having risk factors for IE, such as intravenous drug use, increases the risk of heart valve disease.\\n                \\nYou're also at higher risk for heart valve disease if you have risk factors for coronary heart disease. These risk factors include high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, smoking, insulin resistance, diabetes, overweight or obesity, lack of physical activity, and a family history of early heart disease.\\n                \\nSome people are born with an aortic valve that has two flaps instead of three. Sometimes an aortic valve may have three flaps, but two flaps are fused together and act as one flap. This is called a bicuspid or bicommissural aortic valve. People who have this congenital condition are more likely to develop aortic heart valve disease.\", \"Major Signs and Symptoms\\n                \\nThe main sign of heart valve disease is an unusual heartbeat sound called a heart murmur. Your doctor can hear a heart murmur with a stethoscope.\\n                \\nHowever, many people have heart murmurs without having heart valve disease or any other heart problems. Others may have heart murmurs due to heart valve disease, but have no other signs or symptoms.\\n                \\nHeart valve disease often worsens over time, so signs and symptoms may occur years after a heart murmur is first heard. Many people who have heart valve disease don't have any symptoms until they're middle-aged or older.\\n                \\nOther common signs and symptoms of heart valve disease relate to heart failure, which heart valve disease can cause. These signs and symptoms include:\\n                \\nUnusual fatigue (tiredness)\\n                \\nShortness of breath, especially when you exert yourself or when you're lying down\\n                \\nSwelling in your ankles, feet, legs, abdomen, and veins in the neck\\n                \\nOther Signs and Symptoms\\n                \\nHeart valve disease can cause chest pain that may happen only when you exert yourself. You also may notice a fluttering, racing, or irregular heartbeat. Some types of heart valve disease, such as aortic or mitral valve stenosis, can cause dizziness or fainting.\", \"Your primary care doctor may detect a heart murmur or other signs of heart valve disease. However, a cardiologist usually will diagnose the condition. A cardiologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating heart problems.\\n                \\nTo diagnose heart valve disease, your doctor will ask about your signs and symptoms. He or she also will do a physical exam and look at the results from tests and procedures.\\n                \\nPhysical Exam\\n                \\nYour doctor will listen to your heart with a stethoscope. He or she will want to find out whether you have a heart murmur that's likely caused by a heart valve problem.\\n                \\nYour doctor also will listen to your lungs as you breathe to check for fluid buildup. He or she will check for swollen ankles and other signs that your body is retaining water.\\n                \\nTests and Procedures\\n                \\nEchocardiography (echo) is the main test for diagnosing heart valve disease. But an EKG (electrocardiogram) or chest x ray commonly is used to reveal certain signs of the condition. If these signs are present, echo usually is done to confirm the diagnosis.\\n                \\nYour doctor also may recommend other tests and procedures if you're diagnosed with heart valve disease. For example, you may have cardiac catheterization, (KATH-eh-ter-ih-ZA-shun), stress testing, or cardiac MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). These tests and procedures help your doctor assess how severe your condition is so he or she can plan your treatment.\\n                \\nEKG\\n                \\nThis simple test detects and records the heart's electrical activity. An EKG can detect an irregular heartbeat and signs of a previous heart attack. It also can show whether your heart chambers are enlarged.\\n                \\nAn EKG usually is done in a doctor's office.\\n                \\nChest X Ray\\n                \\nThis test can show whether certain sections of your heart are enlarged, whether you have fluid in your lungs, or whether calcium deposits are present in your heart.\\n                \\nA chest x ray helps your doctor learn which type of valve defect you have, how severe it is, and whether you have any other heart problems.\\n                \\nEchocardiography\\n                \\nEcho uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart as it beats. A device called a transducer is placed on the surface of your chest.\\n                \\nThe transducer sends sound waves through your chest wall to your heart. Echoes from the sound waves are converted into pictures of your heart on a computer screen.\\n                \\nEcho can show:\\n                \\nThe size and shape of your heart valves and chambers\\n                \\nHow well your heart is pumping blood\\n                \\nWhether a valve is narrow or has backflow\\n                \\nYour doctor may recommend transesophageal (tranz-ih-sof-uh-JEE-ul) echo, or TEE, to get a better image of your heart.\\n                \\nDuring TEE, the transducer is attached to the end of a flexible tube. The tube is guided down your throat and into your esophagus (the passage leading from your mouth to your stomach). From there, your doctor can get detailed pictures of your heart.\\n                \\nYou'll likely be given medicine to help you relax during this procedure.\\n                \\nCardiac Catheterization\\n                \\nFor this procedure, a long, thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck and threaded to your heart. Your doctor uses x-ray images to guide the catheter.\\n                \\nThrough the catheter, your doctor does diagnostic tests and imaging that show whether backflow is occurring through a valve and how fully the valve opens. You'll be given medicine to help you relax, but you will be awake during the procedure.\\n                \\nYour doctor may recommend cardiac catheterization if your signs and symptoms of heart valve disease aren't in line with your echo results.\\n                \\nThe procedure also can help your doctor assess whether your symptoms are due to specific valve problems or coronary heart disease. All of this information helps your doctor decide the best way to treat you.\\n                \\nStress Test\\n                \\nDuring stress testing, you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests and imaging are done. If you can't exercise, you may be given medicine to raise your heart rate.\\n                \\nA stress test can show whether you have signs and symptoms of heart valve disease when your heart is working hard. It can help your doctor assess the severity of your heart valve disease.\\n                \\nCardiac MRI\\n                \\nCardiac MRI uses a powerful magnet and radio waves to make detailed images of your heart. A cardiac MRI image can confirm information about valve defects or provide more detailed information.\\n                \\nThis information can help your doctor plan your treatment. An MRI also may be done before heart valve surgery to help your surgeon plan for the surgery.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283465.9789739}
