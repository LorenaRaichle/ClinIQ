The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Congenital pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of metabolism/homeostasis - Alveolar proteinosis - Apnea - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Clubbing - Cyanosis - Desquamative interstitial pneumonitis - Dyspnea - Failure to thrive - Heterogeneous - Interstitial pulmonary disease - Pulmonary hypertension - Rapidly progressive - Respiratory distress - Respiratory failure - Tachypnea - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Nodular regenerative hyperplasia?

Common signs and symptoms include hyperextensible skin that is fragile and bruises easily; joint hypermobility; severe hypotonia at birth; progressive kyphoscoliosis (kyphosis and scoliosis); and fragility of the sclera. EDS, kyphoscoliosis type is caused by changes (mutations) in the PLOD1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is focused on preventing serious complications and relieving associated signs and symptoms.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, kyphoscoliosis type? The signs and symptoms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), kyphoscoliosis type vary but may include: Hyperextensible skin that is fragile and bruises easily Joint hypermobility that leads to frequent dislocations and subluxations (partial dislocations) Severe hypotonia at birth Progressive kyphoscoliosis (kyphosis and scoliosis), present at birth or within the first year of life Scleral fragility Abnormal wound healing \"Marfanoid habitus\" which is characterized by long, slender fingers (arachnodactyly); unusually long limbs; and a sunken chest (pectus excavatum) or protruding chest (pectus carinatum) Fragile arteries that are prone to rupture Delayed motor development Unusually small cornia Osteopenia (low bone density) Congenital clubfoot Cardiovascular abnormalities such as mitral valve prolapse or aortic root dilatation (enlargement of the blood vessel that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body) The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, kyphoscoliosis type.
