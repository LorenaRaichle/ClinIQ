Infectious diseases are caused by germs. Germs are tiny living things that are found everywhere - in air, soil and water. You can get infected by touching, eating, drinking or breathing something that contains a germ. Germs can also spread through animal and insect bites, kissing and sexual contact. Vaccines, proper hand washing and medicines can help prevent infections.     There are four main kinds of germs:        -  Bacteria - one-celled germs that multiply quickly and may release chemicals which can make you sick    -  Viruses - capsules that contain genetic material, and use your own cells to multiply    -  Fungi - primitive plants, like mushrooms or mildew     -  Protozoa - one-celled animals that use other living things for food and a place to live       NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases', 'Summary : If you have diabetes, your body cannot make or properly use insulin. This leads to high blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels. Healthy eating helps keep your blood sugar in your target range. It is a critical part of managing your diabetes, because controlling your blood sugar can prevent the complications of diabetes.     A registered dietitian can help make an eating plan just for you. It should take into account your weight, medicines, lifestyle, and other health problems you have.    Healthy diabetic eating includes        - Limiting foods that are high in sugar     - Eating smaller portions, spread out over the day    - Being careful about when and how many carbohydrates you eat    - Eating a variety of whole-grain foods, fruits and vegetables every day    - Eating less fat    - Limiting your use of alcohol    - Using less salt       NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a disease that causes inflammation and sores, called ulcers, in the lining of the rectum and colon. It is one of a group of diseases called inflammatory bowel disease.    UC can happen at any age, but it usually starts between the ages of 15 and 30. It tends to run in families. The most common symptoms are pain in the abdomen and blood or pus in diarrhea. Other symptoms may include       - Anemia    - Severe tiredness    - Weight loss    - Loss of appetite    - Bleeding from the rectum    - Sores on the skin    - Joint pain    - Growth failure in children       About half of people with UC have mild symptoms.    Doctors use blood tests, stool tests, colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, and imaging tests to diagnose UC. Several types of drugs can help control it. Some people have long periods of remission, when they are free of symptoms. In severe cases, doctors must remove the colon.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Your liver makes a digestive juice called bile. Your gallbladder stores it between meals. When you eat, your gallbladder pushes the bile into tubes called bile ducts. They carry the bile to your small intestine. The bile helps break down fat. It also helps the liver get rid of toxins and wastes.    Bile duct cancer is rare. It can happen in the parts of the bile ducts that are outside or inside the liver. Cancer of the bile duct outside of the liver is much more common. Risk factors include having inflammation of the bile duct, ulcerative colitis, and some liver diseases.    Symptoms can include       - Jaundice    - Itchy skin    - Fever    - Abdominal pain       Tests to diagnose bile duct cancer may include a physical exam, imaging tests of the liver and bile ducts, blood tests, and a biopsy.    Treatments include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.    NIH: National Cancer Institute']}"}, "time": 1746283466.883142}
