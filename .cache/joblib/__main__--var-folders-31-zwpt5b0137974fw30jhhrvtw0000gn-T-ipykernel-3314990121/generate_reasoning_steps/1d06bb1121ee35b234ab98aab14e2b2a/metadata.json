The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the deletion and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with chromosome 6p deletion include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems, and distinctive facial features. Chromosome 6p deletion can be de novo or inherited from a parent with a chromosomal rearrangement such as a balanced translocation. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.', 'Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome is an inherited condition that mainly affects the brain, immune system, and skin. It is characterized by early-onset severe brain dysfunction (encephalopathy) that usually results in severe intellectual and physical disability. Additional symptoms may include epilepsy, painful, itchy skin lesion (chilblains), vision problems, and joint stiffness. Symptoms usually progress over several months before the disease course stabilizes. There are six different types of Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, which are distinguished by the gene that causes the condition: TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, SAMHD1, and ADAR genes. Most cases are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, although rare autosomal dominant cases have been reported. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome type 5? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome type 5. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Cognitive impairment 90% Holoprosencephaly 90% Hypertonia 90% Porencephaly 90% Cleft eyelid 50% Hemiplegia/hemiparesis 50% Microcephaly 7.5% Plagiocephaly 7.5% Ptosis 7.5% Seizures 7.5% Autosomal recessive inheritance - Basal ganglia calcification - Chilblain lesions - Feeding difficulties in infancy - Leukodystrophy - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Oculo-cerebral dysplasia?
