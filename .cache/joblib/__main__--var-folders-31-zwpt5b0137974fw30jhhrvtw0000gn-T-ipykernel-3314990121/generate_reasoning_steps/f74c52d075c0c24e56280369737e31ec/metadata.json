The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Deafness, autosomal dominant nonsyndromic sensorineural 17. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal dominant inheritance - High-frequency hearing impairment - Juvenile onset - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Dysautonomia like disorder?

Most cases of stomach cancer occur sporadically in people with little to no family history of the condition; however, approximately 10% of stomach cancer is considered \"familial.\" Although the underlying cause of some familial cases is unknown, genetic changes (mutations) are identified in a subset of people affected by gastric cancer. Hereditary cancer syndromes associated with a predisposition to gastric cancer include hereditary diffuse gastric cancer, Lynch syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. In other families, the cluster of stomach cancers may be due to a combination of gene(s) and/or other shared factors such as environment and lifestyle. Depending on the estimated risk, high-risk cancer screening and/or prophylactic surgeries are typically recommended in people who have an increased risk for stomach cancer based on their personal and/or family histories.', 'Peters plus syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by abnormalities of the front part of the eye called the anterior chamber, short stature, cleft lip with or without cleft palate, and distinctive facial features.  The most common eye abnormality is Peters anomaly which involves the thinning and clouding of the cornea and attachment of the iris to the cornea causing blurred vision. Other eye abnormalities such as glaucoma and cataracts are common. The severity of symptoms may vary from person to person. The only gene that has been associated with Peters plus syndrome is B3GALTL. The syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Treatment varies based on the severity of the symptoms; however, regular appointments with an ophthalmologist and avoidance of agents that increase the risk of glaucoma (e.g., corticosteroids) is recommended.']}"}, "time": 1746283456.9071748}
