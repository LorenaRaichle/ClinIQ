Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA) is a genetic disorder that is typically characterized by tall height; skinny, long limbs; long, skinny fingers and toes (arachnodactyly); multiple joint deformities present at birth (congenital contractures), usually of the elbows, knees, hips, fingers and ankles; \"crumpled\"-looking ears, and curvature of the spine (kyphoscoliosis). Other features might also be present and vary from person to person. CCA is caused by mutations in a gene called FBN2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. CCA shares similiar signs and symptoms to Marfan syndrome; however, Marfan syndrome is not caused by mutations in the FBN2 gene.', \"What are the signs and symptoms of Congenital contractural arachnodactyly? Congenital contractural arachnodactyly represents a broad spectrum of characteristics. The features are quite variable, both within and between families. The classic form is characterized by a Marfan-like appearance (tall and slender with arm span exceeding height), arachnodactyly (long slender fingers and toes), 'crumpled' ears, contractures of major joints from birth (particularly knees, elbows, fingers, toes, and hips), bowed long bones, muscular hypoplasia (underdeveloped muscles), kyphosis/scoliosis, aortic root dilation, and various craniofacial abnormalities (such as micrognathia, high arched palate, scaphocephaly (premature fusion of the sagittal suture of the skull leading to a long, narrow head), brachycephaly (premature fusion of the coronal suture, leading to a short skull), and frontal bossing).  At the most severe end of the spectrum is a rare type with very few reported cases. In addition to the typical skeletal findings (arachnodactyly, joint contractures, scoliosis) and abnormally shaped ears, infants with the severe/lethal form have multiple cardiovascular and gastrointestinal abnormalities.

The FBN2 gene provides instructions for producing the fibrillin-2 protein. Fibrillin-2 binds to other proteins and molecules to form threadlike filaments called microfibrils. Microfibrils become part of the fibers that provide strength and flexibility to connective tissue. Additionally, microfibrils hold molecules called growth factors and release them at the appropriate time to control the growth and repair of tissues and organs throughout the body. A mutation in the FBN2 gene can reduce the amount and/or quality of fibrillin-2 that is available to form microfibrils. As a result, decreased microfibril formation weakens the elastic fibers and allows growth factors to be released inappropriately, causing tall stature, deformities of the fingers and toes, and other characteristic features of congenital contractural arachnodactyly.']}"}, "time": 1746283455.1581628}
