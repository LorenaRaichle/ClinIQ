The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Lung adenocarcinoma. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Alveolar cell carcinoma - Autosomal recessive inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1C?

Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal dominant inheritance - Decreased motor nerve conduction velocity - Distal amyotrophy - Distal muscle weakness - Distal sensory impairment - Hypertrophic nerve changes - Hyporeflexia - Juvenile onset - Onion bulb formation - Pes cavus - Segmental peripheral demyelination/remyelination - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition.

The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the deletion and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with chromosome 19p deletion include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems and distinctive facial features. Chromosome testing of both parents can provide more information on whether or not the deletion was inherited. In most cases, parents do not have any chromosomal anomaly. However, sometimes one parent is found to have a balanced translocation, where a piece of a chromosome has broken off and attached to another one with no gain or loss of genetic material. The balanced translocation normally does not cause any signs or symptoms, but it increases the risk for having an affected child with a chromosomal anomaly like a deletion. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. This page is meant to provide general information about 19p deletions. You can contact GARD if you have questions about a specific deletion on chromosome 19. To learn more about chromosomal anomalies please visit our GARD webpage on FAQs about Chromosome Disorders.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Spinal intradural arachnoid cysts?
