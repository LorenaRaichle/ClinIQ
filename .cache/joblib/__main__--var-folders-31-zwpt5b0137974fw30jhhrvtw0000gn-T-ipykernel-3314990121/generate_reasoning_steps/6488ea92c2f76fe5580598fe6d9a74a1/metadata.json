Signs and symptoms usually appear at birth or in early childhood and include low platelet counts, easy bruising, prolonged bleeding, and nose bleeds. Affected individuals often have myelofibrosis and splenomegaly. Bleeding tendency is usually mild to moderate in those with mild thrombocytopenia. However, the thrombocytopenia and myelofibrosis are usually progressive in nature. GPS may result in fatal hemorrhage (bleeding), especially in adulthood when platelet counts are further decreased. Female patients may develop heavy menstrual bleeding. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Gray platelet syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of coagulation 90% Bruising susceptibility 90% Thrombocytopenia 90% Abnormality of the menstrual cycle 50% Epistaxis 50% Myelodysplasia 50% Splenomegaly 50% Autosomal dominant inheritance - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Impaired collagen-induced platelet aggregation - Impaired thrombin-induced platelet aggregation - Menorrhagia - Myelofibrosis - Progressive - Prolonged bleeding time - Reduced quantity of Von Willebrand factor - Reduced von Willebrand factor activity - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'How might gray platelet syndrome (GPS) be treated? There is no specific treatment for GPS, but management involves anticipating and preventing risks of bleeding (e.g. possible platelet transfusions before surgery). Treatment may also include administration of desmopressin. Splenectomy should be considered to increase the platelet counts in those whose platelet counts decrease to approximately 30,000/microliter. Prognosis is generally good early in life when thrombocytopenia is mild. Those with platelets counts less than 30,000/microliter are at risk for life-threatening bleeding.', 'Proud syndrome is a rare neurological condition that is primarily characterized by severe intellectual disability, agenesis of the corpus callosum, seizures, and spasticity. It usually occurs in males; when it occurs in females, the signs and symptoms are often less severe. Proud syndrome is caused by changes (mutations) in the ARX gene and is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Proud syndrome? The most common signs and symptoms of Proud syndrome are: Agenesis of the corpus callosum Severe intellectual disability Seizures Stiff and/or rigid muscles (spasticity) Other features may include microcephaly (unusually small head), limb contractures, scoliosis, characteristic facial features, kidney malformations, and genital abnormalities (i.e. cryptorchidism, hypospadias). Proud syndrome usually occurs in males; when it occurs in females, the signs and symptoms are often less severe.
