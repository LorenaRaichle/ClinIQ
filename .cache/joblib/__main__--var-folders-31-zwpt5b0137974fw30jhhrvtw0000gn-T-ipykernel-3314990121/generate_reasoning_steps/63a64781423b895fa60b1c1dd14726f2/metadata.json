It\\'s important to take care of yourself. Ask for and accept help.    Talk to the doctor. Find out what treatments might help control symptoms or address behavior problems. Find a support group. Others who have \"been there\" may be able to help and will understand.     If there are times of day that the person is less confused or more cooperative, take advantage of that in daily routines. Consider using adult day care or respite services. These offer a break with the peace of mind that the patient is being taken care of. Begin to plan for the future. This may include        -  Getting financial and legal documents in order    -  Looking into assisted living or nursing homes    -  Finding out what your health insurance and Medicare will cover       NIH: National Institute on Aging', \"Whooping cough is an infectious bacterial disease that causes uncontrollable coughing. The name comes from the noise you make when you take a breath after you cough. You may have choking spells or may cough so hard that you vomit.     Anyone can get whooping cough, but it is more common in infants and children. It's especially dangerous for infants. The coughing spells can be so bad that it is hard for infants to eat, drink, or breathe.    To make a diagnosis, your doctor may do a physical exam, blood tests, chest x-rays, or nose or throat cultures.    Before there was a vaccine, whooping cough was one of the most common childhood diseases and a major cause of childhood deaths in the U.S. Now most cases are prevented by vaccines. If you have whooping cough, treatment with antibiotics may help if given early.    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\", 'Warts are growths on your skin caused by an infection with humanpapilloma virus, or HPV. Types of warts include        - Common warts, which often appear on your fingers     - Plantar warts, which show up on the soles of your feet     - Genital warts, which are a sexually transmitted disease     - Flat warts, which appear in places you shave frequently        In children, warts often go away on their own. In adults, they tend to stay. If they hurt or bother you, or if they multiply, you can remove them. Chemical skin treatments usually work. If not, various freezing, surgical and laser treatments can remove warts.', 'A scar is a permanent patch of skin that grows over a wound. It forms when your body heals itself after a cut, scrape, burn, or sore. You can also get scars from surgery that cuts through the skin, infections like chickenpox, or skin conditions like acne. Scars are often thicker, as well as pinker, redder, or shinier, than the rest of your skin.     How your scar looks depends on       - How big and deep your wound is    - Where it is     - How long it takes to heal     - Your age    - Your inherited tendency to scar       Scars usually fade over time but never go away completely. If the way a scar looks bothers you, various treatments might minimize it. These include surgical revision, dermabrasion, laser treatments, injections, chemical peels, and creams.']}"}, "time": 1746283467.808326}
