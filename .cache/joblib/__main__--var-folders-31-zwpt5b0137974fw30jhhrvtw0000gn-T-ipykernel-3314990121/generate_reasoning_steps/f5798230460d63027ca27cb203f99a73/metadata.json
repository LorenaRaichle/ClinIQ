These tubes carry air to your lungs. (For more information about the bronchial tubes and airways, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index How the Lungs Work article.)\\n                \\nPeople who have bronchitis often have a cough that brings up mucus. Mucus is a slimy substance made by the lining of the bronchial tubes. Bronchitis also may cause wheezing (a whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe), chest pain or discomfort, a low fever, and shortness of breath.\\n                \\nBronchitis\\n                \\n\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nThe two main types of bronchitis are acute (short term) and chronic (ongoing).\\n                \\nAcute Bronchitis\\n                \\nInfections or lung irritants cause acute bronchitis. The same viruses that cause colds and the flu are the most common cause of acute bronchitis. These viruses are spread through the air when people cough. They also are spread through physical contact (for example, on hands that have not been washed).\\n                \\nSometimes bacteria cause acute bronchitis.\\n                \\nAcute bronchitis lasts from a few days to 10 days. However, coughing may last for several weeks after the infection is gone.\\n                \\nSeveral factors increase your risk for acute bronchitis. Examples include exposure to tobacco smoke (including secondhand smoke), dust, fumes, vapors, and air pollution. Avoiding these lung irritants as much as possible can help lower your risk for acute bronchitis.\\n                \\nMost cases of acute bronchitis go away within a few days. If you think you have acute bronchitis, see your doctor. He or she will want to rule out other, more serious health conditions that require medical care.\\n                \\nChronic Bronchitis\\n                \\nChronic bronchitis is an ongoing, serious condition. It occurs if the lining of the bronchial tubes is constantly irritated and inflamed, causing a long-term cough with mucus. Smoking is the main cause of chronic bronchitis.\\n                \\nViruses or bacteria can easily infect the irritated bronchial tubes. If this happens, the condition worsens and lasts longer. As a result, people who have chronic bronchitis have periods when symptoms get much worse than usual.\\n                \\nChronic bronchitis is a serious, long-term medical condition. Early diagnosis and treatment, combined with quitting smoking and avoiding secondhand smoke, can improve quality of life. The chance of complete recovery is low for people who have severe chronic bronchitis.', 'Acute Bronchitis\\n                \\nInfections or lung irritants cause acute bronchitis. The same viruses that cause colds and the flu are the most common cause of acute bronchitis. Sometimes bacteria can cause the condition.\\n                \\nCertain substances can irritate your lungs and airways and raise your risk for acute bronchitis. For example, inhaling or being exposed to tobacco smoke, dust, fumes, vapors, or air pollution raises your risk for the condition. These lung irritants also can make symptoms worse.\\n                \\nBeing exposed to a high level of dust or fumes, such as from an explosion or a big fire, also may lead to acute bronchitis.\\n                \\nChronic Bronchitis\\n                \\nRepeatedly breathing in fumes that irritate and damage lung and airway tissues causes chronic bronchitis. Smoking is the major cause of the condition.\\n                \\nBreathing in air pollution and dust or fumes from the environment or workplace also can lead to chronic bronchitis.\\n                \\nPeople who have chronic bronchitis go through periods when symptoms become much worse than usual. During these times, they also may have acute viral or bacterial bronchitis.', 'Bronchitis is a very common condition. Millions of cases occur every year.\\n                \\nElderly people, infants, and young children are at higher risk for acute bronchitis than people in other age groups.\\n                \\nPeople of all ages can develop chronic bronchitis, but it occurs more often in people who are older than 45. Also, many adults who develop chronic bronchitis are smokers. Women are more than twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with chronic bronchitis.\\n                \\nSmoking and having an existing lung disease greatly increase your risk for bronchitis. Contact with dust, chemical fumes, and vapors from certain jobs also increases your risk for the condition. Examples include jobs in coal mining, textile manufacturing, grain handling, and livestock farming.\\n                \\nAir pollution, infections, and allergies can worsen the symptoms of chronic bronchitis, especially if you smoke.']}"}, "time": 1746283466.5309172}
