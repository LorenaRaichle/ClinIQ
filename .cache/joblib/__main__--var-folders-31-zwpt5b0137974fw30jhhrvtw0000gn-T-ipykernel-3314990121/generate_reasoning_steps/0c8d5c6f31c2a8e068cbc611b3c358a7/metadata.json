Bleeding can occur inside your body (internal bleeding) or underneath your skin or from the surface of your skin (external bleeding).\\n                \\nSigns and symptoms can appear suddenly or over time. Mild thrombocytopenia often has no signs or symptoms. Many times, it's found during a routine blood test.\\n                \\nCheck with your doctor if you have any signs of bleeding. Severe thrombocytopenia can cause bleeding in almost any part of the body. Bleeding can lead to a medical emergency and should be treated right away.\\n                \\nExternal bleeding usually is the first sign of a low platelet count. External bleeding may cause purpura (PURR-purr-ah) or petechiae (peh-TEE-key-ay). Purpura are purple, brown, and red bruises. This bruising may happen easily and often. Petechiae are small red or purple dots on your skin.\\n                \\nPurpura and Petechiae\\n                \\n\\n                \\nOther signs of external bleeding include:\\n                \\nProlonged bleeding, even from minor cuts\\n                \\nBleeding or oozing from the mouth or nose, especially nosebleeds or bleeding from brushing your teeth\\n                \\nAbnormal vaginal bleeding (especially heavy menstrual flow)\\n                \\nA lot of bleeding after surgery or dental work also might suggest a bleeding problem.\\n                \\nHeavy bleeding into the intestines or the brain (internal bleeding) is serious and can be fatal. Signs and symptoms include:\\n                \\nBlood in the urine or stool or bleeding from the rectum. Blood in the stool can appear as red blood or as a dark, tarry color. (Taking iron supplements also can cause dark, tarry stools.)\\n                \\nHeadaches and other neurological symptoms. These problems are very rare, but you should discuss them with your doctor.\", \"Your doctor will diagnose thrombocytopenia based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. A hematologist also may be involved in your care. This is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating blood diseases and conditions.\\n                \\nOnce thrombocytopenia is diagnosed, your doctor will begin looking for its cause.\\n                \\nMedical History\\n                \\nYour doctor may ask about factors that can affect your platelets, such as:\\n                \\nThe medicines you take, including over-the-counter medicines and herbal remedies, and whether you drink beverages that contain quinine. Quinine is a substance often found in tonic water and nutritional health products.\\n                \\nYour general eating habits, including the amount of alcohol you normally drink.\\n                \\nYour risk for AIDS, including questions about blood transfusions, sexual partners, intravenous (IV) drugs, and exposure to infectious blood or bodily fluids at work.\\n                \\nAny family history of low platelet counts.\\n                \\nPhysical Exam\\n                \\nYour doctor will do a physical exam to look for signs and symptoms of bleeding, such as bruises or spots on the skin. He or she will check your abdomen for signs of an enlarged spleen or liver. You also will be checked for signs of infection, such as a fever.\\n                \\nDiagnostic Tests\\n                \\nYour doctor may recommend one or more of the following tests to help diagnose a low platelet count. For more information about blood tests, go to the Health Topics Blood Tests article.\\n                \\nComplete Blood Count\\n                \\nA complete blood count (CBC) measures the levels of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. For this test, a small amount of blood is drawn from a blood vessel, usually in your arm.\\n                \\nIf you have thrombocytopenia, the results of this test will show that your platelet count is low.\\n                \\nBlood Smear\\n                \\nA blood smear is used to check the appearance of your platelets under a microscope. For this test, a small amount of blood is drawn from a blood vessel, usually in your arm.\\n                \\nBone Marrow Tests\\n                \\nBone marrow tests check whether your bone marrow is healthy. Blood cells, including platelets, are made in your bone marrow. The two bone marrow tests are aspiration (as-pih-RA-shun) and biopsy.\\n                \\nBone marrow aspiration might be done to find out why your bone marrow isn't making enough blood cells. For this test, your doctor removes a sample of fluid bone marrow through a needle. He or she examines the sample under a microscope to check for faulty cells.\\n                \\nA bone marrow biopsy often is done right after an aspiration. For this test, your doctor removes a sample of bone marrow tissue through a needle. He or she examines the tissue to check the number and types of cells in the bone marrow.\\n                \\nOther Tests\\n                \\nIf a bleeding problem is suspected, you may need other blood tests as well. For example, your doctor may recommend PT and PTT tests to see whether your blood is clotting properly.\\n                \\nYour doctor also may suggest an ultrasound to check your spleen. An ultrasound uses sound waves to create pictures of your spleen. This will allow your doctor to see whether your spleen is enlarged.\", \"Treatment for thrombocytopenia depends on its cause and severity. The main goal of treatment is to prevent death and disability caused by bleeding.\\n                \\nIf your condition is mild, you may not need treatment. A fully normal platelet count isn't necessary to prevent bleeding, even with severe cuts or accidents.\\n                \\nThrombocytopenia often improves when its underlying cause is treated. People who inherit the condition usually don't need treatment.\\n                \\nIf a reaction to a medicine is causing a low platelet count, your doctor may prescribe another medicine. Most people recover after the initial medicine has been stopped. For heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), stopping the heparin isn't enough. Often, you'll need another medicine to prevent blood clotting.\\n                \\nIf your immune system is causing a low platelet count, your doctor may prescribe medicines to suppress the immune system.\\n                \\nSevere Thrombocytopenia\\n                \\nIf your thrombocytopenia is severe, your doctor may prescribe treatments such as medicines, blood or platelet transfusions, or splenectomy.\\n                \\nMedicines\\n                \\nYour doctor may prescribe corticosteroids, also called steroids for short. Steroids may slow platelet destruction. These medicines can be given through a vein or by mouth. One example of this type of medicine is prednisone.\\n                \\nThe steroids used to treat thrombocytopenia are different from illegal steroids taken by some athletes to enhance performance.\\n                \\nYour doctor may prescribe immunoglobulins or medicines like rituximab to block your immune system. These medicines are given through a vein. He or she also may prescribe other medicines, such as eltrombopag or romiplostim, to help your body make more platelets. The former comes as a tablet to take by mouth and the latter is given as an injection under the skin.\\n                \\nBlood or Platelet Transfusions\\n                \\nBlood or platelet transfusions are used to treat people who have active bleeding or are at a high risk of bleeding. During this procedure, a needle is used to insert an intravenous (IV) line into one of your blood vessels. Through this line, you receive healthy blood or platelets.\\n                \\nFor more information about this procedure, go to the Health Topics Blood Transfusion article.\\n                \\nSplenectomy\\n                \\nA splenectomy is surgery to remove the spleen. This surgery may be used if treatment with medicines doesn't work. This surgery mostly is used for adults who have immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). However, medicines often are the first course of treatment.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283466.33101}
