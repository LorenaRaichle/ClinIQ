Some groups of people have higher rates of certain diseases, and more deaths and suffering from them, compared to others. These groups may be based on       - Race    - Ethnicity    - Immigrant status    - Disability    - Sex or gender    - Sexual orientation    - Geography    - Income       NIH: National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities', 'Summary : Health facilities are places that provide health care. They include hospitals, clinics, outpatient care centers, and specialized care centers, such as birthing centers and psychiatric care centers.    When you choose a health facility, you might want to consider       - How close it is to where you live or work    - Whether your health insurance will pay for services there    - Whether your health care provider can treat you there    - The quality of the facility       Quality is important. Some facilities do a better job than others. One way to learn about the quality of a facility is to look at report cards developed by federal, state, and consumer groups.', 'Genital warts are a sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). The warts are soft, moist, pink, or flesh-colored bumps. You can have one or many of these bumps. In women, the warts usually occur in or around the vagina, on the cervix or around the anus. In men, genital warts are less common but might occur on the tip of the penis.     You can get genital warts during oral, vaginal, or anal sex with an infected partner. Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading HPV. HPV vaccines may help prevent some of the HPV infections that cause genital warts.    Your health care provider usually diagnoses genital warts by seeing them. The warts might disappear on their own. If not, your health care provider can treat or remove them. The virus stays in your body even after treatment, so warts can come back.    NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases', \"A fistula is an abnormal connection between two parts inside of the body. Fistulas may develop between different organs, such as between the esophagus and the windpipe or the bowel and the vagina. They can also develop between two blood vessels, such as between an artery and a vein or between two arteries.    Some people are born with a fistula. Other common causes of fistulas include       - Complications from surgery    - Injury    - Infection    - Diseases, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis       Treatment depends on the cause of the fistula, where it is, and how bad it is. Some fistulas will close on their own. In some cases, you may need antibiotics and/or surgery.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283466.843168}
