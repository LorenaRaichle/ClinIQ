The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Myopathy congenital. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the nervous system - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Myopathy - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Abetalipoproteinemia is a condition characterized by the inability to fully absorb dietary fats, cholesterol and fat-soluble vitamins. Signs and symptoms appear in the first few months of life and can include failure to thrive; diarrhea; acanthocytosis; and stool abnormalities. Other features develop later in childhood and often impair the function of the nervous system, potentially causing slower intellectual development; poor muscle coordination; progressive ataxia; and an eye disorder called retinitis pigmentosa. Most of the symptoms are due to defects in the absorption and transport of vitamin E. Abetalipoproteinemia is caused by mutations in the MTTP gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Early diagnosis, high-dose vitamin E therapy, and medium-chain fatty acid supplements may slow the progression of the nervous system abnormalities. Long-term outlook is reasonably good for most affected people who are diagnosed early. If left untreated, the condition can result in early death.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Abetalipoproteinemia? The signs and symptoms of abetalipoproteinemia usually appear in the first few months of life. They can include: failure to thrive in infancy digestive symptoms such as diarrhea and steatorrhea (foul-smelling stools) abnormal, star-shaped red blood cells (acanthocytosis) nervous system (neurologic) symptoms beginning in childhood such as slower intellectual development; peripheral neuropathy; poor muscle coordination; ataxia; and intention tremors eye (ophthalmologic) symptoms such as decreased night and color vision; retinitis pigmentosa in adolescence; and gradual deterioration of vision, often leading to blindness in the fourth decade of life The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Abetalipoproteinemia.

In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What causes abetalipoproteinemia? Abetalipoproteinemia is caused by changes (mutations) in the MTTP gene. The MTTP gene gives the body instructions to make a protein needed for creating beta-lipoproteins. These lipoproteins are necessary for the body to absorb fats, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A, D, E and K), and for transporting these substances in the blood. Mutations in the MTTP result in a lack of beta-lipoproteins, leading to an inability to absorb and transport these substances. This in turn leads to the nutritional and neurologic problems in affected people.']}"}, "time": 1746283456.030161}
