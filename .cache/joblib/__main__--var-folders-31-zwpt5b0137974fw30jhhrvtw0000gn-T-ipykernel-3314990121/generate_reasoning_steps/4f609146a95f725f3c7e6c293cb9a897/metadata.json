It is a group of diseases that cause abnormal growth of connective tissue. Connective tissue is the material inside your body that gives your tissues their shape and helps keep them strong. In scleroderma, the tissue gets hard or thick. It can cause swelling or pain in your muscles and joints.    Symptoms of scleroderma include        -  Calcium deposits in connective tissues    -  Raynaud's phenomenon, a narrowing of blood vessels in the hands or feet    -  Swelling of the esophagus, the tube between your throat and stomach    -  Thick, tight skin on your fingers    -  Red spots on your hands and face        No one knows what causes scleroderma. It is more common in women. It can be mild or severe. Doctors diagnose scleroderma using your medical history, a physical exam, lab tests, and a skin biopsy. There is no cure, but various treatments can control symptoms and complications.     NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases\", \"Valley Fever is a disease caused by a fungus (or mold) called Coccidioides. The fungi live in the soil of dry areas like the southwestern U.S. You get it from inhaling the spores of the fungus. The infection cannot spread from person to person.    Anyone can get Valley Fever. But it's most common among older adults, especially those 60 and older. People who have recently moved to an area where it occurs are at highest risk for infection. Other people at higher risk include       - Workers in jobs that expose them to soil dust. These include construction workers, agricultural workers, and military forces doing field training.    - African Americans and Asians    - Women in their third trimester of pregnancy    - People with weak immune systems       Valley Fever is often mild, with no symptoms. If you have symptoms, they may include a flu-like illness, with fever, cough, headache, rash, and muscle aches. Most people get better within several weeks or months. A small number of people may develop a chronic lung or widespread infection.    Valley Fever is diagnosed by testing your blood, other body fluids, or tissues. Many people with the acute infection get better without treatment. In some cases, doctors may prescribe antifungal drugs for acute infections. Severe infections require antifungal drugs.    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\", \"Summary : College life involves excitement, along with new challenges, risks, and responsibilities. You are meeting new people, learning new things, and making your own decisions. It can sometimes be stressful. You have to deal with pressures related to food, drink, appearance, drugs, and sexual activity.    There are steps you can take to stay healthy and safe while you're in college:       - Eat a balanced diet    - Get enough sleep    - Get regular physical activity    - Maintain your health with checkups and vaccinations    - If you decide to have sex, practice safe sex    - Make smart choices about alcohol and drugs    - Get help if you are stressed or depressed       Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\", \"Lyme disease is a bacterial infection you get from the bite of an infected tick. The first symptom is usually a rash, which may look like a bull's eye. As the infection spreads, you may have       - A fever    - A headache    - Muscle and joint aches    - A stiff neck    - Fatigue       Lyme disease can be hard to diagnose because you may not have noticed a tick bite. Also, many of its symptoms are like those of the flu and other diseases. In the early stages, your health care provider will look at your symptoms and medical history, to figure out whether you have Lyme disease. Lab tests may help at this stage, but may not always give a clear answer. In the later stages of the disease, a different lab test can confirm whether you have it.    Antibiotics can cure most cases of Lyme disease. The sooner treatment begins, the quicker and more complete the recovery.    After treatment, some patients may still have muscle or joint aches and nervous system symptoms. This is called post-Lyme disease syndrome (PLDS). Long-term antibiotics have not been shown to help with PLDS. However, there are ways to help with the symptoms of PLDS, and most patients do get better with time.
