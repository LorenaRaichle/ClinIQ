The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Nasodigitoacoustic syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of thumb phalanx 90% Anonychia 90% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the distal phalanges of the toes 90% Broad forehead 90% Hypertelorism 90% Preaxial foot polydactyly 90% Prominent nasal bridge 90% Sensorineural hearing impairment 90% Short distal phalanx of finger 90% Short hallux 90% Abnormality of the voice 50% Aplastic/hypoplastic toenail 50% Clinodactyly of the 5th finger 50% Epicanthus 50% Exaggerated cupid's bow 50% Macrocephaly 50% Ptosis 50% Tented upper lip vermilion 50% Behavioral abnormality 7.5% Cognitive impairment 7.5% Short stature 7.5% Abnormality of the nail - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Broad distal phalanx of finger - Broad hallux - Broad thumb - Depressed nasal bridge - Enlarged epiphyses - Frontal bossing - High palate - Hoarse voice - Narrow palate - Prominent forehead - Pulmonic stenosis - Rounded epiphyses - Short 3rd metacarpal - Short phalanx of finger - Short toe - Thick upper lip vermilion - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.\", 'Adult-onset Still\\'s disease is an inflammatory condition characterized by high fevers, rash, sore throat, and joint pain. As it progresses, adult-onset Still\\'s disease may lead to chronic arthritis and other complications. Still\\'s disease was named after an English doctor named George Still, who described the condition in children in 1896. Still\\'s disease which occurs in children (those under the age of 16) is now known as systemic onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA). In 1971, the term \"adult Still\\'s disease\" was used to describe adults who had a condition similar to systemic onset JRA. The cause of adult-onset Still\\'s disease is unknown. No risk factors for the disease have been identified. There\\'s no cure for adult-onset Still\\'s disease; however, treatment may offer symptom relief and help prevent complications.', \"What are the signs and symptoms of Adult-onset Still's disease?

Some hypothesize that the condition results from or is triggered by a virus or other infectious agent. Others believe that it is a hypersensitive or autoimmune disorder. To date, no conclusive evidence has been found to prove or disprove either theory.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283455.36252}
