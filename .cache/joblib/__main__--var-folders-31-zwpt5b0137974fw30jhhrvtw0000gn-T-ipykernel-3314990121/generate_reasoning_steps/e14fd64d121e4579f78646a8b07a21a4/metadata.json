The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Leukoencephalopathy - dystonia - motor neuropathy . If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal motor neuron morphology - Abnormality of saccadic eye movements - Abnormality of thalamus morphology - Azoospermia - Head tremor - Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism - Hyposmia - Intention tremor - Leukoencephalopathy - Peripheral neuropathy - Torticollis - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Weaver syndrome is a rare condition that is characterized primarily by tall stature. Other signs and symptoms of the condition may include macrocephaly (unusually large head size); intellectual disability; distinctive facial features; camptodactyly (permanently bent digits) of the fingers and/or toes; poor coordination; soft and doughy skin; umbilical hernia; abnormal muscle tone; and a hoarse, low-pitched cry during infancy. Some studies also suggest that people affected by Weaver syndrome may have an increased risk of developing neuroblastoma. Weaver syndrome is usually caused by changes (mutations) in the EZH2 gene. Although the condition is considered autosomal dominant, most cases occur as de novo mutations in people with no family history of the condition. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Weaver syndrome?

In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Cohen syndrome is a congenital (present since birth) condition that was first described in 1973 by Dr. M.M. Cohen, Jr. When the syndrome was first described, it was believed that its main features were obesity, hypotonia (low muscle tone), intellectual disabilities, distinctive facial features with prominent upper central teeth and abnormalities of the hands and feet. Since Cohen syndrome was first described, over 100 cases have been reported worldwide. It is now known that the signs and symptoms present in people with Cohen syndrome may vary considerably. Although the exact cause of Cohen syndrome is unknown, some people with the condition have been found to have mutations in a gene called COH1 (also referred to as VPS13B). When Cohen syndrome is found to be inherited in families, it follows an autosomal recessive pattern. No cure is currently available; however, treatment for Cohen syndrome is focused on improving or alleviating signs and symptoms as they arise.']}"}, "time": 1746283459.492126}
