Plaque is made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, fibrous tissue, and other substances in the blood. P.A.D. currently affects millions of Americans, and about 1 in every 20 Americans over the age of 50 has P.A.D.', 'The most common cause of P.A.D. is atherosclerosis, a buildup of plaque in the arteries. Over time, plaque can harden and narrow the arteries. This limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your organs and other parts of your body.', 'Smoking is the main risk factor for P.A.D. Your risk of P.A.D. increases four times if you smoke. Smoking also raises your risk for other diseases, such as coronary heart disease (CHD). On average, smokers who develop P.A.D. have symptoms 10 years earlier than nonsmokers who develop P.A.D. As you get older, your risk for P.A.D. increases, usually starting in your fifties. Older age combined with other risk factors, such as smoking or diabetes, also puts you at higher risk. African American men and women have a greater risk of developing P.A.D. than Caucasians. Your risk for P.A.D. is higher if you have diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, heart disease, or have had a stroke. A family history of these conditions also makes P.A.D. more likely.', 'People who have P.A.D. may have symptoms when walking or climbing stairs. These may include pain, numbness, aching, or heaviness in the leg muscles. Symptoms may also include cramping in the affected leg(s) and in the buttocks, thighs, calves, and feet. Some possible signs of P.A.D. include - weak or absent pulses in the legs or feet  - sores or wounds on the toes, feet, or legs that heal slowly  - a pale or bluish color to the skin  - poor nail growth on the toes and decreased hair growth on the legs  - erectile dysfunction, especially among men who have diabetes. weak or absent pulses in the legs or feet sores or wounds on the toes, feet, or legs that heal slowly a pale or bluish color to the skin poor nail growth on the toes and decreased hair growth on the legs erectile dysfunction, especially among men who have diabetes.']}"}, "time": 1746283468.507021}
