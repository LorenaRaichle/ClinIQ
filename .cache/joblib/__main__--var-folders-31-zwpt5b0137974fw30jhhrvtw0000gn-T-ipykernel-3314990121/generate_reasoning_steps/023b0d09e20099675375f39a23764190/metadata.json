These include - an ankle-brachial index (ABI). This test compares blood pressure in your ankle to blood pressure in your arm. It shows how well blood is flowing in your limbs.  - a Doppler ultrasound. This test uses sound waves to show whether a blood vessel is blocked. A blood pressure cuff and special device measure blood flow in the veins and arteries of the limbs. A Doppler ultrasound can help find out how where P.A.D. is.   - a treadmill test. This test shows if you have any problems during normal walking, how severe your symptoms are, and what level of exercise brings them on.  - a magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA). This test uses magnetic and radio waves to take pictures of your blood vessels. An MRA can find the location of a blocked blood vessel and show how severe the blockage is.   - an arteriogram. This test is used to find the exact location of a blocked artery. Dye is injected through a needle or catheter (thin tube) into an artery, then an X-ray is taken. The pictures from the X-ray can show the location, type, and extent of the blockage in the artery.   - blood tests.

Two examples of healthy eating plans are Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) and  Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH).\", \"Yes. In some people, lifestyle changes are not enough to control P.A.D. Surgery and other procedures may be needed. These may include bypass grafting surgery, angioplasty, a stent, or a procedure called atherectomy (ath-eh-REK-to-mee). - Your doctor may recommend bypass grafting surgery if blood flow in your limb is blocked or nearly blocked. In this type of surgery, a blood vessel from another part of the body or a man-made tube is used to make a graft. This graft bypasses (goes around) the blocked part of the artery, which allows blood to flow around the blockage. This surgery doesn't cure P.A.D., but it may increase blood flow to the affected limb.  Your doctor may recommend bypass grafting surgery if blood flow in your limb is blocked or nearly blocked.

This surgery doesn't cure P.A.D., but it may increase blood flow to the affected limb. - Angioplasty is used to restore blood flow through a narrowed or blocked artery. During this procedure, a catheter (thin tube) with a balloon or other device on the end is inserted into a blocked artery. The balloon is inflated, which pushes the plaque outward against the wall of the artery. This widens the artery and restores blood flow.

This widens the artery and restores blood flow. - A stent (a small mesh tube) may be placed in the artery during angioplasty. A stent helps keep the artery open after the procedure is done. Some stents are coated with medicine to help prevent blockages in the artery. A stent (a small mesh tube) may be placed in the artery during angioplasty.

During the procedure, a catheter (thin tube) is used to insert a small cutting device into the blocked artery. The device is used to shave or cut off the plaque. The bits of plaque are removed from the body through the catheter or washed away in the bloodstream (if theyre small enough). Doctors also can do atherectomy using a special laser that dissolves the blockage. A procedure called atherectomy (ath-eh-REK-to-mee) may be used to remove plaque buildup from an artery.

For example, NHLBI-supported research on P.A.D. includes studies that - explore whether group walking sessions increase physical activity in people who have P.A.D.  - compare how effective certain exercise programs are at reducing leg pain in people who have P.A.D.  - examine how inflammation and insulin resistance affect people who have P.A.D.  explore whether group walking sessions increase physical activity in people who have P.A.D. compare how effective certain exercise programs are at reducing leg pain in people who have P.A.D. examine how inflammation and insulin resistance affect people who have P.A.D. Much of this research depends on the willingness of volunteers to take part in clinical trials. Clinical trials test new ways to prevent, diagnose, or treat various diseases and conditions. Carefully conducted clinical trials are the fastest and safest way to find treatments that work in people and ways to improve health.
