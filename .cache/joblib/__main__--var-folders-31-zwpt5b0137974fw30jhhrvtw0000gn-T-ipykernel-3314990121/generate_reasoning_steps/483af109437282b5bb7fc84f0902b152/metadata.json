The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Unna-Thost palmoplantar keratoderma. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal dominant inheritance - Nonepidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'How might Unna-Thost palmoplantar keratoderma be treated? The following treatments can help to soften the thickened skin and make it less noticeable:  Emollients  Keratolytics (such as salicylic acid in propylene glycol) Topical retinoids Topical vitamin D ointment (calcipotriol) Systemic retinoids (acitretin) Antifungal medication may help if the condition occurs along with a fungal infection.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Symmetrical thalamic calcifications?

People with this condition are missing genetic material located on the short arm (p) of chromosome 8 in each cell. The severity of the condition and the associated signs and symptoms vary based on the size and location of the deletion and which genes are involved. Most cases are not inherited, although affected people can pass the deletion on to their children. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.']}"}, "time": 1746283461.43732}
