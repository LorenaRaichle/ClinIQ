It happens when something goes wrong with the way messages pass between your brain and muscles. Paralysis can be complete or partial. It can occur on one or both sides of your body. It can also occur in just one area, or it can be widespread. Paralysis of the lower half of your body, including both legs, is called paraplegia. Paralysis of the arms and legs is quadriplegia.     Most paralysis is due to strokes or injuries such as spinal cord injury or a broken neck. Other causes of paralysis include       - Nerve diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis    -  Autoimmune diseases such as Guillain-Barre syndrome    -  Bell's palsy, which affects muscles in the face       Polio used to be a cause of paralysis, but polio no longer occurs in the U.S.\", 'Summary : Sports can be a great way to get in shape or stay that way. Having a specific goal can be a great motivator. Physically, you need strength and endurance. Your training will vary with your sport. You would not train the same way for pole vaulting as for swimming. You might, however, cross train. Cross training simply means that you include a variety of fitness activities in your program. Research shows that cross training builds stronger bones.     Remember to listen to your body. If you frequently feel exhausted or you are in pain, you may be overdoing it. Injuries can be the result. And be sure that you use your body and your equipment safely. What you eat and drink is also important. Water is the most important nutrient for active people. Drink it before, during and after workouts.', \"Most teenage girls don't plan to get pregnant, but many do. Teen pregnancies carry extra health risks to both the mother and the baby. Often, teens don't get prenatal care soon enough, which can lead to problems later on. They have a higher risk for pregnancy-related high blood pressure and its complications. Risks for the baby include premature birth and a low birth weight.    If you're a pregnant teen, you can help yourself and your baby by       - Getting regular prenatal care    - Taking your prenatal vitamins for your health and to prevent some birth defects    - Avoiding smoking, alcohol, and drugs    - Using a condom, if you are having sex, to prevent sexually transmitted diseases that could hurt your baby\", \"Summary : Asbestos is the name of a group of minerals with long, thin fibers. It was once used widely as insulation. It also occurs in the environment. Asbestos fibers are so small you can't see them. If you disturb asbestos, the fibers can float in the air. This makes them easy to inhale, and some may become lodged in the lungs.    If you breathe in high levels of asbestos over a long period of time, the fibers can build up in the lungs. This causes scarring and inflammation, and can affect breathing. Eventually it can lead to diseases such as       - Asbestosis, or scarring of the lungs that makes it hard to breathe    - Mesothelioma, a rare cancer that affects the lining of the lungs or abdomen    - Lung cancer       Lung diseases associated with asbestos usually develop over many years. People who become ill from asbestos are usually exposed on the job over long periods of time. Smoking cigarettes increases the risk.
