Most people pass gas 13 to 21 times a day. Passing gas through the mouth is called belching or burping. Passing gas through the anus is called flatulence. Most of the time gas does not have an odor. The odor comes from bacteria in the large intestine that release small amounts of gases that contain sulfur.    Gas in the digestive tract comes from two sources: air that you swallow and the breakdown of undigested food by bacteria in the large intestine. Certain foods may cause gas. Foods that produce gas in one person may not cause gas in another.    You can reduce the amount of gas you have by       - Drinking lots of water and non-fizzy drinks    - Eating more slowly so you swallow less air when you eat    - Avoiding milk products if you have lactose intolerance       Medicines can help reduce gas or the pain and bloating caused by gas. If your symptoms still bother you, see your health care provider.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', \"If you have ever had athlete's foot or a yeast infection, you can blame a fungus. A fungus is a primitive organism. Mushrooms, mold and mildew are examples. Fungi live in air, in soil, on plants and in water. Some live in the human body. Only about half of all types of fungi are harmful.    Some fungi reproduce through tiny spores in the air. You can inhale the spores or they can land on you. As a result, fungal infections often start in the lungs or on the skin. You are more likely to get a fungal infection if you have a weakened immune system or take antibiotics.    Fungi can be difficult to kill. For skin and nail infections, you can apply medicine directly to the infected area. Oral antifungal medicines are also available for serious infections.    NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases\", 'There are many kinds of families. Some have two parents, while others have a single parent. Sometimes there is no parent and grandparents raise grandchildren. Some children live in foster families, adoptive families, or in stepfamilies.    Families are much more than groups of people who share the same genes or the same address. They should be a source of love and support. This does not mean that everyone gets along all the time. Conflicts are a part of family life. Many things can lead to conflict, such as illness, disability, addiction, job loss, school problems, and marital issues. Listening to each other and working to resolve conflicts are important in strengthening the family.', \"Summary : Screenings are tests that look for diseases before you have symptoms. Screening tests can find diseases early, when they're easier to treat. You can get some screenings in your doctor's office. Others need special equipment, so you may need to go to a different office or clinic.    Some conditions that doctors commonly screen for include       - Breast cancer and cervical cancer in women    - Colorectal cancer    - Diabetes    - High blood pressure    - High cholesterol    - Osteoporosis    - Overweight and obesity    - Prostate cancer in men       Which tests you need depends on your age, your sex, your family history, and whether you have risk factors for certain diseases. After a screening test, ask when you will get the results and whom to talk to about them.    Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality\"]}"}, "time": 1746283467.772002}
