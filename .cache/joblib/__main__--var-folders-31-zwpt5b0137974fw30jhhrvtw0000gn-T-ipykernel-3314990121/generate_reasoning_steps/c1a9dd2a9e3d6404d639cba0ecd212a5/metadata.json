Most children need at least an hour of physical activity every day. Regular exercise helps children       - Feel less stressed     - Feel better about themselves    - Feel more ready to learn in school     - Keep a healthy weight     - Build and keep healthy bones, muscles and joints     - Sleep better at night       As kids spend more time watching TV, they spend less time running and playing. Parents should limit TV, video game and computer time. Parents can set a good example by being active themselves. Exercising together can be fun for everyone. Competitive sports can help kids stay fit. Walking or biking to school, dancing, bowling and yoga are some other ways for kids to get exercise.', 'Floods are common in the United States. Weather such as heavy rain, thunderstorms, hurricanes, or tsunamis can cause flooding. Flooding can also happen when a river or stream overflows its bank, when a levee is breached, or when a dam breaks. Flash floods, which can develop quickly, often have a dangerous wall of roaring water. The wall carries rocks, mud, and rubble and can sweep away most things in its path.    Be aware of flood hazards no matter where you live, but especially if you live in a low-lying area, near water or downstream from a dam. Although there are no guarantees of safety during a flood, you can take actions to protect yourself. You should have a disaster plan. Being prepared can help reduce fear, anxiety, and losses. If you do experience a disaster, it is normal to feel stressed. You may need help in finding ways to cope.    Federal Emergency Management Agency', 'Summary : Genetic counseling provides information and support to people who have, or may be at risk for, genetic disorders. A genetic counselor meets with you to discuss genetic risks. The counseling may be for yourself or a family member. Or you may get it when you are planning or expecting a baby. You may follow up with genetic testing.     There are many reasons to seek genetic counseling. You may consider it if you        - Have a personal or family history of a genetic condition or birth defect    - Are pregnant or planning to be pregnant after age 35    - Already have a child with a genetic disorder or birth defect    - Have had two or more pregnancy losses or a baby who died    - Have had ultrasound or screening tests that suggest a possible problem       Genetics Home Reference', \"Frostbite is an injury to the body that is caused by freezing. It most often affects the nose, ears, cheeks, chin, fingers, or toes. Frostbite can permanently damage the body, and severe cases can lead to amputation.    Signs of frostbite include       - A white or grayish-yellow skin area    - Skin that feels unusually firm or waxy    - Numbness       If you have symptoms of frostbite, seek medical care. But if immediate medical care isn't available, here are steps to take:       - Get into a warm room as soon as possible.    - Unless absolutely necessary, do not walk on frostbitten feet or toes. Walking increases the damage.    - Put the affected area in warm - not hot - water.    - You can also warm the affected area using body heat. For example, use your armpit to warm frostbitten fingers.     - Don't rub the frostbitten area with snow or massage it at all. This can cause more damage.     - Don't use a heating pad, heat lamp, or the heat of a stove, fireplace, or radiator for warming. Since frostbite makes an area numb, you could burn it.
