The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Sabinas brittle hair syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Nail dystrophy 5% Autosomal recessive inheritance - Brittle hair - Dry hair - Hypotrichosis - Intellectual disability - Nail dysplasia - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Partington syndrome is a rare neurological condition that is primarily characterized by mild to moderate intellectual disability and dystonia of the hands. Other signs and symptoms may include dysarthria, behavioral abnormalities, recurrent seizures and/or an unusual gait (style of walking). Partington syndrome usually occurs in males; when it occurs in females, the signs and symptoms are often less severe. It is caused by changes (mutations) in the ARX gene and is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Partington syndrome? The signs and symptoms of Partington syndrome vary but may include: Mild to moderate intellectual disability Behavioral issues Dystonia, especially affecting the movement of the hands Dysarthria Abnormal gait (style of walking) Recurrent seizures Partington syndrome usually occurs in males; when it occurs in females, the signs and symptoms are often less severe.

In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What causes Partington syndrome? Partington syndrome is caused by changes (mutations) in the ARX gene, which encodes a protein that regulates the activity of other genes. This protein is particularly important in the developing brain where it plays many roles (i.e. assisting with the movement and communication of neurons). Specific changes in the ARX gene impair the function of the protein, which may disrupt normal neuronal migration. This can lead to the many signs and symptoms associated with Partington syndrome.']}"}, "time": 1746283458.0372858}
