The features in affected people vary. Craniosynostosis can give the head a pointed appearance; cause asymmetry of the head and face; affect the development of the brain; and cause characteristic facial features. Other signs and symptoms may include dental abnormalities; vision problems; hearing loss; heart defects; genital abnormalities; obesity; various skeletal abnormalities; and a range of intellectual disability. Carpenter syndrome can be caused by mutations in the RAB23 or MEGF8 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment focuses on the specific features in each affected person. Life expectancy is shortened but very variable.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Carpenter syndrome? The signs and symptoms of Carpenter syndrome can vary greatly, even within members of the same family. The main features include premature closure of certain skull bones (craniosynostosis), distinctive facial characteristics, and/or abnormalities of the fingers and toes (digits). People with Carpenter syndrome often have intellectual disability (from mild to profound), but some affected people have normal intelligence. Craniosynostosis prevents the skull from growing normally and can cause a pointed appearance of the head; asymmetry of the head and face; increased pressure within the skull; and characteristic facial features. Facial features may include a flat nasal bridge; down-slanting palpebral fissures (the outside corners of the eye); low-set and abnormally shaped ears; underdeveloped jaws; and abnormal eye shape. Vision problems are common. Some people also have dental abnormalities such as small baby teeth. Abnormalities of the fingers and toes may include fusion of the skin between digits; short digits; or extra digits. Other signs and symptoms may include obesity, umbilical hernia, hearing loss, heart defects, and other skeletal abnormalities such as as deformed hips, kyphoscoliosis, and knees that angle inward. Nearly all males have genital abnormalities such as undescended testes. A few affected people have organs or tissues within the torso that are in reversed positions. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Carpenter syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is an immune disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of severe swelling. The most commonly affected areas of the body are the limbs, face, intestinal tract, and airway. HAE is caused by low levels or improper function of a protein called C1 inhibitor which affects the blood vessels. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Hereditary angioedema? Hereditary angioedema is characterized by recurrent episodes of severe swelling (angioedema). The most commonly involved areas of the body are the limbs, face, intestinal tract, and airway. While minor trauma or stress may trigger an attack, swelling often occurs without a known trigger. Episodes involving the intestinal tract cause severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Swelling in the airway can restrict breathing and lead to life-threatening obstruction of the airway. About one-third of people with this condition develop a non-itchy rash called erythema marginatum during an attack. Symptoms of hereditary angioedema typically begin in childhood and worsen during puberty. Untreated individuals may have an attack every 1 to 2 weeks. Most episodes last 3 to 4 days. The frequency and duration of attacks vary greatly among individuals with hereditary angioedema, even among those in the same family.
