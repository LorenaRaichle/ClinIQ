The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Chronic myeloid leukemia. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Chronic myelogenous leukemia - Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia - Somatic mutation - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Myelocytic leukemia-like syndrome, familial, chronic?

It is characterized by episodes of poor coordination and balance (ataxia). During these episodes, many people also experience dizziness (vertigo), nausea and vomiting, migraine headaches, blurred or double vision, slurred speech, and ringing in the ears (tinnitus). Seizures, muscle weakness, and paralysis affecting one side of the body (hemiplegia) may also occur during attacks. Episodes of ataxia and other symptoms can begin anytime from early childhood to adulthood, with the frequency of attacks ranging from several per day to one or two per year. There are at least seven types of episodic ataxia, designated type 1 through type 7, which are distinguished by their signs and symptoms, age of onset, length of attacks, and, when known, genetic cause. Only types 1 and 2 have been identified in more than one family; episodic ataxia type 2 is the most common form of the condition.']}"}, "time": 1746283460.82255}
