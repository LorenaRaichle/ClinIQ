The signs and symptoms of Tietze syndrome usually develop in young adulthood (before age 40). The most common symptom is mild to severe chest pain that may extend into the arms and/or shoulders. The onset of pain can be gradual or sudden and may worsen with coughing, sneezing, or deep breathing. More than 70% of cases occur on only one side (unilateral) and affect one joint. The affected joint is typically tender and swollen. While the pain associated with Tietze syndrome usually subsides after several weeks or months, the swelling may persist.', 'What causes Tietze syndrome? The exact underlying cause of Tietze syndrome is currently unknown. Some researchers have speculated that small injuries to the anterior chest wall may contribute to the development of the condition.', 'Is Tietze syndrome inherited? Tietze syndrome is not thought to be inherited. Most cases occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition.', 'How is Tietze syndrome diagnosed? Tietze syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion. This means that a diagnosis is made in people with chest pain and swelling of the cartilage that joins the upper ribs to the breastbone (costochondral junction) after other conditions with similar signs and symptoms have been ruled out. A thorough physical exam and various tests (i.e. electrocardiogram, x-ray, CT scan) may be necessary to exclude other conditions.']}"}, "time": 1746283455.693932}
