A variation in the ITPKC gene has been associated with an increased risk of developing Kawasaki syndrome. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate 3-kinase C. This enzyme helps limit the activity of immune system cells called T cells, which identify foreign substances and defend the body against infection. Reducing the activity of T cells when appropriate prevents the overproduction of immune proteins called cytokines that lead to inflammation and can, when present in large quantities, can cause tissue damage. Researchers believe that variations in the ITPKC gene may interfere with the body's ability to reduce T cell activity, leading to inflammation that damages blood vessels and results in the symptoms of this disease. It is likely that other factors, including changes in additional genes, also influence the development of this complex disorder. What causes Kawasaki syndrome? The cause of Kawasaki syndrome isn't known. The body's response to a virus or infection combined with genetic factors may cause the disease. However, no specific virus or infection has been found, and the role of genetics is not well understood. Kawasaki syndrome is not contagious; it can't be passed from one child to another.\", 'Is Kawasaki syndrome inherited? A predisposition to Kawasaki syndrome appears to be passed through generations in families, but the inheritance pattern is unknown.', \"How might Kawasaki disease be treated? Intravenous gamma globulin is the standard treatment for Kawasaki disease and is administered in high doses. Children with Kawasaki disease usually greatly improve within 24 hours of treatment with IV gamma globulin. Aspirin is often given in combination with the IV gamma globulin as part of the treatment plan. We found limited information on the management of Kawasaki disease specifically in adults, however you may find the following articles to be helpful: Dauphin C. et al., Kawasaki disease is also a disease of adults: report of six cases. Arch Mal Coeur Vaiss [serial online]. 2007;100(5):439-447. Sve P, Stankovic K, Smail A, Durand DV, Marchand G, and Broussolle C. Adult Kawasaki disease: report of two cases and literature review. Semin Arthritis Rheum. 2005;34(6):785-792. Sve P, Bui-Xuan C, Charhon A, and Broussolle C. Adult Kawasaki disease. Rev Med Interne [serial online]. 2003;24(9):577-584.In the article listed above by Dauphin C. et al. the authors describe that of the five adult patients with Kawasaki disease who were treated, all progressed favorably after a course of immunoglobulins.  In addition, in the article by Sve P. et al., the authors comment that 'although adult KD often was diagnosed after the acute phase, when a significant beneficial effect from gammaglobulin infusion could not be expected, this treatment did appear to shorten the course of the disease.'\", 'What are the signs and symptoms of Kaplan Plauchu Fitch syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Kaplan Plauchu Fitch syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal form of the vertebral bodies 90% Abnormality of periauricular region 90% Abnormality of the fingernails 90% Abnormality of the metacarpal bones 90% Abnormality of the toenails 90% Anteverted nares 90% Cleft palate 90% Low-set, posteriorly rotated ears 90% Prominent nasal bridge 90% Proptosis 90% Ptosis 90% Short distal phalanx of finger 90% Short philtrum 90% Short stature 90% Tapered finger 90% Telecanthus 90% Triphalangeal thumb 90% Abnormality of the hip bone 50% Advanced eruption of teeth 50% Choanal atresia 50% Conductive hearing impairment 50% Craniosynostosis 50% Genu valgum 50% Hypertelorism 50% Lacrimation abnormality 50% Microcephaly 50% Myopia 50% Pectus excavatum 50% Sensorineural hearing impairment 50% Sloping forehead 50% Spina bifida occulta 50% Ulnar deviation of finger 50% Abnormal auditory evoked potentials - Abnormality of the vertebral column - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Hypotelorism - Oxycephaly - Preauricular pit - Short 1st metacarpal - Short first metatarsal - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.']}"}, "time": 1746283459.876491}
