Your body is on its way to becoming its adult size. You may notice that you can't fit into your old shoes or that your jeans are now 3 inches too short. Along with these changes, you are probably becoming more independent and making more of your own choices. Some of the biggest choices you face are about your health.    Healthy habits, including eating a healthy diet and being physically active, can help you feel good, look good, and do your best in school, work, or sports. They might also prevent diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, osteoporosis, stroke, and some cancers when you are older.\", 'Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the sudden, unexplained death of an infant younger than one year old. Some people call SIDS \"crib death\" because many babies who die of SIDS are found in their cribs.     SIDS is the leading cause of death in children between one month and one year old. Most SIDS deaths occur when babies are between two months and four months old. Premature babies, boys, African Americans, and American Indian/Alaska Native infants have a higher risk of SIDS.    Although health care professionals don\\'t know what causes SIDS, they do know ways to reduce the risk. These include       - Placing babies on their backs to sleep, even for short naps. \"Tummy time\" is for when babies are awake and someone is watching    - Using a firm sleep surface, such as a crib mattress covered with a fitted sheet     - Keeping soft objects and loose bedding away from sleep area    - Making sure babies don\\'t get too hot. Keep the room at a comfortable temperature for an adult.    - Don\\'t smoke during pregnancy or allow anyone to smoke near your baby       NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Your ankle bone and the ends of your two lower leg bones make up the ankle joint. Your ligaments, which connect bones to one another, stabilize and support it. Your muscles and tendons move it.    The most common ankle problems are sprains and fractures. A sprain is an injury to the ligaments. It may take a few weeks to many months to heal completely. A fracture is a break in a bone. You can also injure other parts of the ankle such as tendons, which join muscles to bone, and cartilage, which cushions your joints. Ankle sprains and fractures are common sports injuries.', \"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) happens when a woman's ovaries or adrenal glands produce more male hormones than normal. One result is that cysts (fluid-filled sacs) develop on the ovaries. Women who are obese are more likely to have polycystic ovary syndrome.    Symptoms of PCOS include:      - Infertility    - Pelvic pain    - Excess hair growth on the face, chest, stomach, thumbs, or toes    - Baldness or thinning hair    - Acne, oily skin, or dandruff    - Patches of thickened dark brown or black skin          Women with PCOS are at higher risk of diabetes, metabolic syndrome, heart disease, and high blood pressure. Medicines can help control the symptoms. Birth control pills help women have normal periods, reduce male hormone levels, and clear acne. Other medicines can reduce hair growth and control blood pressure and cholesterol. There is no cure.    NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development\"]}"}, "time": 1746283467.31809}
