However, the cause of patent ductus arteriosus isn't known.\\n                \\nGenetics may play a role in causing the condition. A defect in one or more genes might prevent the ductus arteriosus from closing after birth.\", 'Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a relatively common congenital heart defect in the United States.\\n                \\nThe condition occurs more often in premature infants (on average, occurring in about 8 of every 1,000 births). However, PDA also occurs in full-term infants (on average, occurring in about 2 of every 1,000 births).\\n                \\nPDA also is more common in:\\n                \\nInfants who have genetic conditions such as Down syndrome\\n                \\nInfants whose mothers had German measles (rubella) during pregnancy\\n                \\nPDA is twice as common in girls as it is in boys.', 'A heart murmur may be the only sign that a baby has patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). A heart murmur is an extra or unusual sound heard during the heartbeat. Heart murmurs also have other causes besides PDA, and most murmurs are harmless.\\n                \\nSome infants may develop signs or symptoms of volume overload on the heart and excess blood flow in the lungs.

Heart murmurs also have other causes besides PDA, and most murmurs are harmless.\\n                \\nIf a PDA is large, the infant also may develop symptoms of volume overload and increased blood flow to the lungs. If a PDA is small, it may not be diagnosed until later in childhood.\\n                \\nIf your child's doctor thinks your child has PDA, he or she may refer you to a pediatric cardiologist. This is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating heart problems in children.\\n                \\nPremature babies who have PDA may not have the same signs as full-term babies, such as heart murmurs. Doctors may suspect PDA in premature babies who develop breathing problems soon after birth.

During echo, the sound waves bounce off your childs heart. A computer converts the sound waves into pictures of the hearts structures.\\n                \\nThe test allows the doctor to clearly see any problems with the way the heart is formed or the way it's working. Echo is the most important test available to your baby's cardiologist to both diagnose a heart problem and follow the problem over time.\\n                \\nIn babies who have PDA, echo shows how big the PDA is and how well the heart is responding to it. When medical treatments are used to try to close a PDA, echo is used to see how well the treatments are working.\\n                \\nEKG (Electrocardiogram)\\n                \\nAn EKG is a simple, painless test that records the heart's electrical activity. For babies who have PDA, an EKG can show whether the heart is enlarged. The test also can show other subtle changes that can suggest the presence of a PDA.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283465.876235}
