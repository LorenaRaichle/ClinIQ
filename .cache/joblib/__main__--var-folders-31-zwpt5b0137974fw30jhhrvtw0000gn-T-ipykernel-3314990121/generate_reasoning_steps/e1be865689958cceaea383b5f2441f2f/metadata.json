The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Snyder-Robinson syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the pinna - Bifid uvula - Broad-based gait - Cleft palate - Cryptorchidism - Decreased muscle mass - Dental crowding - Dysarthria - Facial asymmetry - High, narrow palate - Hyperextensibility of the finger joints - Hypertelorism - Intellectual disability - Kyphoscoliosis - Long fingers - Long hallux - Long palm - Mandibular prognathia - Muscular hypotonia - Narrow palm - Nasal speech - Osteoporosis - Pectus carinatum - Pectus excavatum - Phenotypic variability - Recurrent fractures - Seizures - Severe Myopia - Short philtrum - Short stature - Talipes equinovarus - Tall stature - Thick lower lip vermilion - Webbed neck - Wide intermamillary distance - X-linked recessive inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Cluttering is a disorder that affects the way a person speaks. It is characterized by a rapid speaking rate and inability to maintain normally expected sound, syllable, phrase, and pausing patterns while speaking. Other symptoms may include stuttering; language or phonological errors (problems organizing sounds); and attention deficits. The disorder seems to result from disorganized speech planning, talking too fast or in spurts, or simply being unsure of what one wants to say. Therapy generally focuses on the symptoms present in each individual and may include slowing the rate of speech and clearly producing speech sounds (articulating). Articulation and language problems are often reduced if the affected individual can achieve a slower rate of speech.', 'Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type V (HSAN5) is a condition that affects the sensory nerve cells. These cells, which are also called sensory neurons, transmit information about sensations such as pain, temperature, and touch. Signs and symptoms of the condition generally develop at birth or during early infancy and may include a loss of pain and temperature sensation. Because of the inability to feel deep pain, affected people suffer repeated severe injuries such as bone fractures and joint injuries that go unnoticed. HSAN5 is caused by changes (mutations) in the NGF gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Medical management is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person and is oriented to control hyperthermia (elevated body temperature) and prevent injury.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type V? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type V.
