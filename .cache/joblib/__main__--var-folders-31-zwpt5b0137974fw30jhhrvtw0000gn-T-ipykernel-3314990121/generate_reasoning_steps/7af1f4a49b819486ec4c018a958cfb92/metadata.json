If you are underweight, overweight, or obese, you may have a higher risk of certain health problems.    About two thirds of adults in the U.S. are overweight or obese. Achieving a healthy weight can help you control your cholesterol, blood pressure and blood sugar. It might also help you prevent weight-related diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, arthritis and some cancers.     Eating too much or not being physically active enough will make you overweight. To maintain your weight, the calories you eat must equal the energy you burn. To lose weight, you must use more calories than you eat. A weight-control strategy might include       - Choosing low-fat, low-calorie foods    - Eating smaller portions    - Drinking water instead of sugary drinks    - Being physically active       Eating extra calories within a well-balanced diet can help to add weight.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Summary : Anabolic steroids are man-made substances related to male sex hormones. Doctors use anabolic steroids to treat some hormone problems in men, delayed puberty, and muscle loss from some diseases.    Bodybuilders and athletes often use anabolic steroids to build muscles and improve athletic performance. Using them this way is not legal or safe. Abuse of anabolic steroids has been linked with many health problems. They include       -  Acne    -  Breast growth and shrinking of testicles in men     - Voice deepening and growth of facial hair in women     - High blood pressure    - Heart problems, including heart attack    - Liver disease, including cancer    - Kidney damage    - Aggressive behavior        NIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse', 'Summary : A1C is a blood test for type 2 diabetes and prediabetes. It measures your average blood glucose, or blood sugar, level over the past 3 months. Doctors may use the A1C alone or in combination with other diabetes tests to make a diagnosis. They also use the A1C to see how well you are managing your diabetes. This test is different from the blood sugar checks that people with diabetes do every day.    Your A1C test result is given in percentages. The higher the percentage, the higher your blood sugar levels have been:       - A normal A1C level is below 5.7 percent    - Prediabetes is between 5.7 to 6.4 percent. Having prediabetes is a risk factor for getting type 2 diabetes. People with prediabetes may need retests every year.    - Type 2 diabetes is above 6.5 percent    - If you have diabetes, you should have the A1C test at least twice a year. The A1C goal for many people with diabetes is below 7. It may be different for you. Ask what your goal should be. If your A1C result is too high, you may need to change your diabetes care plan.       NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'A rare disease is one that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. There are nearly 7,000 rare diseases. More than 25 million Americans have one.    Rare diseases       - May involve chronic illness, disability, and often premature death    - Often have no treatment or not very effective treatment    - Are frequently not diagnosed correctly    - Are often very complex    - Are often caused by changes in genes       It can be hard to find a specialist who knows how to treat your rare disease. Disease advocacy groups, rare disease organizations, and genetics clinics may help you to find one.    NIH: National Institutes of Health']}"}, "time": 1746283466.6297028}
