The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Preaxial polydactyly type 2. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Duplication of thumb phalanx 90% Finger syndactyly 90% Opposable triphalangeal thumb 90% Preaxial hand polydactyly 90% Triphalangeal thumb 90% Duplication of phalanx of hallux 75% Preaxial foot polydactyly 75% Abnormality of the metacarpal bones 50% Postaxial hand polydactyly 50% Toe syndactyly 50% Postaxial foot polydactyly 33% Syndactyly 33% Autosomal dominant inheritance - Complete duplication of distal phalanx of the thumb - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Lactate dehydrogenase deficiency is a condition that affects how the body breaks down sugar to use as energy in cells, primarily muscle cells. There are two types of lactate dehydrogenase deficiency: lactate dehydrogenase A deficiency (sometimes called glycogen storage disease XI) and lactate dehydrogenase B deficiency. People with lactate dehydrogenase A deficiency experience fatigue, muscle pain, and cramps during exercise (exercise intolerance). People with lactate dehydrogenase B deficiency typically do not have symptoms. Lactate dehydrogenase A deficiency is caused by mutations in the LDHA gene. Lactate dehydrogenase B deficiency is caused by mutations in the LDHB gene. Both types are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.', 'Adiposis dolorosa is a rare condition characterized by the growth of multiple, painful, lipomas (benign, fatty tumors). The lipomas may occur anywhere on the body and can cause severe pain. Other symptoms may include weakness, fatigability, and mental disturbances. It usually occurs in obese, post-menopausal women, but it can also occur in men. Adiposa dolorosa is chronic and tends to be progressive. The exact cause is unknown. Most cases are sporadic (not inherited) but a few familial cases with autosomal dominant inheritance have been reported. Treatment may include weight reduction; surgical removal or liposuction of lipomas; and pain management.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Adiposis dolorosa? Adiposis dolorosa is primarily characterized by the development of muliple, painful lipomas (benign, fatty tumors). It is often associated with obesity; physical weakness and lack of energy; and various other symptoms including depression, confusion, dementia and/or epilepsy (seizures). The lipomas may occur anywhere in the body except the face and neck. The most common sites are the knees, upper thighs, back and upper arms. They may cause joint pain (arthralgia) when they are near the joints. Pain associated with the lipomas can be debilitating; it usually worsens with movement or an increase in body weight. Sparse pubic hair and underarm hair have been reported in some affected people. The condition can also be associated with early congestive heart failure, severe hypothyroidism, joint pain, flushing episodes, tremors, cyanosis, high blood pressure, headaches, and nosebleeds.
