Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome (FHCS) is treated with antibiotics, given by intravenous (IV) injection or as medication taken by mouth.  The specific antibiotic medication is determined by the type of underlying infection; that is, treatment depends on whether the infection is chlamydia or gonorrhea.  If pain continues after treatment with antibiotics, surgery (laparoscopy) may be done to remove bands of tissue (adhesions) that connect the liver to the abdominal wall and cause pain in individuals with FHCS.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Diffuse mesangial sclerosis? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Diffuse mesangial sclerosis. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis 5% Autosomal recessive inheritance - Childhood onset - Diffuse mesangial sclerosis - Nephroblastoma (Wilms tumor) - Nephrotic syndrome - Progressive - Renal insufficiency - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Autosomal recessive palmoplantar keratoderma and congenital alopecia?

The main characteristics of this syndrome are short stature, delayed bone growth, delay in expressive language, and distinct facial features. The exact cause of Floating-Harbor syndrome is not known. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.']}"}, "time": 1746283460.441445}
