Eczema is also called dermatitis. Most types cause dry, itchy skin and rashes on the face, inside the elbows and behind the knees, and on the hands and feet. Scratching the skin can cause it to turn red, and to swell and itch even more.    Eczema is not contagious. The cause is not known. It is likely caused by both genetic and environmental factors. Eczema may get better or worse over time, but it is often a long-lasting disease. People who have it may also develop hay fever and asthma.    The most common type of eczema is atopic dermatitis. It is most common in babies and children but adults can have it too. As children who have atopic dermatitis grow older, this problem may get better or go away. But sometimes the skin may stay dry and get irritated easily.    Treatments may include medicines, skin creams, light therapy, and good skin care. You can prevent some types of eczema by avoiding       - Things that irritate your skin, such as certain soaps, fabrics, and lotions    - Stress    - Things you are allergic to, such as food, pollen, and animals       NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', \"Summary : In the U.S., the government's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must approve any drug before it can be sold. This is true whether it's a prescription or an over-the-counter drug. The FDA evaluates the safety of a drug by looking at       - Side effects    - How it's manufactured    - Results of animal testing and clinical trials       The FDA also monitors a drug's safety after approval.    For you, drug safety means buying online from only legitimate pharmacies and taking your medicines correctly.\", 'A hernia happens when part of an internal organ or tissue bulges through a weak area of muscle. Most hernias are in the abdomen.    There are several types of hernias, including       -  Inguinal, in the groin. This is the the most common type.    -  Umbilical, around the belly button    -  Incisional, through a scar    -  Hiatal, a small opening in the diaphragm that allows the upper part of the stomach to move up into the chest.    -  Congenital diaphragmatic, a birth defect that needs surgery       Hernias are common. They can affect men, women, and children. A combination of muscle weakness and straining, such as with heavy lifting, might contribute. Some people are born with weak abdominal muscles and may be more likely to get a hernia.    Treatment is usually surgery to repair the opening in the muscle wall. Untreated hernias can cause pain and health problems.', 'Hemorrhoids are swollen, inflamed veins around the anus or lower rectum. They are either inside the anus or under the skin around the anus. They often result from straining to have a bowel movement. Other factors include pregnancy, aging and chronic constipation or diarrhea.    Hemorrhoids are very common in both men and women. About half of all people have hemorrhoids by age 50. The most common symptom of hemorrhoids inside the anus is bright red blood covering the stool, on toilet paper or in the toilet bowl. Symptoms usually go away within a few days.    If you have rectal bleeding you should see a doctor. You need to make sure bleeding is not from a more serious condition such as colorectal or anal cancer. Treatment may include warm baths and a cream or other medicine. If you have large hemorrhoids, you may need surgery and other treatments.     NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases']}"}, "time": 1746283466.9855008}
