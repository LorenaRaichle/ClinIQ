It is a powder that can be made into a pill or a shiny rock (called a crystal). The powder can be eaten or snorted up the nose. It can also be mixed with liquid and injected into your body with a needle. Crystal meth is smoked in a small glass pipe.    Meth at first causes a rush of good feelings, but then users feel edgy, overly excited, angry, or afraid. Meth use can quickly lead to addiction. It causes medical problems including       - Making your body temperature so high that you pass out    - Severe itching    - \"Meth mouth\" - broken teeth and dry mouth    - Thinking and emotional problems       NIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse', 'Summary : Caregivers provide help to another person in need. The person receiving care may be an adult - often a parent or a spouse - or a child with special medical needs. Some caregivers are family members. Others are paid. They do many things:       - Shop for food and cook    - Clean the house    - Pay bills    - Give medicine    - Help the person go to the toilet, bathe and dress    - Help the person eat    - Provide company and emotional support       Caregiving is hard, and caregivers of chronically ill people often feel stress. They are \"on call\" 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. If you\\'re caring for someone with mental problems like Alzheimer\\'s disease  it can be especially difficult. Support groups can help.    Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women\\'s Health', 'Myositis means inflammation of the muscles that you use to move your body. An injury, infection, or autoimmune disease can cause it. Two specific kinds are polymyositis and dermatomyositis. Polymyositis causes muscle weakness, usually in the muscles closest to the trunk of your body. Dermatomyositis causes muscle weakness, plus a skin rash.    Other symptoms of myositis may include       - Fatigue after walking or standing    - Tripping or falling    - Trouble swallowing or breathing       Doctors may use a physical exam, lab tests, imaging tests and a muscle biopsy to diagnose myositis. There is no cure for these diseases, but you can treat the symptoms. Polymyositis and dermatomyositis are first treated with high doses of a corticosteroid. Other options include medications, physical therapy, exercise, heat therapy, assistive devices, and rest.    NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', \"Summary : Every year thousands of people in the U.S. die from motor vehicle crashes. Trying to prevent these crashes is one part of motor vehicle safety. Here are some things you can do to be safer on the road:       -  Make sure your vehicle is safe and in working order    -  Use car seats for children    -  Wear your seat belt    -  Don't speed or drive aggressively    -  Don't drive impaired       Safety also involves being aware of others. Share the road with bicycles and motorcycles, and watch for pedestrians.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283467.710272}
