There are two types: group A and group B.    Group A strep causes       - Strep throat - a sore, red throat, sometimes with white spots on the tonsils    - Scarlet fever - an illness that follows strep throat. It causes a red rash on the body.    - Impetigo - a skin infection    - Toxic shock syndrome    - Cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis (flesh-eating disease)       Group B strep can cause blood infections, pneumonia and meningitis in newborns. A screening test during pregnancy can tell if you have it. If you do, I.V. antibiotics during labor can save your baby's life. Adults can also get group B strep infections, especially if they are elderly or already have health problems. Strep B can cause urinary tract infections, blood infections, skin infections and pneumonia in adults.    Antibiotics are used to treat strep infections.    NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases\", 'Your spine, or backbone, protects your spinal cord and allows you to stand and bend. Spinal stenosis causes narrowing in your spine. The narrowing puts pressure on your nerves and spinal cord and can cause pain.    Spinal stenosis occurs mostly in people older than 50. Younger people with a spine injury or a narrow spinal canal are also at risk. Diseases such as arthritis and scoliosis can cause spinal stenosis, too. Symptoms might appear gradually or not at all. They include       - Pain in your neck or back    - Numbness, weakness, cramping, or pain in your arms or legs    - Pain going down the leg    - Foot problems       Doctors diagnose spinal stenosis with a physical exam and imaging tests. Treatments include medications, physical therapy, braces, and surgery.    NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', \"Problems with the penis can cause pain and affect a man's sexual function and fertility. Penis disorders include       -  Erectile dysfunction - inability to get or keep an erection     -  Priapism - a painful erection that does not go away     -  Peyronie's disease - bending of the penis during an erection due to a hard lump called a plaque     -  Balanitis - inflammation of the skin covering the head of the penis, most often in men and boys who have not been circumcised     -  Penile cancer - a rare form of cancer, highly curable when caught early\", \"Summary : Every racial or ethnic group has specific health concerns. Differences in the health of groups can result from       - Genetics    - Environmental factors    - Access to care    - Cultural factors        On this page, you'll find links to health issues that affect Asian Americans.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283466.999342}
