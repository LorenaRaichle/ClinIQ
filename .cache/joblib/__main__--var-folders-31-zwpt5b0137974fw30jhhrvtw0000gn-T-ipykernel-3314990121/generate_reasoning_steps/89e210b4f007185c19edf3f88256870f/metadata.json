A review of the available medical literature does not currently yield information about specific diagnostic criteria for anophthalmia plus syndrome (APS). Because APS is so rarely reported, specific diagnostic criteria may not exist. Anophthalmia and/or microphthalmia with oral-facial clefting occurs in a number of known syndromes; however, the other known syndromes typically have specific other features (such as limb abnormalities, deafness or other organ anomalies). A diagnosis of APS may be considered when an individual has the signs and symptoms most commonly reported in affected individuals, but other known syndromes with overlapping features have been ruled out.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Lubinsky syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Lubinsky syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the testis 90% Cataract 90% Decreased fertility 90% Autosomal recessive inheritance - Elevated follicle stimulating hormone - Hypogonadism - Infertility - Male hypogonadism - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Chancroid is a bacterial infection that is spread through sexual contact. It is caused by a type of bacteria called Haemophilus ducreyi. Chancroid is characterized by a small bump on the genital which becomes a painful ulcer. Men may have just one ulcer, but women often develop four or more. About half of the people who are infected with a chancroid will develop enlarged inguinal lymph nodes, the nodes located in the fold between the leg and the lower abdomen. In some cases, the nodes will break through the skin and cause draining abscesses. The swollen lymph nodes and abscesses are often called buboes. Chancroid infections can be treated with antibiotics, including azithromycin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, and erythromycin. Large lymph node swellings need to be drained, either with a needle or local surgery.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Short rib-polydactyly syndrome type 3?
