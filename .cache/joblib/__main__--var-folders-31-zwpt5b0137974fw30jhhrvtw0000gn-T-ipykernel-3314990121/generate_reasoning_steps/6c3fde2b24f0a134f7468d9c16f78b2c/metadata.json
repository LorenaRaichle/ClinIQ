The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Wildervanck syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Sensorineural hearing impairment 90% Short neck 90% Vertebral segmentation defect 90% Ectopia lentis 7.5% Facial asymmetry 7.5% Facial palsy 7.5% Low posterior hairline 7.5% Meningocele 7.5% Optic atrophy 7.5% Webbed neck 7.5% Abnormality of the outer ear - Fused cervical vertebrae - Hearing impairment - Preauricular skin tag - Pseudopapilledema - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What causes Wildervanck syndrome? The exact cause of Wildervanck syndrome is not known.  It is suspected to be a polygenic condition, meaning that many genetic factors may be involved.', 'How is Wildervanck syndrome inherited? Wildervanck syndrome does not have a clear pattern of inheritance.  In most cases, only one person in a family is affected.  These cases are called isolated or sporadic because there is no family history of Wildervanck syndrome.  Because this syndrome occurs mostly in females, it is possible that this condition has X-linked dominant inheritance.  The lack of males with Wildervanck syndrome suggests that affected males have more severe features and do not survive to birth.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Chylomicron retention disease?
