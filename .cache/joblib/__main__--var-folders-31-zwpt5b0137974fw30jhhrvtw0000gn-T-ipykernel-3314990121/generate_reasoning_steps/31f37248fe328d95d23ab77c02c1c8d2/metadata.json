LGL leukemia causes a slow increase in white blood cells called T lymphocytes, or T cells, which originate in the lymph system and bone marrow and help to fight infection. This disease usually affects people in their sixties. Symptoms include anemia; low levels of platelets (thrombocytopenia) and infection-fighting neutrophils (neutropenia) in the blood; and an enlarged spleen. About one-third of patients are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. The exact cause of LGL leukemia is unknown. Doctors can diagnose this disease through a bone marrow biopsy, or by using a specialized technique in which various types of blood or bone marrow cells are separated, identified, and counted.', None, 'What are the signs and symptoms of X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Cellular immunodeficiency 90% Decreased antibody level in blood 50% Hepatomegaly 50% Lymphadenopathy 50% Lymphoma 50% Splenomegaly 50% Anemia 7.5% Fever 9/10 Splenomegaly 9/10 Hepatitis 8/9 Hypertriglyceridemia 7/8 Hypofibrinogenemia 7/8 Increased serum ferritin 7/8 Hemophagocytosis 4/9 Encephalitis - Fulminant hepatitis - Hepatic encephalopathy - IgG deficiency - Immunodeficiency - Increased IgM level - Meningitis - Pancytopenia - Recurrent pharyngitis - Reduced natural killer cell activity - Thrombocytopenia - X-linked inheritance - X-linked recessive inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Afibrinogenemia, sometimes called congenital afibrinogenemia, is an inherited blood disorder in which the blood does not clot normally. It occurs when there is a lack (deficiency) of a protein called fibrinogen (or factor I), which is needed for the blood to clot. Affected individuals may be susceptible to severe bleeding (hemorrhaging) episodes, particularly during infancy and childhood. Afibrinogenemia is thought to be transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait.']}"}, "time": 1746283461.6078}
