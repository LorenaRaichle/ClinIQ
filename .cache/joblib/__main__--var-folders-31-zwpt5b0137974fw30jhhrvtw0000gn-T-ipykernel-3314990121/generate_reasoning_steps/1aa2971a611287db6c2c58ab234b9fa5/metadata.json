It is a fee-for-service plan, meaning that the person with Medicare usually pays a fee for each service. Medicare pays its share of an approved amount up to certain limits, and the person with Medicare pays the rest. People in Original Medicare must choose and join a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan if they want to get Medicare prescription drug coverage. For more information about Original Medicare, visit http://www.medicare.gov for a free copy of \"Your Medicare Benefits.\" (Under \"Search Tools,\" select \"Find a Medicare Publication.\")', 'People who choose Original Medicare may wish to consider Medigap, a type of Medicare supplement insurance. Medigap policies are sold by private insurance companies to fill gaps in Original Medicare Plan coverage, such as out-of-pocket costs for Medicare co-insurance and deductibles, or for services not covered by Medicare. A Medigap policy only works with Original Medicare. A person who joins a Medicare Advantage Plan generally doesn\\'t need (and can\\'t use) a Medigap policy.

Medicaid is a state-run program that provides hospital and medical coverage for people with low income and little or no resources. Each state has its own rules about who is eligible and what is covered under Medicaid. Some people qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid. If you have questions about Medicaid, you can call your State Medical Assistance (Medicaid) office for more information. Visit  http://www.medicare.gov on the web.
