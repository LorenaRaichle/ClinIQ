They can also signal an increased chance of developing heart disease.', 'Cholesterol can build up in the walls of your arteries. This buildup of cholesterol is called plaque. Over time, the plaque can build up so much that the arteries become narrower. This is called atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries.
