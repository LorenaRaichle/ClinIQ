Triple A syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern,which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene and are referred to as \"carriers\" but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. When 2 carriers for the same autosomal recessive condition have a child, there is a 25% (1 in 4) chance that the child will have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) chance that the child will be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance that the child will not have the condition and not be a carrier for the condition.', 'How might triple A syndrome be treated? There is no cure for triple A syndrome at this time; treatment typically focuses on managing individual signs and symptoms of the condition. Glucocorticoid deficiency in individuals with known adrenal insufficiency (present with Addison disease) is typically treated by replacement of glucocorticoids. This may be important for avoiding an adrenal crisis and allowing for normal growth in children. In adult individuals, as well as those who have difficulty with compliance, replacing hydrocortisone with prednisone or dexamethasone is sometimes recommended. It is usually recommended that affected individuals wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace and carry the emergency medical information card supplied with it. Achalasia is typically managed with surgical correction. Individuals may be monitored for pulmonary complications (due to reflux and aspiration). Gastric acid reduction therapy in individuals with reflux after surgical intervention is usually recommended. The symptoms in individuals with achalasia may be improved partially with pneumatic dilatation (also called balloon dilation). For those who remain symptomatic after this, other surgeries may be recommended. Alacrima is typically managed by applying topical lubricants (such as artificial tears or ointments), and with punctal occlusion (a procedure used to close the tear ducts that drain tears from the eye). The symptoms of alacrima typically improve with punctal occlusion. However, this procedure is usually only done when therapy with topical lubricants is unsuccessful.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Keratoderma palmoplantar deafness? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Keratoderma palmoplantar deafness. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Palmoplantar keratoderma 90% Sensorineural hearing impairment 90% Autosomal dominant inheritance - Hearing impairment - Palmoplantar hyperkeratosis - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Sub-cortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy) is an inherited disease of the blood vessels that occurs when the thickening of blood vessel walls blocks the flow of blood to the brain. The disease primarily affects the small blood vessels in the white matter of the brain. CADASIL is characterized by migraine headaches and multiple strokes, which progresses to dementia. Other symptoms include white matter lesions throughout the brain, cognitive deterioration, seizures, vision problems, and psychiatric problems such as severe depression and changes in behavior and personality. Individuals may also be at higher risk of heart attack. Symptoms and disease onset vary widely, with signs typically appearing in the mid-30s. Some individuals may not show signs of the disease until later in life. CADASIL is caused by a change (or mutation) in a gene called NOTCH3 and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.']}"}, "time": 1746283458.2290401}
