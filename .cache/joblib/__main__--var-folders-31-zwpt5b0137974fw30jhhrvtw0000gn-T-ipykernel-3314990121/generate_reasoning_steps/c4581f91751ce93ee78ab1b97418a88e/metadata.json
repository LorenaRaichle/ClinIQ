The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Vestibulocochlear dysfunction, progressive. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Gait disturbance 90% Sensorineural hearing impairment 90% Abnormality of the nervous system - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Progressive hearing impairment - Tinnitus - Vestibular areflexia - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Onychotrichodysplasia and neutropenia?

These bacteria typically colonize (live in or on) areas of the body without causing infection. However, people who are hospitalized and receiving treatment for other conditions may be susceptible to infection, especially those with severely impaired immune systems. Factors that increase the risk for S. maltophilia infection include admission to an intensive care unit, prolonged hospitalization, HIV infection, cancer, cystic fibrosis, neutropenia, recent surgery, trauma, mechanical ventilation, and previous therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics (medications that target a wide range of bacteria). S. maltophilia bacteria are resistant to many types of antibiotics; however, most strains can be treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infection? S. maltophilia bacteria usually colonize (live in or on) areas of the body without causing infection. In these cases, people have no signs or symptoms of a bacterial infection. When present, the features of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (S. maltophilia) infections are generally related to the organ system(s) involved. The most common manifestations are pneumonia and bacteremia. Less commonly, people infected by S. maltophilia may experience endocarditis, mastoiditis, peritonitis, meningitis, soft tissue infections, wound infections, urinary tract infections, and/or eye infections.']}"}, "time": 1746283459.207927}
