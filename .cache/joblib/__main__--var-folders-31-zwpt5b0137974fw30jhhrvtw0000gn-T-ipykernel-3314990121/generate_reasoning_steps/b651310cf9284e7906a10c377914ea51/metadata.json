High blood pressure, sometimes called hypertension, happens when this force is too high. Health care workers check blood pressure readings the same way for children, teens, and adults. They use a gauge, stethoscope or electronic sensor, and a blood pressure cuff. With this equipment, they measure:\\n                \\nSystolic Pressure: blood pressure when the heart beats while pumping blood\\n                \\nDiastolic Pressure: blood pressure when the heart is at rest between beats\\n                \\nHealth care workers write blood pressure numbers with the systolic number above the diastolic number. For example:\\n                \\n\\n                \\n118/76 mmHg People read \"118 over 76\" millimeters of mercury.\\n                \\nNormal Blood Pressure\\n                \\nNormal blood pressure for adults is defined as a systolic pressure below 120 mmHg and a diastolic pressure below 80 mmHg. It is normal for blood pressures to change when you sleep, wake up, or are excited or nervous. When you are active, it is normal for your blood pressure to increase. However, once the activity stops, your blood pressure returns to your normal baseline range.\\n                \\nBlood pressure normally rises with age and body size. Newborn babies often have very low blood pressure numbers that are considered normal for babies, while older teens have numbers similar to adults.\\n                \\nAbnormal Blood Pressure\\n                \\nAbnormal increases in blood pressure are defined as having blood pressures higher than 120/80 mmHg. The following table outlines and defines high blood pressure severity levels.\\n                \\nStages of High Blood Pressure in Adults\\n                \\nThe ranges in the table are blood pressure guides for adults who do not have any short-term serious illnesses. People with diabetes or chronic kidney disease should keep their blood pressure below 130/80 mmHg.\\n                \\nAlthough blood pressure increases seen in prehypertension are less than those used to diagnose high blood pressure, prehypertension can progress to high blood pressure and should be taken seriously. Over time, consistently high blood pressure weakens and damages your blood vessels, which can lead to complications.\\n                \\nTypes of High Blood Pressure\\n                \\nThere are two main types of high blood pressure: primary and secondary high blood pressure.\\n                \\nPrimary High Blood Pressure\\n                \\nPrimary, or essential, high blood pressure is the most common type of high blood pressure. This type of high blood pressure tends to develop over years as a person ages.\\n                \\nSecondary High Blood Pressure\\n                \\nSecondary high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or use of certain medicines. This type usually resolves after the cause is treated or removed.', 'Changes, either fromgenesor the environment, in the bodys normal functions may cause high blood pressure, including changes to kidney fluid and salt balances, therenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system,sympathetic nervous systemactivity, and blood vessel structure and function.\\n                \\nBiology and High Blood Pressure\\n                \\nResearchers continue to study how various changes in normal body functions cause high blood pressure. The key functions affected in high blood pressure include:\\n                \\nKidney fluid and salt balances\\n                \\nRenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system\\n                \\nSympathetic nervous system activity\\n                \\nBlood vessel structure and function\\n                \\n\\n                \\nKidney Fluid and Salt Balances\\n                \\nThe kidneys normally regulate the bodys salt balance by retaining sodium and water and excreting potassium. Imbalances in this kidney function can expand blood volumes, which can cause high blood pressure.\\n                \\n\\n                \\nRenin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System\\n                \\nThe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system makes angiotensin and aldosterone hormones. Angiotensin narrows or constricts blood vessels, which can lead to an increase in blood pressure. Aldosterone controls how the kidneys balance fluid and salt levels. Increased aldosterone levels or activity may change this kidney function, leading to increased blood volumes and high blood pressure.\\n                \\n\\n                \\nSympathetic Nervous System Activity\\n                \\nThe sympathetic nervous system has important functions in blood pressure regulation, including heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing rate. Researchers are investigating whether imbalances in this system cause high blood pressure.\\n                \\n\\n                \\nBlood Vessel Structure and Function\\n                \\nChanges in the structure and function of small and large arteries may contribute to high blood pressure. The angiotensin pathway and the immune system may stiffen small and large arteries, which can affect blood pressure.\\n                \\n\\n                \\nGenetic Causes of High Blood Pressure\\n                \\nMuch of the understanding of the body systems involved in high blood pressure has come from genetic studies. High blood pressure often runs in families. Years of research have identified many genes and other mutations associated with high blood pressure, some in the renal salt regulatory and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathways. However, these known genetic factors only account for 2 to 3percent of all cases. Emerging research suggests that certain DNA changes during fetal development also may cause the development of high blood pressure later in life.\\n                \\nEnvironmental Causes of High Blood Pressure\\n                \\nEnvironmental causes of high blood pressure include unhealthy lifestyle habits, being overweight or obese, and medicines.\\n                \\n\\n                \\nUnhealthy Lifestyle Habits\\n                \\nUnhealthy lifestyle habits can cause high blood pressure, including:\\n                \\nHigh dietary sodium intake and sodium sensitivity\\n                \\nDrinking excess amounts of alcohol\\n                \\nLack of physical activity\\n                \\n\\n                \\nOverweight and Obesity\\n                \\nResearch studies show that being overweight or obese can increase the resistance in the blood vessels, causing the heart to work harder and leading to high blood pressure.\\n                \\n\\n                \\nMedicines\\n                \\nPrescription medicines such as asthma or hormone therapies, including birth control pills and estrogen, and over-the-counter medicines such as cold relief medicines may cause this form of high blood pressure. This happens because medicines can change the way your body controls fluid and salt balances, cause your blood vessels to constrict, or impact the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system leading to high blood pressure.\\n                \\nOther Medical Causes of High Blood Pressure\\n                \\nOther medical causes of high blood pressure include other medical conditions such as chronic kidney disease, sleep apnea, thyroid problems, or certain tumors. This happens because these other conditions change the way your body controls fluids, sodium, and hormones in your blood, which leads to secondary high blood pressure.', 'Anyone can develop high blood pressure; however, age, race or ethnicity, being overweight, gender, lifestyle habits, and a family history of high blood pressure can increase your risk for developing high blood pressure.\\n                \\nAge\\n                \\nBlood pressure tends to rise with age. About 65 percent of Americans age 60 or older have high blood pressure. However, the risk for prehypertension and high blood pressure is increasing for children and teens, possibly due to the rise in the number of overweight children and teens.\\n                \\nRace/Ethnicity\\n                \\nHigh blood pressure is more common in African American adults than in Caucasian or Hispanic American adults. Compared with these ethnic groups, African Americans:\\n                \\nTend to get high blood pressure earlier in life.\\n                \\nOften, on average, have higher blood pressure numbers.\\n                \\nAre less likely to achieve target blood pressure goals with treatment.\\n                \\nOverweight\\n                \\nYou are more likely to develop prehypertension or high blood pressure if youre overweight or obese. The terms overweight and obese refer to body weight thats greater than what is considered healthy for a certain height.\\n                \\nGender\\n                \\nBefore age 55, men are more likely than women to develop high blood pressure. After age 55, women are more likely than men to develop high blood pressure.\\n                \\nLifestyle Habits\\n                \\nUnhealthy lifestyle habits can raise your risk for high blood pressure, and they include:\\n                \\nEating too much sodium or too little potassium\\n                \\nLack of physical activity\\n                \\nDrinking too much alcohol\\n                \\nStress\\n                \\nFamily History\\n                \\nA family history of high blood pressure raises the risk of developing prehypertension or high blood pressure. Some people have a high sensitivity to sodium and salt, which may increase their risk for high blood pressure and may run in families. Genetic causes of this condition are why family history is a risk factor for this condition.', 'Because diagnosis is based on blood pressure readings, this condition can go undetected for years, as symptoms do not usually appear until the body is damaged from chronic high blood pressure.\\n                \\n\\n                \\nComplications of High Blood Pressure\\n                \\nWhen blood pressure stays high over time, it can damage the body and cause complications. Some common complications and their signs and symptoms include:\\n                \\nAneurysms:When an abnormal bulge forms in the wall of an artery. Aneurysms develop and grow for years without causing signs or symptoms until they rupture, grow large enough to press on nearby body parts, or block blood flow. The signs and symptoms that develop depend on the location of the aneurysm.\\n                \\nChronic Kidney Disease: When blood vessels narrow in the kidneys, possibly causing kidney failure.\\n                \\nCognitive Changes: Research shows that over time, higher blood pressure numbers can lead to cognitive changes. Signs and symptoms include memory loss, difficulty finding words, and losing focus during conversations.\\n                \\nEye Damage: When blood vessels in the eyes burst or bleed. Signs and symptoms include vision changes or blindness.\\n                \\nHeart Attack: When the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked and the heart doesnt get oxygen. The most common warning symptoms of a heart attack are chest pain or discomfort, upper body discomfort, and shortness of breath.\\n                \\nHeart Failure: When the heart cant pump enough blood to meet the bodys needs. Common signs and symptoms of heart failure include shortness of breath or trouble breathing; feeling tired; and swelling in the ankles, feet, legs, abdomen, and veins in the neck.\\n                \\nPeripheral Artery Disease: A disease in which plaque builds up in leg arteries and affects blood flow in the legs. When people have symptoms, the most common are pain, cramping, numbness, aching, or heaviness in the legs, feet, and buttocks after walking or climbing stairs.\\n                \\nStroke: When the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a portion of the brain is blocked. The symptoms of a stroke include sudden onset of weakness; paralysis or numbness of the face, arms, or legs; trouble speaking or understanding speech; and trouble seeing.']}"}, "time": 1746283465.856383}
