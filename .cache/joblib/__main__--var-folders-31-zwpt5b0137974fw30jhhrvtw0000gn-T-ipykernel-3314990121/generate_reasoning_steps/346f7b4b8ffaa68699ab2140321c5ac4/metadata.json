Loeys-Dietz syndrome types I and II appear to be the most common forms.', \"The four types of Loeys-Dietz syndrome are distinguished by their genetic cause: mutations in the TGFBR1 gene cause type I, mutations in the TGFBR2 gene cause type II, mutations in the SMAD3 gene cause type III, and mutations in the TGFB2 gene cause type IV. These four genes play a role in cell signaling that promotes growth and development of the body's tissues. This signaling pathway also helps with bone and blood vessel development and plays a part in the formation of the extracellular matrix, an intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells.  Mutations in the TGFBR1, TGFBR2, TGFB2, and SMAD3 genes result in the production of proteins with little or no function. Even though these proteins have severely reduced function, cell signaling occurs at an even greater intensity than normal. Researchers speculate that the activity of proteins in this signaling pathway is increased to compensate for the protein whose function is reduced; however, the exact mechanism responsible for the increase in signaling is unclear. The overactive signaling pathway disrupts the development of connective tissue, the extracellular matrix, and various body systems, leading to the varied signs and symptoms of Loeys-Dietz syndrome.\", 'Loeys-Dietz syndrome is considered to have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.  In about 75 percent of cases, this disorder results from a new gene mutation and occurs in people with no history of the disorder in their family. In other cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent.', 'These resources address the diagnosis or management of Loeys-Dietz syndrome:  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Loeys-Dietz Syndrome  - Genetic Testing Registry: Loeys-Dietz syndrome  - Genetic Testing Registry: Loeys-Dietz syndrome 1  - Genetic Testing Registry: Loeys-Dietz syndrome 2  - Genetic Testing Registry: Loeys-Dietz syndrome 3  - Genetic Testing Registry: Loeys-Dietz syndrome 4  - Johns Hopkins Medicine: Diagnosis of Craniosynostosis  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Aortic Dissection  - National Heart Lung and Blood Institute: How Is an Aneurysm Treated?
