This condition can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. Other cases may result from new mutations in the gene. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.  Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia can also be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.', 'These resources address the diagnosis or management of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia:  - Cedars-Sinai Medical Center  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Multiple Epiphyseal Dysplasia, Dominant  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Multiple Epiphyseal Dysplasia, Recessive  - Genetic Testing Registry: Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia 1  - Genetic Testing Registry: Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia 2  - Genetic Testing Registry: Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia 3  - Genetic Testing Registry: Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia 4  - Genetic Testing Registry: Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia 5  - Genetic Testing Registry: Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia 6   These resources from MedlinePlus offer information about the diagnosis and management of various health conditions:  - Diagnostic Tests  - Drug Therapy  - Surgery and Rehabilitation  - Genetic Counseling   - Palliative Care', 'Purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency is one of several disorders that damage the immune system and cause severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). People with SCID lack virtually all immune protection from foreign invaders such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Affected individuals are prone to repeated and persistent infections that can be very serious or life-threatening. These infections are often caused by \"opportunistic\" organisms that ordinarily do not cause illness in people with a normal immune system. Infants with SCID typically grow much more slowly than healthy children and experience pneumonia, chronic diarrhea, and widespread skin rashes. Without successful treatment to restore immune function, children with SCID usually do not survive past early childhood.  About two-thirds of individuals with purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency have neurological problems, which may include developmental delay, intellectual disability, difficulties with balance and coordination (ataxia), and muscle stiffness (spasticity). People with purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency are also at increased risk of developing autoimmune disorders, which occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body\\'s tissues and organs.', 'Purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency is rare; only about 70 affected individuals have been identified. This disorder accounts for approximately 4 percent of all SCID cases.']}"}, "time": 1746283449.7775621}
