Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Hall Riggs mental retardation syndrome?

The features and severity can vary greatly among affected people. Signs and symptoms may include cleft palate, heart defects, recurrent infections, unique facial characteristics, feeding problems, immune system disorders, kidney abnormalities, hypoparathyroidism, thrombocytopenia, scoliosis, hearing loss, developmental delay, and learning disabilities. People with this condition are also more likely to develop certain autoimmune disorders and personality disorders. In most cases, the syndrome occurs for the first time in the affected person; about 10% of cases are inherited from a parent. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.', \"What are the signs and symptoms of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome? Signs and symptoms of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome vary greatly from person to person, even among affected people in the same family. Symptoms may include: Heart defects (74% of individuals) Palatal abnormalities (69% of individuals) Characteristic facial features (e.g., elongated face, almond-shaped eyes, wide nose, and small ears) Learning difficulties (70-90% of individuals) Immune system problems (75% of individuals) Low levels of calcium (50% of individuals) Significant feeding problems (30% of individuals) Kidney anomalies (37% of individuals) Hearing loss Laryngotracheoesophageal anomalies Growth hormone deficiency Autoimmune disorders (e.g., thrombocytopenia, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, overactive thyroid, vitiligo, neutropenia, and hemolytic anemia) Seizures Skeletal abnormalities (e.g., extra fingers, toes, or ribs, wedge-shaped spinal bones, craniosynostosis) Psychiatric illness Eye abnormalities (e.g., ptosis, coloboma, cataract, and strabismus) Central nervous system abnormalities Gastrointestinal anomalies Preauricular tags Abnormal growths (e.g., hepatoblastoma, renal cell carcinoma, Wilm's tumor, and neuroblastoma) The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.
