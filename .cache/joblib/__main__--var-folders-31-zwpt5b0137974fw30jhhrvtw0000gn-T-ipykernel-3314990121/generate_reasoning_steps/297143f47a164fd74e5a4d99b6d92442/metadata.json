This is especially true if the relative had the cancer at a young age. If many family members have had colorectal cancer, the chances increase even more.', 'Possible signs of colorectal cancer include: - a change in the frequency of bowel movements   - diarrhea, constipation, or feeling that the bowel does not empty completely   - either bright red or very dark blood in the stool a change in the frequency of bowel movements diarrhea, constipation, or feeling that the bowel does not empty completely either bright red or very dark blood in the stool - stools that are narrower than usual  - general abdominal discomfort such as frequent gas pains, bloating, fullness, and/or cramps   - weight loss with no known reason  - constant tiredness  - vomiting stools that are narrower than usual general abdominal discomfort such as frequent gas pains, bloating, fullness, and/or cramps weight loss with no known reason constant tiredness vomiting', 'Here are some of the tools used to detect colorectal cancer. - A fecal occult blood test, or FOBT, is a test used to check for hidden blood in the stool. Sometimes cancers or polyps can bleed, and FOBT can detect small amounts of bleeding. Newer, genetically-based stool tests are proving to be more accurate than older tests.

In July 2008, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force made its strongest ever recommendation for colorectal cancer screening: it suggested that all adults between ages 50 and 75 get screened, or tested, for the disease. The task force noted that various screening tests are available, making it possible for patients and their clinicians to decide which test is best for each person.']}"}, "time": 1746283468.120695}
