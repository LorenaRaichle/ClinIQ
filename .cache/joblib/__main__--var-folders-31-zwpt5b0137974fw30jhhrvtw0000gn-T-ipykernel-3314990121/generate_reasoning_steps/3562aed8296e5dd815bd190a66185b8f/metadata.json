There is currently no cure for Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS). Treatment is tailored to the specific needs of each affected person. Ideally, treatment is managed by a multidisciplinary team of craniofacial specialists. Newborns may need special positioning or tracheostomy to manage the airway. Hearing loss may be treated with bone conduction amplification, speech therapy, and/or educational intervention. In many cases, craniofacial reconstruction is needed. Surgery may be performed to repair cleft palate, to reconstruct the jaw, or to repair other bones in the skull. The specific surgical procedures used and the age when surgery is performed depends on the severity of the abnormalities, overall health and personal preference. There are some possible treatments that are being investigated. Researchers are looking for ways to inhibit a protein called p53, which helps the body to kill off unwanted cells. In people with TCS, p53 is abnormally activated, leading to the loss of specific cells and ultimately causing features of TCS. It has been proposed that inhibiting the production of p53 (or blocking its activation) may help to treat affected people. However, more research is needed to determine if this type of treatment is effective and safe. Researchers are also studying the use of stems cells found in fat tissue to be used alongside surgery in people with TCS and other craniofacial disorders. Early studies have shown that surgical outcomes may be improved using these stem cells to help stimulate the regrowth of affected areas. However, this therapy is still experimental and controversial.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Tricho-dento-osseous syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Tricho-dento-osseous syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', \"Farber's disease is an inherited condition involving the breakdown and use of fats in the body (lipid metabolism). People with this condition have an abnormal accumulation of lipids (fat) throughout the cells and tissues of the body, particularly around the joints. Farber's disease is characterized by three classic symptoms: a hoarse voice or weak cry, small lumps of fat under the skin and in other tissues (lipogranulomas), and swollen and painful joints. Other symptoms may include difficulty breathing, an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), and developmental delay. Researchers have described seven types of Farber's disease based on their characteristic features. This condition is caused by mutations in the ASAH1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.\", \"What are the signs and symptoms of Farber's disease?
