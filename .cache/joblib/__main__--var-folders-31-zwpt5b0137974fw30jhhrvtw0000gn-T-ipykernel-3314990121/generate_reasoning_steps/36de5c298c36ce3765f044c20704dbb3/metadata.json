This gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an important role in the formation of tissues and organs during embryonic development. Studies in animals suggest that this protein is necessary for normal development of the limbs, heart, kidneys, nervous system, digestive system, and lungs. The MYCN protein regulates the activity of other genes by attaching (binding) to specific regions of DNA. On the basis of this action, this protein is called a transcription factor.  Mutations in the MYCN gene that cause Feingold syndrome prevent one copy of the gene in each cell from producing any functional MYCN protein. As a result, only half the normal amount of this protein is available to control the activity of specific genes during embryonic development. It remains unclear how a reduced amount of the MYCN protein causes the specific features of Feingold syndrome.', 'This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.', 'These resources address the diagnosis or management of Feingold syndrome:  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Feingold Syndrome 1  - Genetic Testing Registry: Feingold syndrome 1  - Genetic Testing Registry: Feingold syndrome 2  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Duodenal Atresia  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Esophageal Atresia  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Microcephaly  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Webbing of the Fingers or Toes   These resources from MedlinePlus offer information about the diagnosis and management of various health conditions:  - Diagnostic Tests  - Drug Therapy  - Surgery and Rehabilitation  - Genetic Counseling   - Palliative Care']}"}, "time": 1746283448.550784}
