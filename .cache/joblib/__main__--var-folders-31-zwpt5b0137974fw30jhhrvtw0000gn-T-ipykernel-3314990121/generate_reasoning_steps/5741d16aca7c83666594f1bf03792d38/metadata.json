Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'ADCY5-related dyskinesia is a movement disorder that is characterized by several different types of involuntary movements. Affected people generally develop sudden jerks, twitches, tremors, muscle tensing, and/or writhing movements between infancy and late adolescence. The arms, legs, neck and face are most commonly involved. Hypotonia and delayed motor milestones (i.e. crawling, walking) may also be present in more severely affected infants. As the name suggests, ADCY5-related dyskinesia is caused by changes (mutations) in the ADCY5 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person and may include medications, physical therapy, and occupational therapy.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of ADCY5-related dyskinesia ?
