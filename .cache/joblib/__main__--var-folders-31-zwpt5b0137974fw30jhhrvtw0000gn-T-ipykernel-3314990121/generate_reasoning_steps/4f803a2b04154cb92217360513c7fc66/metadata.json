These conditions greatly raise your risk for other health problems.\\n                \\nOverweight and Obesity-Related Health Problems in Adults\\n                \\nCoronary Heart Disease\\n                \\nAs your body mass index rises, so does your risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). CHD is a condition in which a waxy substance called plaque (plak) builds up inside the coronary arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart.\\n                \\nPlaque can narrow or block the coronary arteries and reduce blood flow to the heart muscle. This can cause angina (an-JI-nuh or AN-juh-nuh) or a heart attack. (Angina is chest pain or discomfort.)\\n                \\nObesity also can lead to heart failure. This is a serious condition in which your heart can\\'t pump enough blood to meet your body\\'s needs.\\n                \\nHigh Blood Pressure\\n                \\nBlood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries as theheart pumps blood. If this pressure rises and stays high over time, it can damage the body in many ways.\\n                \\nYour chances of having high blood pressure are greater if you\\'re overweight or obese.\\n                \\nStroke\\n                \\nBeing overweight or obese can lead to a buildup of plaque in your arteries. Eventually, an area of plaque can rupture, causing a blood clot to form.\\n                \\nIf the clot is close to your brain, it can block the flow of blood and oxygen to your brain and cause a stroke. The risk of having a stroke rises as BMI increases.\\n                \\nType 2 Diabetes\\n                \\nDiabetes is a disease in which the body\\'s blood glucose, or blood sugar, level is too high. Normally, the body breaks down food into glucose and then carries it to cells throughout the body. The cells use a hormone called insulin to turn the glucose into energy.\\n                \\nIn type 2 diabetes, the body\\'s cells don\\'t use insulin properly. At first, the body reacts by making more insulin. Over time, however, the body can\\'t make enough insulin to control its blood sugar level.\\n                \\nDiabetes is a leading cause of early death, CHD, stroke, kidney disease, and blindness. Most people who have type 2 diabetes are overweight.\\n                \\nAbnormal Blood Fats\\n                \\nIf you\\'re overweight or obese, you\\'re at increased risk of having abnormal levels of blood fats. These include high levels of triglycerides and LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol and low levels of HDL (\"good\") cholesterol.\\n                \\nAbnormal levels of these blood fats are a risk factor for CHD. For more information about triglycerides and LDL and HDL cholesterol, go to the Health Topics High Blood Cholesterol article.\\n                \\nMetabolic Syndrome\\n                \\nMetabolic syndrome is the name for a group of risk factors that raises your risk for heart disease and other health problems, such as diabetes and stroke.\\n                \\nYou can develop any one of these risk factors by itself, but they tend to occur together. A diagnosis of metabolic syndrome is made if you have at least three of the following risk factors:\\n                \\nA large waistline. This is called abdominal obesity or \"having an apple shape.\" Having extra fat in the waist area is a greater risk factor for CHD than having extra fat in other parts of the body, such as on the hips.\\n                \\nA higher than normal triglyceride level (or you\\'re on medicine to treat high triglycerides).\\n                \\nA lower than normal HDL cholesterol level (or you\\'re on medicine to treat low HDL cholesterol).\\n                \\nHigher than normal blood pressure (or you\\'re on medicine to treat high blood pressure).\\n                \\nHigher than normal fasting blood sugar (or you\\'re on medicine to treat diabetes).\\n                \\nCancer\\n                \\nBeing overweight or obese raises your risk for colon, breast, endometrial, and gallbladder cancers.\\n                \\nOsteoarthritis\\n                \\nOsteoarthritis is a common joint problem of the knees, hips, and lower back. The condition occurs if the tissue that protects the joints wears away. Extra weight can put more pressure and wear on joints, causing pain.\\n                \\nSleep Apnea\\n                \\nSleep apnea is a common disorder in which you have one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep.\\n                \\nA person who has sleep apnea may have more fat stored around the neck. This can narrow the airway, making it hard to breathe.\\n                \\nObesity Hypoventilation Syndrome\\n                \\nObesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is a breathing disorder that affects some obese people. In OHS, poor breathing results in too much carbon dioxide (hypoventilation) and too little oxygen in the blood (hypoxemia).\\n                \\nOHS can lead to serious health problems and may even cause death.\\n                \\nReproductive Problems\\n                \\nObesity can cause menstrual issues and infertility in women.\\n                \\nGallstones\\n                \\nGallstones are hard pieces of stone-like material that form in the gallbladder. They\\'re mostly made of cholesterol. Gallstones can cause stomach or back pain.\\n                \\nPeople who are overweight or obese are at increased risk of having gallstones. Also, being overweight may result in an enlarged gallbladder that doesn\\'t work well.\\n                \\nOverweight and Obesity-Related Health Problems in Children and Teens\\n                \\nOverweight and obesity also increase the health risks for children and teens. Type2 diabetes once was rare in American children, but an increasing number of children are developing the disease.\\n                \\nAlso, overweight children are more likely to become overweight or obese as adults, with the same disease risks.', 'Overweight and obesity affect Americans of all ages, sexes, and racial/ethnic groups. This serious health problem has been growing over the last 30 years.\\n                \\nAdults\\n                \\nAccording to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 20092010, almost 70 percent of Americans are overweight or obese. The survey also shows differences in overweight and obesity among racial/ethnic groups.\\n                \\nIn women, overweight and obesity are highest among non-Hispanic Black women (about 82percent), compared with about 76 percent for Hispanic women and 64 percent for non-Hispanic White women.\\n                \\nIn men, overweight and obesity are highest among Hispanic men (about 82percent), compared with about 74 percent for non-Hispanic White men and about 70 percent for non-Hispanic Black men.\\n                \\nChildren and Teens\\n                \\nChildren also have become heavier. In the past 30 years, obesity has tripled among school-aged children and teens.\\n                \\nAccording to NHANES 20092010, about 1 in 6 American children ages 219 are obese. The survey also suggests that overweight and obesity are having a greater effect on minority groups, including Blacks and Hispanics.', 'Weight gain usually happens over time. Most people know when they\\'ve gained weight. Some of the signs of overweight or obesity include:\\n                \\nClothes feeling tight and needing a larger size.\\n                \\nThe scale showing that you\\'ve gained weight.\\n                \\nHaving extra fat around the waist.\\n                \\nA higher than normal body mass index and waist circumference. (For more information, go to \"How Are Overweight and Obesity Diagnosed?\")', \"The most common way to find out whether you're overweight or obese is to figure out your body mass index (BMI). BMI is an estimate of body fat, and it's a good gauge of your risk for diseases that occur with more body fat.\\n                \\nBMI is calculated from your height and weight. You can use the chart below or the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI's) online BMI calculator to figure out your BMI. Or, you health care provider can measure your BMI.\\n                \\nBody Mass Index for Adults\\n                \\nUse this table to learn your BMI. First, find your height on the far left column. Next, move across the row to find your weight. Weight is measured with underwear but no shoes.\\n                \\nOnce you've found your weight, move to the very top of that column. This number is your BMI.\\n                \\nThis table offers a sample of BMI measurements. If you don't see your height and/or weight listed on this table, go the NHLBI's complete Body Mass Index Table.\\n                \\nWhat Does Body Mass Index Mean? \\n                \\nAlthough BMI can be used for most men and women, it does have some limits. It may overestimate body fat in athletes and others who have a muscular build. BMI also may underestimate body fat in older people and others who have lost muscle.\\n                \\nBody Mass Index for Children and Teens\\n                \\nOverweight are obesity are defined differently for children and teens than for adults. Children are still growing, and boys and girls mature at different rates.\\n                \\nBMIs for children and teens compare their heights and weights against growth charts that take age and sex into account. This is called BMI-for-age percentile. A child or teen's BMI-for-age percentile shows how his or her BMI compares with other boys and girls of the same age.\\n                \\nFor more information about BMI-for-age and growth charts for children, go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's BMI-for-age calculator.\\n                \\nWhat Does the BMI-for-Age Percentile Mean?\\n                \\nWaist Circumference\\n                \\nHealth care professionals also may take your waist measurement. This helps screen for the possible health risks related to overweight and obesity in adults.\\n                \\nIf you have abdominal obesity and most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, you're at increased risk for coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes. The risk goes up with a waist size that's greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40inches for men.\\n                \\nYou also can measure your waist size. To do so correctly, stand and place a tape measure around your middle, just above your hipbones. Measure your waist just after you breathe out.\\n                \\nSpecialists Involved\\n                \\nA primary care doctor (or pediatrician for children and teens) will assess your BMI, waist measurement, and overall health risk. If you're overweight or obese, or if you have a large waist size, your doctor should explain the health risks and find out whether you're interested and willing to lose weight.\\n                \\nIf you are, you and your doctor can work together to create a treatment plan. The plan may include weight-loss goals and treatment options that are realistic for you.\\n                \\nYour doctor may send you to other health care specialists if you need expert care. These specialists may include:\\n                \\nAn endocrinologist if you need to be treated for type 2 diabetes or a hormone problem, such as an underactive thyroid.\\n                \\nA registered dietitian or nutritionist to work with you on ways to change your eating habits.\\n                \\nAn exercise physiologist or trainer to figure out your level of fitness and show you how to do physical activities suitable for you.\\n                \\nA bariatric surgeon if weight-loss surgery is an option for you.\\n                \\nA psychiatrist, psychologist, or clinical social worker to help treat depression or stress.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283466.062203}
