However, they can develop over hours or even days.\\n                \\nThe type of symptoms depends on the type of stroke and the area of the brain thats affected. How long symptoms last and how severe they are vary among different people.\\n                \\nSigns and symptoms of a stroke may include:\\n                \\nSudden weakness\\n                \\nParalysis (an inability to move) or numbness of the face, arms, or legs, especially on one side of the body\\n                \\nConfusion\\n                \\nTrouble speaking or understanding speech\\n                \\nTrouble seeing in one or both eyes\\n                \\nProblems breathing\\n                \\nDizziness, trouble walking, loss of balance or coordination, and unexplained falls\\n                \\nLoss of consciousness\\n                \\nSudden and severe headache\\n                \\nA transient ischemic attack (TIA) has the same signs and symptoms as a stroke. However, TIA symptoms usually last less than 12 hours (although they may last up to 24 hours). A TIA may occur only once in a persons lifetime or more often.\\n                \\nAt first, it may not be possible to tell whether someone is having a TIA or stroke. All stroke-like symptoms require medical care.\\n                \\nIf you think you or someone else is having a TIA or stroke, call 911 right away. Do not drive to the hospital or let someone else drive you. Call an ambulance so that medical personnel can begin life-saving treatment on the way to the emergency room. During a stroke, every minute counts.\\n                \\nStroke Complications\\n                \\nAfter youve had a stroke, you may develop other complications, such as:\\n                \\nBlood clots and muscle weakness. Being immobile (unable to move around) for a long time can raise your risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs. Being immobile also can lead to muscle weakness and decreased muscle flexibility.\\n                \\nProblems swallowing and pneumonia. If a stroke affects the muscles used for swallowing, you may have a hard time eating or drinking. You also may be at risk of inhaling food or drink into your lungs. If this happens, you may develop pneumonia.\\n                \\nLoss of bladder control. Some strokes affect the muscles used to urinate. You may need a urinary catheter (a tube placed into the bladder) until you can urinate on your own. Use of these catheters can lead to urinary tract infections. Loss of bowel control or constipation also may occur after a stroke.', \"Your doctor will diagnose a stroke based on your signs and symptoms, your medical history, a physical exam, and test results.\\n                \\nYour doctor will want to find out the type of stroke youve had, its cause, the part of the brain that's affected, and whether you have bleeding in the brain.\\n                \\nIf your doctor thinks youve had a transient ischemic attack (TIA), he or she will look for its cause to help prevent a future stroke.\\n                \\nMedical History and Physical Exam\\n                \\nYour doctor will ask you or a family member about your risk factors for stroke. Examples of risk factors include high blood pressure, smoking, heart disease, and a personal or family history of stroke. Your doctor also will ask about your signs and symptoms and when they began.\\n                \\nDuring the physical exam, your doctor will check your mental alertness and your coordination and balance. He or she will check for numbness or weakness in your face, arms, and legs; confusion; and trouble speaking and seeing clearly.\\n                \\nYour doctor will look for signs of carotid artery disease, a common cause of ischemic stroke. He or she will listen to your carotid arteries with a stethoscope. A whooshing sound called a bruit (broo-E) may suggest changed or reduced blood flow due to plaque buildup in the carotid arteries.\\n                \\nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\\n                \\nYour doctor may recommend one or more of the following tests to diagnose a stroke or TIA.\\n                \\nBrain Computed Tomography\\n                \\nA brain computed tomography (to-MOG-rah-fee) scan, or brain CT scan, is a painless test that uses x rays to take clear, detailed pictures of your brain. This test often is done right after a stroke is suspected.\\n                \\nA brain CT scan can show bleeding in the brain or damage to the brain cells from a stroke. The test also can show other brain conditions that may be causing your symptoms.\\n                \\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging\\n                \\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses magnets and radio waves to create pictures of the organs and structures in your body. This test can detect changes in brain tissue and damage to brain cells from a stroke.\\n                \\nAn MRI may be used instead of, or in addition to, a CT scan to diagnose a stroke.\\n                \\nComputed Tomography Arteriogram and Magnetic Resonance Arteriogram\\n                \\nA CT arteriogram (CTA) and magnetic resonance arteriogram (MRA) can show the large blood vessels in the brain. These tests may give your doctor more information about the site of a blood clot and the flow of blood through your brain.\\n                \\nCarotid Ultrasound\\n                \\nCarotid ultrasound is a painless and harmless test that uses sound waves to create pictures of the insides of your carotid arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your brain.\\n                \\nCarotid ultrasound shows whether plaque has narrowed or blocked your carotid arteries.\\n                \\nYour carotid ultrasound test may include a Doppler ultrasound. Doppler ultrasound is a special test that shows the speed and direction of blood moving through your blood vessels.\\n                \\nCarotid Angiography\\n                \\nCarotid angiography (an-jee-OG-ra-fee) is a test that uses dye and special x rays to show the insides of your carotid arteries.\\n                \\nFor this test, a small tube called a catheter is put into an artery, usually in the groin (upper thigh). The tube is then moved up into one of your carotid arteries.\\n                \\nYour doctor will inject a substance (called contrast dye) into the carotid artery. The dye helps make the artery visible on x-ray pictures.\\n                \\nHeart Tests\\n                \\nEKG (Electrocardiogram)\\n                \\nAn EKG is a simple, painless test that records the heart's electrical activity. The test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through each part of the heart.\\n                \\nAn EKG can help detect heart problems that may have led to a stroke. For example, the test can help diagnose atrial fibrillation or a previous heart attack.\\n                \\nEchocardiography\\n                \\nEchocardiography (EK-o-kar-de-OG-ra-fee), or echo, is a painless test that uses sound waves to create pictures of your heart.\\n                \\nThe test gives information about the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart's chambers and valves are working.\\n                \\nEcho can detect possible blood clots inside the heart and problems with the aorta. The aorta is the main artery that carries oxygen-rich blood from your heart to all parts of your body.\\n                \\nBlood Tests\\n                \\nYour doctor also may use blood tests to help diagnose a stroke.\\n                \\nA blood glucose test measures the amount of glucose (sugar) in your blood. Low blood glucose levels may cause symptoms similar to those of a stroke.\\n                \\nA platelet count measures the number of platelets in your blood. Blood platelets are cell fragments that help your blood clot. Abnormal platelet levels may be a sign of a bleeding disorder (not enough clotting) or a thrombotic disorder (too much clotting).\\n                \\nYour doctor also may recommend blood tests to measure how long it takes for your blood to clot. Two tests that may be used are called PT and PTT tests. These tests show whether your blood is clotting normally.\", 'Treatment for a stroke depends on whether it is ischemic or hemorrhagic. Treatment for a transient ischemic attack (TIA) depends on its cause, how much time has passed since symptoms began, and whether you have other medical conditions.\\n                \\nStrokes and TIAs are medical emergencies. If you have stroke symptoms, call 911 right away. Do not drive to the hospital or let someone else drive you. Call an ambulance so that medical personnel can begin lifesaving treatment on the way to the emergency room. During a stroke, every minute counts.\\n                \\nOnce you receive immediate treatment, your doctor will try to treat your stroke risk factors and prevent complications by recommending heart-healthy lifestyle changes.\\n                \\nTreating an Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack\\n                \\nAn ischemic stroke or TIA occurs if an artery that supplies oxygen-rich blood to the brain becomes blocked. Often, blood clots cause the blockages that lead to ischemic strokes and TIAs. Treatment for an ischemic stroke or TIA may include medicines and medical procedures.\\n                \\nMedicines\\n                \\nIf you have a stroke caused by a blood clot, you may be given a clot-dissolving, or clot-busting, medication called tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). A doctor will inject tPA into a vein in your arm. This type of medication must be given within 4hours of symptom onset. Ideally, it should be given as soon as possible. The sooner treatment begins, the better your chances of recovery. Thus, its important to know the signs and symptoms of a stroke and to call 911 right away for emergency care.\\n                \\nIf you cant have tPA for medical reasons, your doctor may give you antiplatelet medicine that helps stop platelets from clumping together to form blood clots or anticoagulant medicine (blood thinner) that keeps existing blood clots from getting larger. Two common medicines are aspirin and clopidogrel.\\n                \\nMedical Procedures\\n                \\nIf you have carotid artery disease, your doctor may recommend a carotid endarterectomy or carotid arteryangioplasty. Both procedures open blocked carotid arteries.\\n                \\nResearchers are testing other treatments for ischemic stroke, such as intra-arterial thrombolysis and mechanical clot removal in cerebral ischemia (MERCI).\\n                \\nIn intra-arterial thrombolysis, a long flexible tube called a catheter is put into your groin (upper thigh) and threaded to the tiny arteries of the brain. Your doctor can deliver medicine through this catheter to break up a blood clot in the brain.\\n                \\nMERCI is a device that can remove blood clots from an artery. During the procedure, a catheter is threaded through a carotid artery to the affected artery in the brain. The device is then used to pull the blood clot out through the catheter.\\n                \\nTreating a Hemorrhagic Stroke\\n                \\nA hemorrhagic stroke occurs if an artery in the brain leaks blood or ruptures. The first steps in treating a hemorrhagic stroke are to find the cause of bleeding in the brain and then control it. Unlike ischemic strokes, hemorrhagic strokes arent treated with antiplatelet medicines and blood thinners because these medicines can make bleeding worse.\\n                \\nIf youre taking antiplatelet medicines or blood thinners and have a hemorrhagic stroke, youll be taken off the medicine. If high blood pressure is the cause of bleeding in the brain, your doctor may prescribe medicines to lower your blood pressure. This can help prevent further bleeding.\\n                \\nSurgery also may be needed to treat a hemorrhagic stroke. The types of surgery used include aneurysm clipping, coil embolization, and arteriovenous malformation (AVM) repair.\\n                \\nAneurysm Clipping and Coil Embolization\\n                \\nIf an aneurysm (a balloon-like bulge in an artery) is the cause of a stroke, your doctor may recommend aneurysm clipping or coil embolization.\\n                \\nAneurysm clipping is done to block off the aneurysm from the blood vessels in the brain. This surgery helps prevent further leaking of blood from the aneurysm. It also can help prevent the aneurysm from bursting again.During the procedure, a surgeon will make an incision (cut) in the brain and place a tiny clamp at the base of the aneurysm. Youll be given medicine to make you sleep during the surgery. After the surgery, youll need to stay in the hospitals intensive care unit for a few days.\\n                \\nCoil embolization is a less complex procedure for treating an aneurysm. The surgeon will insert a tube called a catheter into an artery in the groin. He or she will thread the tube to the site of the aneurysm.Then, a tiny coil will be pushed through the tube and into the aneurysm. The coil will cause a blood clot to form, which will block blood flow through the aneurysm and prevent it from burstingagain.Coil embolization is done in a hospital. Youll be given medicine to make you sleep during thesurgery.\\n                \\nArteriovenous Malformation Repair\\n                \\nIf an AVM is the cause of a stroke, your doctor may recommend an AVM repair. (An AVM is a tangle of faulty arteries and veins that can rupture within the brain.) AVM repair helps prevent further bleeding in the brain.\\n                \\nDoctors use several methods to repair AVMs. These methods include:\\n                \\nInjecting a substance into the blood vessels of the AVM to block blood flow\\n                \\nSurgery to remove the AVM\\n                \\nUsing radiation to shrink the blood vessels of the AVM\\n                \\nTreating Stroke Risk Factors\\n                \\nAfter initial treatment for a stroke or TIA, your doctor will treat your risk factors. He or she may recommend heart-healthy lifestyle changes to help control your risk factors.\\n                \\nHeart-healthy lifestyle changes may include:\\n                \\nheart-healthy eating\\n                \\nmaintaining a healthy weight\\n                \\nmanaging stress\\n                \\nphysical activity\\n                \\nquitting smoking\\n                \\nIf lifestyle changes arent enough, you may need medicine to control your risk factors.\\n                \\nHeart-Healthy Eating\\n                \\nYour doctor may recommend heart-healthy eating, which should include:\\n                \\nFat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk\\n                \\nFish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week\\n                \\nFruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes\\n                \\nLegumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans\\n                \\nVegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots\\n                \\nWhole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas\\n                \\nWhen following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating:\\n                \\nA lot of red meat\\n                \\nPalm and coconut oils\\n                \\nSugary foods and beverages\\n                \\nTwo nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise:\\n                \\nSaturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals\\n                \\nTrans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats and meats.\\n                \\nSaturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5percent to 6percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples:\\n                \\n1,200 calories a day\\n                \\n8 grams of saturated fat a day\\n                \\n1,500 calories a day\\n                \\n10 grams of saturated fat a day\\n                \\n1,800 calories a day\\n                \\n12 grams of saturated fat a day\\n                \\n2,000 calories a day\\n                \\n13 grams of saturated fat a day\\n                \\n2,500 calories a day\\n                \\n17 grams of saturated fat a day\\n                \\nNot all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterol levels. Some sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are:\\n                \\nAvocados\\n                \\nCorn, sunflower, and soybean oils\\n                \\nNuts and seeds, such as walnuts\\n                \\nOlive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils\\n                \\nPeanut butter\\n                \\nSalmon and trout\\n                \\nTofu\\n                \\nSodium\\n                \\nTry to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.\\n                \\nDietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension\\n                \\nYour doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt.\\n                \\nThe DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH.\\n                \\nAlcohol\\n                \\nTry to limit alcohol intake. Too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain.\\n                \\nMen should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is:\\n                \\n12 ounces of beer\\n                \\n5 ounces of wine\\n                \\n1 ounces of liquor\\n                \\nMaintaining a Healthy Weight\\n                \\nMaintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for stroke. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active.\\n                \\nKnowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBI) online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI:\\n                \\nBelow 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.\\n                \\nBetween 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range.\\n                \\nBetween 25.0 and 29.9 is considered overweight.\\n                \\nOf 30.0 or higher is considered obese.\\n                \\nA general goal to aim for is a BMI of less than 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal.\\n                \\nMeasuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type2 diabetes. This risk may be high with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk.\\n                \\nIf youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol.\\n                \\nManaging Stress\\n                \\nLearning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as:\\n                \\nA stress management program\\n                \\nMeditation\\n                \\nPhysical activity\\n                \\nRelaxation therapy\\n                \\nTalking things out with friends or family\\n                \\nPhysical Activity\\n                \\nRegular physical activity can lower many risk factors for stroke.\\n                \\nEveryone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1hour and 15minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10minutes at a time spread throughout the week.\\n                \\nTalk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.\\n                \\nRead more about physical activity at:\\n                \\nPhysical Activity and Your Heart\\n                \\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans\\n                \\nQuitting Smoking\\n                \\nIf you smoke or use tobacco, quit. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels and raise your risk for stroke. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.
