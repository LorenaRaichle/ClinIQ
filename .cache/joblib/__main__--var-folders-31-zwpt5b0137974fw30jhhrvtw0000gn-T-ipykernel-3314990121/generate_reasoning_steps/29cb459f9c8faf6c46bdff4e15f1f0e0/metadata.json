The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, familial, 4. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Muscular hypotonia 5% Seizures 5% Anemia 7/7 Hepatomegaly 7/7 Hypertriglyceridemia 5/5 Splenomegaly 7/7 Hemophagocytosis 6/7 Thrombocytopenia 6/7 Increased serum ferritin 3/4 Neutropenia 5/7 Hypofibrinogenemia 3/5 Autosomal recessive inheritance - Fever - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Pudendal neuralgia occurs when the pudendal nerve is injured or compressed.  Symptoms include pain, burning, tingling, or numbness in the pelvic or buttock areas; symptoms worsen while an affected individual is in a sitting position.  The cause of pudendal neuralgia is unknown.  Treatment includes nerve block of the pudendal nerve or surgery to remove surrounding tissues that might be pressing on the nerve.', 'What treatments are available for pudendal neuralgia? There are no established guidelines for the treatment of pudendal neuralgia.  Treatment may include medications, the use of a specialized cushion while sitting, nerve block, surgery to remove nearby tissues that may be pressing on the pudendal nerve, or nerve stimulation.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Leber congenital amaurosis 10?
