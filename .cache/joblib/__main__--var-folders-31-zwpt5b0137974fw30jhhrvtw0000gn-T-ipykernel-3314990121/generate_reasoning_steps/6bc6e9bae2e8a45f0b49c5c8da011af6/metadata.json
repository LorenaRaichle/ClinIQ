In childhood, treatment for aniridia focuses on regular eye examinations including necessary corrective lenses, tinted lenses to reduce light sensitivity, and occlusion therapy to address vision abnormalities. Children with Wilms tumor-aniridia-genital anomalies-retardation (WAGR) syndrome require regular renal ultrasounds, hearing tests and evaluation by a pediatric oncologist.  Additional treatment is adapted to each individual depending on the associated complications.', 'Gliomatosis cerebri is a type of brain cancer.  It is a variant form of glioblastoma multiforme. It is characterized by scattered and widespread tumor cells that can cause the cerebrum, cerebellum, or brain stem to enlarge. Signs and symptoms may include personality changes, memory disturbance, headache, hemiparesis, and seizures.  Because this tumor is so diffuse it can be challenging to treat and the prognosis for people with gliomatosis cerebri is generally poor.', 'Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is a disorder characterized by muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy). This condition gets its name from the areas of the body that are affected most often: muscles in the face (facio-), around the shoulder blades (scapulo-), and in the upper arms (humeral). The signs and symptoms of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy usually appear in adolescence. However, the onset and severity of the condition varies widely. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy results from a deletion of genetic material from a region of DNA known as D4Z4. This region is located near one end of chromosome 4. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) EMG abnormality 90% Hyperlordosis 90% Mask-like facies 90% Skeletal muscle atrophy 90% Abnormality of the eyelashes 50% Palpebral edema 50% Sensorineural hearing impairment 50% Abnormality of the retinal vasculature 7.5% Dysphagia 5% Abdominal wall muscle weakness - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Calf muscle hypertrophy - Childhood onset - Elevated serum creatine phosphokinase - External ophthalmoplegia - Exudative retinal detachment - Facial palsy - Intellectual disability - Restrictive respiratory insufficiency - Retinal telangiectasia - Scapular winging - Scapulohumeral muscular dystrophy - Seizures - Shoulder girdle muscle atrophy - Shoulder girdle muscle weakness - Slow progression - Tongue atrophy - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.']}"}, "time": 1746283454.544456}
