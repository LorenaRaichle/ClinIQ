But the outlook for people with HIV/AIDS is improving. If you are infected with HIV, there are many things you can do to help ensure you have a longer, healthier life. One important thing is to take your medicines. Make sure you have a health care provider who knows how to treat HIV. You may want to join a support group. Learn as much as you can about your disease and its treatment.

Acute pain lets you know that you may be injured or have a problem you need to take care of. Chronic pain is different. The pain signals go on for weeks, months, or even years. The original cause may have been an injury or infection. There may be an ongoing cause of pain, such as arthritis or cancer. But in some cases there is no clear cause.    Problems that cause chronic pain include       - Headache    - Low back strain    - Cancer    - Arthritis    - Pain from nerve damage       Chronic pain usually cannot be cured. But treatments can help. They include medicines, acupuncture, electrical stimulation and surgery. Other treatments include psychotherapy, relaxation and meditation therapy, biofeedback, and behavior modification.     NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Summary : People can lose all or part of an arm or leg for a number of reasons. Common ones include       - Problems with blood circulation. These may be the result of atherosclerosis or diabetes. Severe cases may result in amputation.    - Injuries, including from traffic accidents and military combat    - Cancer    - Birth defects       Some amputees have phantom pain, which is the feeling of pain in the missing limb. Other physical problems include surgical complications and skin problems, if you wear an artificial limb. Many amputees use an artificial limb. Learning how to use it takes time. Physical therapy can help you adapt.    Recovery from the loss of a limb can be hard. Sadness, anger, and frustration are common. If you are having a tough time, talk to your doctor. Treatment with medicine or counseling can help.', 'Meningococci are a type of bacteria that cause serious infections. The most common infection is meningitis, which is an inflammation of the thin tissue that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Meningococci can also cause other problems, including a serious bloodstream infection called sepsis.    Meningococcal infections can spread from person to person. Risk factors include       - Age - it is more common in infants, teens, and young adults    - Living in close quarters, such as in college dorms or military settings    - Certain medical conditions, such as not having a spleen    - Travel to areas where meningococcal disease is common       In its early stages, you may have flu-like symptoms and a stiff neck. But the disease can progress quickly and can be fatal. Early diagnosis and treatment are extremely important. Lab tests on your blood and cerebrospinal fluid can tell if you have it. Treatment is with antibiotics. Since the infection spreads from person to person, family members may also need to be treated.    A vaccine can prevent meningococcal infections.']}"}, "time": 1746283466.680945}
