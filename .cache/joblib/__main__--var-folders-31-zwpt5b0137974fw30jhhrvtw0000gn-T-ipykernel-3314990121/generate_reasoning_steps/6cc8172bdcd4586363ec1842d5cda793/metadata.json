The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Small cell carcinoma of the bladder. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Hematuria 90% Urinary tract neoplasm 90% Abdominal pain 7.5% Hypercalcemia 7.5% Recurrent urinary tract infections 7.5% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Infantile-onset ascending hereditary spastic paralysis is a motor neuron disease characterized by progressive weakness and stiffness of muscles in the arms, legs, and face. Initial symptoms usually occur within the first 2 years of life and include weakness of the legs, leg muscles that are abnormally tight and stiff, and eventual paralysis of the legs. Over time, muscle weakness and stiffness travels up (ascends) the body from the legs to the head. Infantile-onset ascending hereditary spastic paralysisis caused by mutations in the ALS2 gene, and this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Infantile-onset ascending hereditary spastic paralysis?

Affected people may experience some of the following features: overgrowth of the bones, skin, and other tissues; hamartomas; abnormalities of the skin, blood vessels (vascular tissue) and fat (adipose tissue); and distinctive facial features. Approximately 50% of people with Proteus-like syndrome are found to have changes (mutations) in the PTEN gene. In these cases, the inheritance is autosomal dominant. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.']}"}, "time": 1746283459.6986089}
