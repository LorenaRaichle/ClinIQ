A 15q11.2 microdeletion may occur randomly for the first time in an affected person (a de novo mutation), or it may be inherited from a parent with the microdeletion. A blood test to look at the parents' chromosomes is needed to find out how the microdeletion occurred. When a 15q11.2 microdeletion occurs as a de novo mutation, it is due to a random error - either during the formation of a parent's egg or sperm cell, or very soon after conception (fertilization of the egg). A parent with the microdeletion has a 50% chance with each pregnancy to pass on the microdeletion. The features of 15q11.2 microdeletion occur because the deleted region of the chromosome contains several genes that are important for normal growth and development. It is not yet clear why there is a large range of features and severity among people with a 15q11.2 microdeletion, or why some people are unaffected.\", 'What are the signs and symptoms of Harrod Doman Keele syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Harrod Doman Keele syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal nasal morphology 90% Abnormality of the palate 90% Abnormality of the pinna 90% Abnormality of the teeth 90% Arachnodactyly 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Hypotelorism 90% Intrauterine growth retardation 90% Long face 90% Microcephaly 90% Narrow face 90% Narrow mouth 90% Pointed chin 90% Abnormality of pelvic girdle bone morphology 50% Abnormality of the shoulder 50% Cataract 50% Cerebral cortical atrophy 50% Cryptorchidism 50% Displacement of the external urethral meatus 50% Hypopigmented skin patches 50% Joint hypermobility 50% Kyphosis 50% Multicystic kidney dysplasia 50% Scoliosis 50% Seizures 50% Abnormal facial shape - Aganglionic megacolon - Dental malocclusion - External genital hypoplasia - Failure to thrive - High palate - Hypospadias - Intellectual disability - Long nose - Macrotia - Malrotation of small bowel - Pyloric stenosis - Renal cortical microcysts - Varicose veins - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Nocardiosis is a rare disorder that affects the brain, skin, and/or lungs. It occurs mainly in people with a weakened immune system. This condition usually starts in the lungs and can spread to other body organs. Affected individuals usually experience problems with their lungs (chest pain, coughing up blood, fevers), brain (headaches and seizures), and skin (skin infections, ulcers, and abscesses). The nocardia bacteria are found in soil around the world. People contract this disease by either inhaling contaminated dust or if soil containing nocardia bacteria get into an open wound. While anyone can contract this condition, people with a weakened immune system or chronic lung disease are at greatest risk of this condition.', 'Barrett esophagus is a condition in which the lining of the esophagus (the tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach) is replaced by tissue that is similar to the lining of the intestines. Although this change does not cause any specific signs or symptoms, it is typically diagnosed in people who have long-term gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The exact underlying cause of Barrett esophagus is not known; however, it generally occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. Treatment varies by the severity of the condition and generally includes medications and life style modifications to ease the symptoms of GERD. Endoscopic or surgical treatments may be recommended in people with severe cases.']}"}, "time": 1746283459.259692}
