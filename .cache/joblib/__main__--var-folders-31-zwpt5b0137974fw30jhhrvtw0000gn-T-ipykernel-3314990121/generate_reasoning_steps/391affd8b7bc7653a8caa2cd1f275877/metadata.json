The Federal government sets up general guidelines for the program, but each state has its own rules. Your state might require you to pay a part of the cost for some medical services.     You have to meet certain requirements to get Medicaid help. These might involve       - Your age    - Whether you are pregnant, disabled, or blind    - Your income and resources    - Whether or not you are a U.S. citizen or, if not, what your immigration status is       Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', \"Summary : Part D is the name of Medicare's prescription drug coverage. It's insurance that helps people pay for prescription drugs. It is available to everyone who has Medicare. It provides protection if you pay high drug costs or have unexpected prescription drug bills. It doesn't cover all costs. You have to pay part of the cost of prescription drugs. Most people also have to pay an additional monthly cost.    Private companies provide Medicare prescription drug coverage. You choose the drug plan you like best. Whether or not you should sign up depends on how good your current coverage is. You need to sign up as soon as you are eligible for Medicare. Otherwise, there may be additional charges.    Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\", 'Summary : A mastectomy is surgery to remove a breast or part of a breast. It is usually done to treat breast cancer. Types of breast surgery include       - Total (simple) mastectomy - removal of breast tissue and nipple    - Modified radical mastectomy - removal of the breast, most of the lymph nodes under the arm, and often the lining over the chest muscles    - Lumpectomy - surgery to remove the tumor and a small amount of normal tissue around it       Which surgery you have depends on the stage of cancer, size of the tumor, size of the breast, and whether the lymph nodes are involved. Many women have breast reconstruction to rebuild the breast after a mastectomy.    Sometimes mastectomy is done to prevent breast cancer. Only high-risk patients have this type of surgery.
