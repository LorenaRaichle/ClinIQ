Some common ones are:\\n                \\nSepsis. This is a condition in which bacteria infect the bloodstream.\\n                \\nPneumonia. This is an infection in the lungs.\\n                \\nSevere bleeding caused by an injury to the body.\\n                \\nAn injury to the chest or head, like a severe blow.\\n                \\nBreathing in harmful fumes or smoke.\\n                \\nInhaling vomited stomach contents from the mouth.\\n                \\nIt's not clear why some very sick or seriously injured people develop ARDS and others don't. Researchers are trying to find out why ARDS develops and how to prevent it.\", 'People at risk for ARDS have a condition or illness that can directly or indirectly injure their lungs.\\n                \\nDirect Lung Injury\\n                \\nConditions that can directly injure the lungs include:\\n                \\nPneumonia. This is an infection in the lungs.\\n                \\nBreathing in harmful fumes or smoke.\\n                \\nInhaling vomited stomach contents from the mouth.\\n                \\nUsing a ventilator. This is a machine that helps people breathe; rarely, it can injure the lungs.\\n                \\nNearly drowning.\\n                \\nIndirect Lung Injury\\n                \\nConditions that can indirectly injure the lungs include:\\n                \\nSepsis. This is a condition in which bacteria infect the bloodstream.\\n                \\nSevere bleeding caused by an injury to the body or having many blood transfusions.\\n                \\nAn injury to the chest or head, such as a severe blow.\\n                \\nPancreatitis (PAN-kre-a-TI-tis). This is a condition in which the pancreas becomes irritated or infected. The pancreas is a gland that releases enzymes and hormones.\\n                \\nFat embolism (EM-bo-lizm). This is a condition in which fat blocks an artery. A physical injury, like a broken bone, can lead to a fat embolism.\\n                \\nDrug reaction.', \"The first signs and symptoms of ARDS are feeling like you can't get enough air into your lungs, rapid breathing, and a low blood oxygen level.\\n                \\nOther signs and symptoms depend on the cause of ARDS. They may occur before ARDS develops. For example, if pneumonia is causing ARDS, you may have a cough and fever before you feel short of breath.\\n                \\nSometimes people who have ARDS develop signs and symptoms such as low blood pressure, confusion, and extreme tiredness. This may mean that the body's organs, such as the kidneys and heart, aren't getting enough oxygen-rich blood.\\n                \\nPeople who develop ARDS often are in the hospital for other serious health problems. Rarely, people who aren't hospitalized have health problems that lead to ARDS, such as severe pneumonia.\\n                \\nIf you have trouble breathing, call your doctor right away. If you have severe shortness of breath, call 911.\\n                \\nComplications From ARDS\\n                \\nIf you have ARDS, you can develop other medical problems while in the hospital. The most common problems are: \\n                \\nInfections. Being in the hospital and lying down for a long time can put you at risk for infections, such as pneumonia. Being on a ventilator also puts you at higher risk for infections.\\n                \\nA pneumothorax (collapsed lung). This is a condition in which air or gas collects in the space around the lungs. This can cause one or both lungs to collapse. The air pressure from a ventilator can cause this condition.\\n                \\nLung scarring. ARDS causes the lungs to become stiff (scarred). It also makes it hard for the lungs to expand and fill with air. Being on a ventilator also can cause lung scarring.\\n                \\nBlood clots. Lying down for long periods can cause blood clots to form in your body. A blood clot that forms in a vein deep in your body is called a deep vein thrombosis. This type of blood clot can break off, travel through the bloodstream to the lungs, and block blood flow. This condition is called pulmonary embolism.\", 'Your doctor will diagnose ARDS based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results.\\n                \\nMedical History\\n                \\nYour doctor will ask whether you have or have recently had conditions that could lead to ARDS. For a list of these conditions, go to \"Who Is at Risk for ARDS?\"\\n                \\nYour doctor also will ask whether you have heart problems, such as heart failure. Heart failure can cause fluid to build up in your lungs.\\n                \\nPhysical Exam\\n                \\nARDS may cause abnormal breathing sounds, such as crackling. Your doctor will listen to your lungs with a stethoscope to hear these sounds.\\n                \\nHe or she also will listen to your heart and look for signs of extra fluid in other parts of your body. Extra fluid may mean you have heart or kidney problems.\\n                \\nYour doctor will look for a bluish color on your skin and lips. A bluish color means your blood has a low level of oxygen. This is a possible sign of ARDS.\\n                \\nDiagnostic Tests\\n                \\nYou may have ARDS or another condition that causes similar symptoms. To find out, your doctor may recommend one or more of the following tests.\\n                \\nInitial Tests\\n                \\nThe first tests done are:\\n                \\nAn arterial blood gas test. This blood test measures the oxygen level in your blood using a sample of blood taken from an artery. A low blood oxygen level might be a sign of ARDS.\\n                \\nChest x ray. This test creates pictures of the structures in your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. A chest x ray can show whether you have extra fluid in your lungs.\\n                \\nBlood tests, such as a complete blood count, blood chemistries, and blood cultures. These tests help find the cause of ARDS, such as an infection.\\n                \\nA sputum culture. This test is used to study the spit you\\'ve coughed up from your lungs. A sputum culture can help find the cause of an infection.\\n                \\nOther Tests\\n                \\nOther tests used to diagnose ARDS include:\\n                \\nChest computed tomography (to-MOG-rah-fee) scan, or chest CT scan. This test uses a computer to create detailed pictures of your lungs. A chest CT scan may show lung problems, such as fluid in the lungs, signs of pneumonia, or a tumor.\\n                \\nHeart tests that look for signs of heart failure. Heart failure is a condition in which the heart can\\'t pump enough blood to meet the body\\'s needs. This condition can cause fluid to build up in your lungs.']}"}, "time": 1746283465.413713}
