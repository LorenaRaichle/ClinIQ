The average age of diagnosis is 56.  This tumor is often first noticed as a bump or yellowish spot in the skin.  Though microcystic adnexal carcinomas frequently grow into and disturb nearby tissues and is therefore considered an invasive cancer, this type of tumor rarely spreads to more distant parts of the body (metastasizes). The main treatment for microcystic adnexal carcinoma is Mohs micrographic surgery, which is thought to improve the chances that all of the tumor cells are removed during surgery.', 'What are the symptoms of microcystic adnexal carcinoma? Microcystic adnexal carcinoma appears as a smooth bump or patch that is slightly raised from the surrounding skin.  It may be flesh-colored or yellowish, and it increases in size over time.  A microcystic adnexal carcinoma may grow into nerves nearby, which can cause discomfort, numbness, tingling (paresthesia), burning, or itching.', \"Is radiation therapy a recommended treatment for microcystic adnexal carcinoma? Unfortunately, because microcystic adnexal carcinoma is a rare cancer, there is currently not enough information to determine if radiation therapy is an effective treatment for this disease.  There are no guidelines for the use of radiation therapy as treatment for microcystic adnexal carcinoma, and little is known about the dose of radiation that might be needed to be effective.  Two articles studying a total of 17 patients receiving radiation therapy for microcystic adnexal carcinoma have suggested that there may be a benefit of radiation therapy for decreasing the chances of the tumor regrowing (recurrence), and the authors suggest that this treatment could be considered if there is evidence that cancer cells remain after surgery, or in situations where additional surgery cannot be done.  However, another article raises concerns about the use of radiation therapy considering the small number of patients studied, the report of one patient's disease potentially worsening after radiation therapy, and the belief that exposure to radiation may be a risk factor for the initial development of this tumor.\", 'What are the signs and symptoms of Frontometaphyseal dysplasia? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Frontometaphyseal dysplasia. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of dental morphology 90% Abnormality of frontal sinus 90% Abnormality of the metaphyses 90% Bowing of the long bones 90% Camptodactyly of finger 90% Craniofacial hyperostosis 90% Hypertelorism 90% Limitation of joint mobility 90% Prominent supraorbital ridges 90% Abnormal form of the vertebral bodies 50% Abnormality of the palate 50% Accelerated skeletal maturation 50% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the thumb 50% Arachnodactyly 50% Conductive hearing impairment 50% Elbow dislocation 50% Scoliosis 50% Sensorineural hearing impairment 50% Skeletal muscle atrophy 50% Synostosis of carpal bones 50% Ulnar deviation of finger 50% Abnormality of the larynx 7.5% Abnormality of the urethra 7.5% Complete atrioventricular canal defect 7.5% Craniosynostosis 7.5% Tracheal stenosis 7.5% Ureteral stenosis 7.5% Ankle contracture - Antegonial notching of mandible - Anteriorly placed odontoid process - Broad phalanges of the hand - Coarse facial features - Coat hanger sign of ribs - Cor pulmonale - Coxa valga - Delayed eruption of teeth - Dental malocclusion - Elbow flexion contracture - Fused cervical vertebrae - Genu valgum - High palate - Hirsutism - Hydronephrosis - Hydroureter - Increased density of long bone diaphyses - Intellectual disability - Knee flexion contracture - Large foramen magnum - Long foot - Long phalanx of finger - Mitral valve prolapse - Partial fusion of carpals - Partial fusion of tarsals - Persistence of primary teeth - Pointed chin - Scapular winging - Selective tooth agenesis - Short chin - Stridor - Wide nasal bridge - Wrist flexion contracture - X-linked recessive inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.']}"}, "time": 1746283459.5752058}
