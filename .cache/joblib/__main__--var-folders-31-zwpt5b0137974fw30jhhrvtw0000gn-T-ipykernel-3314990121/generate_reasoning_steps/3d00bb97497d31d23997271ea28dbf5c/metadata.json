Is growth hormone therapy an option? Is surgery helpful? Can the vision problems be corrected? There is no specific treatment for axial spondylometaphyseal dysplasia. Symptoms such as lung infections, breathing difficulties, coxa vara, scoliosis, retinitis pigmentosa, and optic atrophy are managed individually. Specialists such as opthmologists, geneticists, and orthopedists work in concert in devloping an individualized treatment plan. We are unaware of any cases describing the use of growth hormone therapies for treatment of short stature caused by axial spondylometaphyseal dysplasia. Treatment of skeletal dysplasias with growth hormone therapy must be done with caution.  The Little People of America, Inc Web site lists articles on repiratory and breathing problems in people with skeletal dysplasias, including an article titled Breathing Problems Among Little People: When to Be Concerned. Detailed information related to the management of retinitis pigmentosa can be accessed through GeneReviews and the Treatment and Medication sections of Medscape Reference. Detailed information related to the management of coxa vara can also be found in the Treatment sections of a Medscape Reference review article on this condition. Johns Hopkins Department of Orthopedic Surgery offers a Patient Guide to Scoliosis. MedlinePlus.gov provides information on optic atrophy.  Further medical support resources can be found through the Little People of America, Inc.', 'Hypoplastic right heart syndrome is a rare heart defect, present at birth (congenital), that results in low blood oxygen levels. It is caused by underdevelopment of the structures on the right side of the heart (tricuspid valve, right ventricle, pulmonary valve, and pulmonary artery) and commonly associated with atrial septal defect. The underdeveloped right side of the heart is unable to provide enough blood flow to the body, leading to low blood oxygen and cyanosis. It differs from hypoplastic left heart syndrome which involves the underdevelopment of the structures on the left side of the heart.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Poikiloderma with neutropenia? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Poikiloderma with neutropenia. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Hypertelorism 5% Hypoplasia of midface 5% Malar flattening 5% Autosomal recessive inheritance - Blepharitis - Conjunctivitis - Neutropenia - Poikiloderma - Recurrent otitis media - Recurrent pneumonia - Short stature - Splenomegaly - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', \"Cushing's syndrome is an endocrine disorder caused by prolonged exposure of the body's tissues to high levels of cortisol (a hormone produced by the adrenal gland). It most commonly affects adults between age 20 and 50 years. Signs and symptoms of Cushing's syndrome include upper body obesity, fatigue, muscle weakness, high blood pressure, backache, high blood sugar, easy bruising and bluish-red stretch marks on the skin. Affected women may also experience irregular menstrual periods and increased growth of body and facial hair. This condition may be caused by a variety of factors including long-term use of corticosteroid medications, tumors in the pituitary gland or adrenal adenomas.Treatment depends on the underlying cause, but may include decreasing the dosage of corticosteroids or surgery to remove tumors.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283455.195495}
