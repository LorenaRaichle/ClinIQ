Surfactant is a liquid that coats the inside of the lungs. It helps keep the lungs open so your infant can breathe in air once he or she is born.\\n                \\nCorticosteroids also can help your baby's lungs, brain, and kidneys develop more quickly while he or she is in the womb.\\n                \\nPremature babies who have very low birth weights also might be given corticosteroids within the first few days of birth. Doctors sometimes prescribe inhaled nitric oxide shortly after birth for babies who have very low birth weights. This treatment can help improve the babies' lung function.\\n                \\nThese preventive measures may help reduce infants' risk of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), which can lead to BPD.\\n                \\nTreatment for Respiratory Distress Syndrome\\n                \\nThe goals of treating infants who have RDS include:\\n                \\nReducing further injury to the lungs\\n                \\nProviding nutrition and other support to help the lungs grow and recover\\n                \\nPreventing lung infections by giving antibiotics\\n                \\nTreatment of RDS usually begins as soon as an infant is born, sometimes in the delivery room. Most infants who have signs of RDS are quickly moved to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). They receive around-the-clock treatment from health care professionals who specialize in treating premature infants.\\n                \\nTreatments for RDS include surfactant replacement therapy, breathing support with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) or a ventilator, oxygen therapy (oxygen given through nasal prongs, a mask, or a breathing tube), and medicines to treat fluid buildup in the lungs.\\n                \\nFor more information about RDS treatments, go to the Health Topics Respiratory Distress Syndrome article.\\n                \\nTreatment for Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia\\n                \\nTreatment in the NICU is designed to limit stress on infants and meet their basic needs of warmth, nutrition, and protection. Once doctors diagnose BPD, some or all of the treatments used for RDS will continue in the NICU.\\n                \\nSuch treatment usually includes:\\n                \\nUsing radiant warmers or incubators to keep infants warm and reduce the risk of infection.\\n                \\nOngoing monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, breathing, and temperature through sensors taped to the babies' bodies.\\n                \\nUsing sensors on fingers or toes to check the amount of oxygen in the infants' blood.\\n                \\nGiving fluids and nutrients through needles or tubes inserted into the infants' veins. This helps prevent malnutrition and promotes growth. Nutrition is vital to the growth and development of the lungs. Later, babies may be given breast milk or infant formula through feeding tubes that are passed through their noses or mouths and into their throats.\\n                \\nChecking fluid intake to make sure that fluid doesn't build up in the babies' lungs.\\n                \\nAs BPD improves, babies are slowly weaned off NCPAP or ventilators until they can breathe on their own. These infants will likely need oxygen therapy for some time.\\n                \\nIf your infant has moderate or severe BPD, echocardiography might be done every few weeks to months to check his or her pulmonary artery pressure.\\n                \\nIf your child needs long-term ventilator support, he or she will likely get a tracheostomy (TRA-ke-OS-toe-me). A tracheostomy is a surgically made hole. It goes through the front of the neck and into the trachea (TRA-ke-ah), or windpipe. Your child's doctor will put the breathing tube from the ventilator through the hole.\\n                \\nUsing a tracheostomy instead of an endotracheal (en-do-TRA-ke-al) tube has some advantages. (An endotracheal tube is a breathing tube inserted through the nose or mouth and into the windpipe.)\\n                \\nLong-term use of an endotracheal tube can damage the trachea. This damage may need to be corrected with surgery later. A tracheostomy can allow your baby to interact more with you and the NICU staff, start talking, and develop other skills.\\n                \\nWhile your baby is in the NICU, he or she also may need physical therapy. Physical therapy can help strengthen your child's muscles and clear mucus out of his or her lungs.\\n                \\nInfants who have BPD may spend several weeks or months in the hospital. This allows them to get the care they need.\\n                \\nBefore your baby goes home, learn as much as you can about your child's condition and how it's treated. Your baby may continue to have some breathing symptoms after he or she leaves the hospital.\\n                \\nYour child will likely continue on all or some of the treatments that were started at the hospital, including:\\n                \\nMedicines, such as bronchodilators, steroids, and diuretics.\\n                \\nOxygen therapy or breathing support from NCPAP or a ventilator.\\n                \\nExtra nutrition and calories, which may be given through a feeding tube.\\n                \\nPreventive treatment with a medicine called palivizumab for severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). This common virus leads to mild, cold-like symptoms in adults and older, healthy children. However, in infantsespecially those in high-risk groupsRSV can lead to severe breathing problems.\\n                \\nYour child also should have regular checkups with and timely vaccinations from a pediatrician. This is a doctor who specializes in treating children. If your child needs oxygen therapy or a ventilator at home, a pulmonary specialist might be involved in his or her care.\\n                \\nSeek out support from family, friends, and hospital staff. Ask the case manager or social worker at the hospital about what you'll need after your baby leaves the hospital.\\n                \\nThe doctors and nurses can assist with questions about your infant's care. Also, you may want to ask whether your community has a support group for parents of premature infants.\", \"Taking steps to ensure a healthy pregnancy might prevent your infant from being born before his or her lungs have fully developed. These steps include:\\n                \\nSeeing your doctor regularly during your pregnancy\\n                \\nFollowing a healthy diet\\n                \\nNot smoking and avoiding tobacco smoke, alcohol, and illegal drugs\\n                \\nControlling any ongoing medical conditions you have\\n                \\nPreventing infection\\n                \\nIf your doctor thinks that you're going to give birth too early, he or she may give you injections of a corticosteroid medicine.\\n                \\nThe medicine can speed up surfactant production in your baby. Surfactant is a liquid that coats the inside of the lungs. It helps keep them open so your infant can breathe in air once he or she is born.\\n                \\nUsually, within about 24 hours of your taking this medicine, the baby's lungs start making enough surfactant. This will reduce the infant's risk of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), which can lead to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).\\n                \\nCorticosteroids also can help your baby's lungs, brain, and kidneys develop more quickly while he or she is in the womb.\\n                \\nIf your baby does develop RDS, it will probably be fairly mild. If the RDS isn't mild, BPD will likely develop.\", \"Carotid artery disease is a disease in which a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside the carotid arteries. You have two common carotid arteries, one on each side of your neck. They each divide into internal and external carotid arteries.\\n                \\nThe internal carotid arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your brain. The external carotid arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your face, scalp, and neck.\\n                \\nCarotid Arteries\\n                \\n\\n                \\nCarotid artery disease is serious because it can cause a stroke, also called a brain attack. A stroke occurs if blood flow to your brain is cut off.\\n                \\nIf blood flow is cut off for more than a few minutes, the cells in your brain start to die. This impairs the parts of the body that the brain cells control. A stroke can cause lasting brain damage; long-term disability, such as vision or speech problems or paralysis (an inability to move); or death.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nCarotid artery disease is a major cause of stroke in the United States. Over time, plaque hardens and narrows the arteries. This may limit the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your organs and other parts of your body.\\n                \\nAtherosclerosis can affect any artery in the body. For example, if plaque builds up in the coronary (heart) arteries, a heart attack can occur. If plaque builds up in the carotid arteries, a stroke can occur.\\n                \\nA stroke also can occur if blood clots form in the carotid arteries. This can happen if the plaque in an artery cracks or ruptures. Blood cell fragments called platelets (PLATE-lets) stick to the site of the injury and may clump together to form blood clots. Blood clots can partly or fully block a carotid artery.\\n                \\nA piece of plaque or a blood clot also can break away from the wall of the carotid artery. The plaque or clot can travel through the bloodstream and get stuck in one of the brain's smaller arteries. This can block blood flow in the artery and cause a stroke.\\n                \\nCarotid artery disease may not cause signs or symptoms until the carotid arteries are severely narrowed or blocked. For some people, a stroke is the first sign of the disease.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nCarotid artery disease is a major cause of stroke in the United States. Other conditions, such as certain heart problems and bleeding in the brain, also can cause strokes.Lifestyle changes, medicines, and medical procedures can help prevent or treat carotid artery disease and may reduce the risk of stroke.\\n                \\nIf you think you're having a stroke, you need urgent treatment. Call 911 right away if you have symptoms of a stroke. Do not drive yourself to the hospital.You have the best chance for full recovery if treatment to open a blocked artery is given within 4 hours of symptom onset. The sooner treatment occurs, the better your chances of recovery.\", 'Carotid artery disease seems to start when damage occurs to the inner layers of the carotid arteries. Major factors that contribute to damage include:\\n                \\nSmoking\\n                \\nHigh levels of certain fats and cholesterol in the blood\\n                \\nHigh blood pressure\\n                \\nHigh levels of sugar in the blood due to insulin resistance or diabetes\\n                \\nWhen damage occurs, your body starts a healing process. The healing may cause plaque to build up where the arteries are damaged.\\n                \\nThe plaque in an artery can crack or rupture. If this happens, blood cell fragments called platelets will stick to the site of the injury and may clump together to form blood clots. \\n                \\nThe buildup of plaque or blood clots can severely narrow or block the carotid arteries. This limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your brain, which can cause a stroke.']}"}, "time": 1746283466.5766559}
