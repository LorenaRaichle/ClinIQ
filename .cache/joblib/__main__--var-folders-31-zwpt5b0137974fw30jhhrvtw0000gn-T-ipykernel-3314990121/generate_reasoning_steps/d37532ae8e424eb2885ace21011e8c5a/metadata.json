The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for X-linked thrombocytopenia. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the musculature - Bruising susceptibility - Congenital thrombocytopenia - Decreased mean platelet volume - Eczema - Epistaxis - Increased IgA level - Increased IgE level - Intermittent thrombocytopenia - Joint hemorrhage - Petechiae - X-linked recessive inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Neonatal hemochromatosis is a disease in which too much iron builds up in the body. In this form of hemochromatosis the iron overload begins before birth. This disease tends to progress rapidly and is characterized by liver damage that is apparent at birth or in the first day of life. There are a number of other forms of hemochromatosis. To learn more about these other forms click on the disease names listed below: Hemochromatosis type 1 Hemochromatosis type 2 Hemochromatosis type 3 Hemochromatosis type 4', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Neonatal hemochromatosis?

Signs and symptoms include congenital nephrotic syndrome and distinct ocular (eye) abnormalities, including microcoria (small pupils that are not responsive to light). Most affected children have early-onset, chronic renal failure; neurodevelopmental problems; and blindness. Hypotonia (poor muscle tone) and movement disorders have also been reported. Pierson syndrome is caused by changes (mutations) in the LAMB2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The long-term outlook is poor; affected infants may not survive past the first weeks or months of life.']}"}, "time": 1746283460.6389508}
