A diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), dermatosparaxis type is typically based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms. Genetic testing for a change (mutation) in the ADAMTS2 gene and/or a skin biopsy can then be ordered to confirm the diagnosis.', 'How might Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, dermatosparaxis type be treated? The treatment of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), dermatosparaxis type is focused on preventing serious complications and relieving associated signs and symptoms. For example, physical therapy may be recommended in children with moderate to severe joint hypermobility. Assistive devices such as braces, wheelchairs, or scooters may also be necessary depending on the severity of joint instability. Hernias may be treated with surgery. Because EDS, dermatosparaxis type is associated with extremely fragile skin, affected people, especially children, may need to use protective bandages or pads over exposed areas, such as the knees, shins, and forehead. Heavy exercise and contact sports may also need to be avoided due to skin fragility and easy bruising. Please speak to your healthcare provider if you have any questions about your personal medical management plan.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Striatonigral degeneration infantile? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Striatonigral degeneration infantile. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal recessive inheritance - Choreoathetosis - Developmental regression - Developmental stagnation - Dysphagia - Dystonia - Failure to thrive - Intellectual disability - Optic atrophy - Pendular nystagmus - Spasticity - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Budd-Chiari syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by narrowing and obstruction of the veins of the liver. This narrowing or obstruction slows or prevents blood from flowing out of the liver and back to the heart which can lead to liver damage. While some people experience no symptoms, many experience fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea, and jaundice. Other associated findings include an accumulation of fluid in the abdomen (ascites), an enlarged spleen and/or liver, and severe bleeding in the esophagus. The severity of the disorder varies from case to case, depending on the site and number of affected veins. Drugs may be used to dissolve or decrease the size of the obstruction (if it is a clot). In some cases surgery is performed. In most cases, the cause of Budd-Chiari syndrome is unknown.']}"}, "time": 1746283459.47051}
