They may occur 30times or more an hour. Typically, normal breathing then starts again, sometimes with a loud snort or choking sound.\\n                \\nSleep apnea usually is a chronic (ongoing) condition that disrupts your sleep. When your breathing pauses or becomes shallow, youll often move out of deep sleep and into light sleep.\\n                \\nAs a result, the quality of your sleep is poor, which makes you tired during the day. Sleep apnea is a leading cause of excessive daytime sleepiness.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nSleep apnea often goes undiagnosed. Doctors usually can\\'t detect the condition during routine office visits. Also, no blood test can help diagnose the condition.\\n                \\nMost people who have sleep apnea don\\'t know they have it because it only occurs during sleep. A family member or bed partner might be the first to notice signs of sleep apnea.\\n                \\nThe most common type of sleep apnea is obstructive sleep apnea. In this condition, the airway collapses or becomes blocked during sleep. This causes shallow breathing or breathing pauses.\\n                \\nWhen you try to breathe, any air that squeezes past the blockage can cause loud snoring. Obstructive sleep apnea is more common in people who are overweight, but it can affect anyone. For example, small children who have enlarged tonsil tissues in their throats may have obstructive sleep apnea.\\n                \\nThe animation below shows how obstructive sleep apnea occurs.

This disorder occurs if the area of your brain that controls your breathing doesn\\'t send the correct signals to your breathing muscles. As a result, you\\'ll make no effort to breathe for brief periods.\\n                \\nCentral sleep apnea can affect anyone. However, it\\'s more common in people who have certain medical conditions or use certain medicines.\\n                \\nCentral sleep apnea can occur with obstructive sleep apnea or alone. Snoring typically doesn\\'t happen with central sleep apnea.\\n                \\nThis article mainly focuses on obstructive sleep apnea.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nUntreated sleep apnea can:\\n                \\nIncrease the risk of high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, obesity, and diabetes\\n                \\nIncrease the risk of, or worsen, heart failure\\n                \\nMake arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs), or irregular heartbeats, more likely\\n                \\nIncrease the chance of having work-related or driving accidents\\n                \\nSleep apnea is a chronic condition that requires long-term management. Lifestyle changes, mouthpieces, surgery, and breathing devices can successfully treat sleep apnea in many people.', \"When you're awake, throat muscles help keep your airway stiff and open so air can flow into your lungs. When you sleep, these muscles relax, which narrows your throat.\\n                \\nNormally, this narrowing doesnt prevent air from flowing into and out of your lungs. But if you have sleep apnea, your airway can become partially or fully blocked because:\\n                \\nYour throat muscles and tongue relax more than normal.\\n                \\nYour tongue and tonsils (tissue masses in the back of your mouth) are large compared with the opening into your windpipe.\\n                \\nYou're overweight. The extra soft fat tissue can thicken the wall of the windpipe. This narrows the inside of the windpipe, which makes it harder to keep open.\\n                \\nThe shape of your head and neck (bony structure) may cause a smaller airway size in the mouth and throat area.\\n                \\nThe aging process limits your brain signals' ability to keep your throat muscles stiff during sleep. Thus, your airway is more likely to narrow or collapse.\\n                \\nNot enough air flows into your lungs if your airway is partially or fully blocked during sleep. As a result, loud snoring and a drop in your blood oxygen level can occur.\\n                \\nIf the oxygen drops to a dangerous level, it triggers your brain to disturb your sleep. This helps tighten the upper airway muscles and open your windpipe. Normal breathing then starts again, often with a loud snort or choking sound.\\n                \\nFrequent drops in your blood oxygen level and reduced sleep quality can trigger the release of stress hormones. These hormones raise your heart rate and increase your risk for high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, and arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats). The hormones also can raise your risk for, or worsen, heart failure.\\n                \\nUntreated sleep apnea also can lead to changes in how your body uses energy. These changes increase your risk for obesity and diabetes.\", 'Obstructive sleep apnea is a common condition. About half of the people who have this condition are overweight.\\n                \\nMen are more likely than women to have sleep apnea. Although the condition can occur at any age, the risk increases as you get older. A family history of sleep apnea also increases your risk for the condition.\\n                \\nPeople who have small airways in their noses, throats, or mouths are more likely to have sleep apnea. Small airways might be due to the shape of these structures or allergies or other conditions that cause congestion.\\n                \\nSmall children might have enlarged tonsil tissues in their throats. Enlarged tonsil tissues raise a childs risk for sleep apnea. Overweight children also might be at increased risk for sleep apnea.\\n                \\nAbout half of the people who have sleep apnea also have high blood pressure. Sleep apnea also is linked to smoking, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and risk factors for stroke and heart failure.\\n                \\nRace and ethnicity might play a role in the risk of developing sleep apnea. However, more research is needed.', \"Major Signs and Symptoms\\n                \\nOne of the most common signs of obstructive sleep apnea is loud and chronic (ongoing) snoring. Pauses may occur in the snoring. Choking or gasping may follow the pauses.\\n                \\nThe snoring usually is loudest when you sleep on your back; it might be less noisy when you turn on your side. You might not snore every night. Over time, however, the snoring can happen more often and get louder.\\n                \\nYou're asleep when the snoring or gasping happens. You likely won't know that you're having problems breathing or be able to judge how severe the problem is. A family member or bed partner often will notice these problems before you do.\\n                \\nNot everyone who snores has sleep apnea.\\n                \\nAnother common sign of sleep apnea is fighting sleepiness during the day, at work, or while driving. You may find yourself rapidly falling asleep during the quiet moments of the day when you're not active. Even if you don't have daytime sleepiness, talk with your doctor if you have problems breathing during sleep.\\n                \\nOther Signs and Symptoms\\n                \\nOthers signs and symptoms of sleep apnea include:\\n                \\nMorning headaches\\n                \\nMemory or learning problems and not being able to concentrate\\n                \\nFeeling irritable, depressed, or having mood swings or personality changes\\n                \\nWaking up frequently to urinate\\n                \\nDry mouth or sore throat when you wake up\\n                \\nIn children, sleep apnea can cause hyperactivity, poor school performance, and angry or hostile behavior. Children who have sleep apnea also may breathe through their mouths instead of their noses during the day.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283466.312299}
