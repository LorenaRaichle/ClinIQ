ADNP syndrome can affect muscle tone, feeding, growth, hearing, vision, sleep, fine and gross motor skills, as well as the immune system, heart, endocrine system, and gastrointestinal tract.[1] ADNP syndrome causes behavior disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). ADNP is caused by a non-inherited (de novo) ADNP gene mutation. ADNP syndrome is thought to be one of the most common causes of non-inherited genetic autism.[1]', 'What are the signs and symptoms of ADNP syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for ADNP syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of cardiovascular system morphology 5% Seizures 5% Autistic behavior - Cleft eyelid - Feeding difficulties - Hyperactivity - Hypermetropia - Intellectual disability - Joint laxity - Language impairment - Muscular hypotonia - Obesity - Obsessive-compulsive behavior - Prominent forehead - Ptosis - Recurrent infections - Short nose - Short stature - Small hand - Smooth philtrum - Stereotypic behavior - Strabismus - Visual impairment - Wide nasal bridge - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy (AVMD) is an eye disorder that can cause progressive vision loss. AVMD affects an area of the retina called the macula, which is responsible for sharp central vision. The condition causes a fatty yellow pigment to accumulate in cells underlying the macula, eventually damaging the cells. Signs and symptoms usually begin between ages 30 and 50 and include blurred and/or distorted vision, which can progress to central vision loss over time.Historically, AVMD has been characterized as a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the PRPH2, BEST1, IMPG1, and IMPG2 genes; however, recent studies focused on genetic testing suggest that there may be other unidentified genes and/or environmental causes.The majority of cases due to a mutation in the identified genes are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner; however not all individuals have AVMD have a family history and not all individuals who inherit a causative gene mutation develop symptoms.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy? Signs and symptoms of adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy typically begin during mid-adulthood, in the fourth or fifth decade of life. At the time of diagnosis, individuals may have minimal visual symptoms (such as mild blurring) or mild metamorphopsia (distorted vision). Cells underlying the macula become more damaged over time, which can cause slowly progressive vision loss. The condition is usually bilateral (affecting both eyes). It usually does not affect peripheral vision or the ability to see at night. Studies have revealed much variability in the signs, symptoms and progression of this condition. It has been reported that while one individual may not have significant changes in visual acuity over several years, another may experience ongoing visual loss. It has been suggested that in the majority of affected individuals, progression of functional loss is limited. In general, the long-term outlook (prognosis) is usually good, but loss of central visual function is possible.
