It starts with       - Fever    - Headache    - Muscle aches    - Tiredness    - Loss of appetite       After that, the salivary glands under the ears or jaw become swollen and tender. The swelling can be on one or both sides of the face. Symptoms last 7 to 10 days. Serious complications are rare.    You can catch mumps by being with another person who has it. There is no treatment for mumps, but the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine can prevent it.    Before the routine vaccination program in the United States, mumps was a common illness in infants, children and young adults. Now it is a rare disease in the U.S.    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', \"Chiari malformations (CMs) are structural defects in the cerebellum. The cerebellum is the part of the brain that controls balance. With CM, brain tissue extends into the spinal canal. It can happen when part of the skull is too small, which pushes the brain tissue down. There are several types of CM. One type often happens in children who have neural tube defects. Some types cause no symptoms and don't need treatment. If you have symptoms, they may include       - Neck pain    - Balance problems    - Numbness or other abnormal feelings in the arms or legs    - Dizziness    - Vision problems    - Difficulty swallowing    - Poor hand coordination       Doctors diagnose CM using imaging tests. Medicines may ease some symptoms, such as pain. Surgery is the only treatment available to correct or stop the progression of nerve damage.    NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke\", 'Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) occurs when one of your heart\\'s valves doesn\\'t work properly. The flaps of the valve are \"floppy\" and don\\'t close tightly. Most people who have the condition are born with it. It also tends to run in families.    Most of the time, MVP doesn\\'t cause any problems. Rarely, blood can leak the wrong way through the floppy valve. This can cause       - Palpitations (feelings that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, or beating too hard or too fast)    - Shortness of breath    - Cough    - Fatigue, dizziness, or anxiety    - Migraine headaches    - Chest discomfort       Most people who have mitral valve prolapse (MVP) don\\'t need treatment because they don\\'t have symptoms and complications. If you need treatment for MVP, medicines can help relieve symptoms or prevent complications. Very few people will need surgery to repair or replace the mitral valve.    MVP puts you at risk for infective endocarditis, a kind of heart infection. To prevent it, doctors used to prescribe antibiotics before dental work or certain surgeries. Now, only people at high risk of endocarditis need the antibiotics.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', \"Menopause is the time in a woman's life when her period stops. It usually occurs naturally, most often after age 45. Menopause happens because the woman's ovaries stop producing the hormones estrogen and progesterone.     A woman has reached menopause when she has not had a period for one year. Changes and symptoms can start several years earlier. They include       - A change in periods - shorter or longer, lighter or heavier, with more or less time in between     - Hot flashes and/or night sweats     - Trouble sleeping     - Vaginal dryness     - Mood swings    - Trouble focusing    - Less hair on head, more on face        Some symptoms require treatment. Talk to your doctor about how to best manage menopause. Make sure the doctor knows your medical history and your family medical history. This includes whether you are at risk for heart disease, osteoporosis, or breast cancer.    Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health\"]}"}, "time": 1746283466.783356}
