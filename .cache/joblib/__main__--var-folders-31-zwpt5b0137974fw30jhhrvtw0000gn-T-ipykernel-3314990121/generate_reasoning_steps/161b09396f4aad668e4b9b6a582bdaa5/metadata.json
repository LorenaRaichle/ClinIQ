The Lupus Foundation of American has a page called Is lupus hereditary? that provides a good overview. They also have a Genetics page for all of their content tagged as related to genetics. Medscape Reference has an in-depth review of the genetics of lupus that was written for healthcare professionals but can be useful to anyone looking for detailed information. You may have to register to view the article, but registration is free.', 'How might lupus be treated? For information on the treatment of lupus, you can read the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) publication called Handout on Health: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. NIAMS is the primary NIH organization for research and information on lupus.', 'Ovarian small cell carcinoma is a rare cancer that typically occurs in young women. It is an aggressive tumor that can metastasize to other parts of the body. Ovarian small cell carcinoma is associated with hypercalcemia and is usually treated with platinum or etoposide-based chemotherapy.', 'What treatments are available for ovarian small cell carcinoma? Ovarian small cell carcinoma is often treated with surgery and chemotherapy. Radiation therapy may also be used in some cases. Because this tumor is derived from the primitive germ cells (eggs) of the ovary, it is often treated with a chemotherapy regimen similar to what is used to treat ovarian germ cell tumors. Specifically, platinum and etoposide based chemotherapy is typically used to treat ovarian small cell carcinoma.']}"}, "time": 1746283455.4134028}
