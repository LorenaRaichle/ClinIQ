Traditionally, surgery has been the main treatment for craniopharyngioma. However, radiation treatment instead of surgery may be the best choice for some patients. In tumors that cannot be removed completely with surgery alone, radiation therapy is usually necessary. If the tumor has a classic appearance on CT scan, then even a biopsy may not be necessary, if treatment with radiation alone is planned. This tumor is best treated at a center with experience managing craniopharyngiomas.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease with ptosis and parkinsonism? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease with ptosis and parkinsonism. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal atrioventricular conduction - Atrioventricular block - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Axonal loss - Central hypoventilation - Chronic diarrhea - Chronic sensorineural polyneuropathy - Decreased nerve conduction velocity - Degeneration of anterior horn cells - Dementia - Distal amyotrophy - Enhanced neurotoxicity of vincristine - Gliosis - Hyperhidrosis - Hyperreflexia - Nausea - Orthostatic hypotension - Parkinsonism - Penetrating foot ulcers - Peroneal muscle atrophy - Peroneal muscle weakness - Pes cavus - Ptosis - Sensory neuropathy - Trophic limb changes - Vomiting - X-linked inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'The Rh deficiency syndrome, also known as Rh-null syndrome, is a blood disorder where people have red blood cells (RBCs) lacking all Rh antigens. The Rh antigens maintain the integrity of the RBC membrane and therefore, RBCs which lack Rh antigens have an abnormal shape. There are two types of Rh deficiency syndrome: The regulator type is associated with many different changes (mutations) in the RHAG gene .  The amorph type is caused by inactive copies of a gene (silent alleles) at the RH locus. As a result, the RBCs do not express any of the Rh antigens. The absence of the Rh complex alters the RBC shape, increases its tendency to break down (osmotic fragility), and shortens its lifespan, resulting in a hemolytic anemia that is usually mild. These patients are at risk of having adverse transfusion reactions because they may produce antibodies against several of the Rh antigens and can only receive blood from people who have the same condition. Rh deficiency syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Management is individualized according to the severity of hemolytic anemia.', 'Cheilitis glandularis is a rare inflammatory disorder of the lip. It is mainly characterized by swelling of the lip with hyperplasia of the salivary glands; secretion of a clear, thick mucus; and variable inflammation. Enlargement and chronic exposure of the mucous membrane on the lower lip becomes affected by the environment, leading to erosion, ulceration, crusting, and, occasionally, infection. Cheilitis glandularis is more common in adult males, although cases have been described in women and children. In Caucasians, it is associated with a relatively high incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the lip. Although there may be a genetic susceptibility, no definitive cause has been established. Treatment may include surgical excision by vermilionectomy (sometimes called a lip shave), but treatment varies for each individual.']}"}, "time": 1746283455.614293}
