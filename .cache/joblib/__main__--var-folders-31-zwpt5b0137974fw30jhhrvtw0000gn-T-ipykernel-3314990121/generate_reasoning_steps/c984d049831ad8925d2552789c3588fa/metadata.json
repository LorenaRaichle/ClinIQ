Largely, the cause of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is unknown. ICP is present in approximately 1% of pregnancies in the United States. It is thought to be caused by a mixture of genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors. Risk factors include: A personal or family history of cholestasis of pregnancy A history of liver disease A multiple gestation pregnancy (twins, triplets, etc) Approximately 15% of women with ICP have a mutation in either the ABCB11 orABCB4 gene. Mutations within these genes increase the likelihood that a woman will develop ICP. Mutations within the ABCB11 and ABCB4 gene(s) are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that in order to be affected, a person only needs a change in one copy of the responsible gene in each cell. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from an affected parent. Other cases may result from new (de novo) mutations within the gene. A person with a mutation in either theABCB11 or ABCB4 gene has a 50% chance with each pregnancy of passing along the altered gene to his or her child.', 'How is intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy diagnosed? Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is suspected during pregnancy when symptoms of itching (pruritis) present after 25 weeks of gestation with absence of a rash or underlying maternal liver disease. The diagnosis is typically confirmed with the finding of elevated serum bile acids. Is genetic testing available for intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy? In the presence of a family history of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) and/or known mutations in either the ABCB11 or ABCB4 genes, genetic testing is available. The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR), a resource from the National Center for Biotechnology, offers a listing of laboratories that perform genetic testing for intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. For more information, click on the link.', \"How might intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy be treated?  Treatment for intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy aims to relieve itching and prevent complications. Medications utilized to relieve itching might include ursodiol (Actigall, Urso), which helps decrease the level of bile in the mother's bloodstream, relieves itchiness and may reduce complications for the baby. To prevent pregnancy complications, close monitoring of the baby might be recommended. Even if prenatal tests appear normal, induction of early labor might be recommended.\", 'What are the signs and symptoms of Myelocerebellar disorder? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Myelocerebellar disorder. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the cerebellum 90% Gait disturbance 90% Incoordination 90% Abnormality of macrophages 50% Abnormality of neutrophils 50% Acute leukemia 50% Anemia 50% Hyperreflexia 50% Neurological speech impairment 50% Nystagmus 50% Recurrent respiratory infections 50% Splenomegaly 50% Abnormality of thrombocytes 7.5% Decreased antibody level in blood 7.5% Microcephaly 7.5% Acute myelomonocytic leukemia - Ataxia - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Cerebellar atrophy - Decreased nerve conduction velocity - Dysmetria - Hyperactive deep tendon reflexes - Hypoplastic anemia - Impaired vibration sensation in the lower limbs - Pancytopenia - Unsteady gait - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.']}"}, "time": 1746283455.312191}
