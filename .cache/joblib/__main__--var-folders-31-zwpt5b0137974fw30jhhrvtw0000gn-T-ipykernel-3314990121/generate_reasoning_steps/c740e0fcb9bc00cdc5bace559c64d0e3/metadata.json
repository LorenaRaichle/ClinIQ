Other types of doctors also may be involved, such as a cardiologist, pediatric cardiologist, and an infectious disease specialist.\\n                \\nA cardiologist treats adults who have heart problems. A pediatric cardiologist treats children who have heart problems. An infectious disease specialist treats people who have infections.\\n                \\nMedical History\\n                \\nYour doctor may ask whether you:\\n                \\nHave had a recent respiratory infection or flu-like illness\\n                \\nHave had a recent heart attack or injury to your chest\\n                \\nHave any other medical conditions\\n                \\nYour doctor also may ask about your symptoms. If you have chest pain, he or she will ask you to describe how it feels, where it's located, and whether it's worse when you lie down, breathe, or cough.\\n                \\nPhysical Exam\\n                \\nWhen the pericardium (the sac around your heart) is inflamed, the amount of fluid between its two layers of tissue increases. As part of the exam, your doctor will look for signs of excess fluid in your chest.\\n                \\nA common sign is the pericardial rub. This is the sound of the pericardium rubbing against the outer layer of your heart. Your doctor will place a stethoscope on your chest to listen for this sound.\\n                \\nYour doctor may hear other chest sounds that are signs of fluid in the pericardium (pericardial effusion) or the lungs (pleural effusion). These are more severe problems related to pericarditis.\\n                \\nDiagnostic Tests\\n                \\nYour doctor may recommend one or more tests to diagnose your condition and show how severe it is. The most common tests are:\\n                \\nEKG (electrocardiogram). This simple test detects and records your heart's electrical activity. Certain EKG results suggest pericarditis.\\n                \\nChest x ray. A chest x ray creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. The pictures can show whether you have an enlarged heart. This is a sign of excess fluid in your pericardium.\\n                \\nEchocardiography. This painless test uses sound waves to create pictures of your heart. The pictures show the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart is working. This test can show whether fluid has built up in the pericardium.\\n                \\nCardiac CT (computed tomography (to-MOG-rah-fee)). This is a type of x ray that takes a clear, detailed picture of your heart and pericardium. A cardiac CT helps rule out other causes of chest pain.\\n                \\nCardiac MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). This test uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create detailed pictures of your organs and tissues. A cardiac MRI can show changes in the pericardium.\\n                \\nYour doctor also may recommend blood tests. These tests can help your doctor find out whether you've had a heart attack, the cause of your pericarditis, and how inflamed your pericardium is.\", \"Most cases of pericarditis are mild; they clear up on their own or with rest and simple treatment. Other times, more intense treatment is needed to prevent complications. Treatment may include medicines and, less often, procedures or surgery.\\n                \\nThe goals of treatment include:\\n                \\nReducing pain and inflammation\\n                \\nTreating the underlying cause, if it's known\\n                \\nChecking for complications\\n                \\nSpecific Types of Treatment\\n                \\nAs a first step in your treatment, your doctor may advise you to rest until you feel better and have no fever. He or she may tell you to take over-the-counter, anti-inflammatory medicines to reduce pain and inflammation. Examples of these medicines include aspirin and ibuprofen.\\n                \\nYou may need stronger medicine if your pain is severe. If your pain continues to be severe, your doctor may prescribe a medicine called colchicine and, possibly, prednisone (a steroid medicine).\\n                \\nIf an infection is causing your pericarditis, your doctor will prescribe an antibiotic or other medicine to treat the infection.\\n                \\nYou may need to stay in the hospital during treatment for pericarditis so your doctor can check you for complications.\\n                \\nThe symptoms of acute pericarditis can last from a few days to 3 weeks. Chronic pericarditis may last several months.\\n                \\nOther Types of Treatment\\n                \\nYou may need treatment for complications of pericarditis. Two serious complications are cardiac tamponade and chronic constrictive pericarditis.\\n                \\nCardiac tamponade is treated with a procedure called pericardiocentesis (per-ih-KAR-de-o-sen-TE-sis). A needle or tube (called a catheter) is inserted into the chest wall to remove excess fluid in the pericardium. This procedure relieves pressure on the heart.\\n                \\nThe only cure for chronic constrictive pericarditis is surgery to remove the pericardium. This is known as a pericardiectomy (PER-i-kar-de-EK-to-me).\\n                \\nThe treatments for these complications require hospital stays.\", \"You usually can't prevent acute pericarditis. You can take steps to reduce your chance of having another acute episode, having complications, or getting chronic pericarditis.\\n                \\nThese steps include getting prompt treatment, following your treatment plan, and having ongoing medical care (as your doctor advises).\", \"Research suggests thatcoronary heart disease(CHD) begins with damage to the lining and inner layers of the coronary (heart) arteries. Several factors contribute to this damage. They include:\\n                \\nSmoking, including secondhand smoke\\n                \\nHigh amounts of certain fats andcholesterol in the blood\\n                \\nHigh blood pressure\\n                \\nHigh amounts of sugar in the blood due to insulin resistance or diabetes\\n                \\nBlood vessel inflammation\\n                \\nPlaque may begin to build up where the arteries are damaged. The buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries may start in childhood.\\n                \\nOver time, plaque can harden or rupture (break open). Hardened plaque narrows the coronary arteries and reduces the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart. This can cause chest pain or discomfort calledangina.\\n                \\nIf the plaque ruptures, blood cell fragments called platelets (PLATE-lets) stick to the site of the injury. They may clump together to form blood clots.\\n                \\nBlood clots can further narrow the coronary arteries and worsenangina. If a clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block a coronary artery and cause a heart attack.\\n                \\nIn addition to the factors above, low estrogen levels before or after menopause may play a role in causingcoronary microvascular disease(MVD). Coronary MVD is heart disease that affects the heart's tiny arteries.\\n                \\nThe cause of broken heart syndrome isn't yet known. However, a sudden release of stress hormones may play a role in causing the disorder. Most cases of broken heart syndrome occur in women who have gone through menopause.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283465.750231}
