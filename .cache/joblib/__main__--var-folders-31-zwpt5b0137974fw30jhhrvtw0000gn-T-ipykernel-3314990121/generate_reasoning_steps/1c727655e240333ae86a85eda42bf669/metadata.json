This single mutation is sufficient to reduce the activity of an enzyme needed for heme production, which increases the risk of developing signs and symptoms of porphyria. Autosomal dominant porphyrias include acute intermittent porphyria, most cases of erythropoietic protoporphyria, hereditary coproporphyria, and variegate porphyria. Although the gene mutations associated with some cases of porphyria cutanea tarda also have an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, most people with this form of porphyria do not have an inherited gene mutation.  Other porphyrias are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. Porphyrias with an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance include ALAD deficiency porphyria, congenital erythropoietic porphyria, and some cases of erythropoietic protoporphyria.  When erythropoietic protoporphyria is caused by mutations in the ALAS2 gene, it has an X-linked dominant pattern of inheritance. The ALAS2 gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell may be sufficient to cause the disorder. In males (who have only one X chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes the disorder. Males may experience more severe symptoms of the disorder than females. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.  Mutations in the UROD gene are related to both porphyria cutanea tarda and hepatoerythropoietic porphyria. Individuals who inherit one altered copy of the UROD gene are at increased risk for porphyria cutanea tarda. (Multiple genetic and nongenetic factors contribute to this condition.) People who inherit two altered copies of the UROD gene in each cell develop hepatoerythropoietic porphyria.', 'These resources address the diagnosis or management of porphyria:  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Acute Intermittent Porphyria  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Congenital Erythropoietic Porphyria  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Erythropoietic Protoporphyria, Autosomal Recessive  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Hereditary Coproporphyria  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Porphyria Cutanea Tarda, Type II  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Variegate Porphyria  - Gene Review: Gene Review: X-Linked Protoporphyria  - Genetic Testing Registry: Acute intermittent porphyria  - Genetic Testing Registry: Congenital erythropoietic porphyria  - Genetic Testing Registry: Erythropoietic protoporphyria  - Genetic Testing Registry: Familial porphyria cutanea tarda  - Genetic Testing Registry: Hereditary coproporphyria  - Genetic Testing Registry: Porphyria  - Genetic Testing Registry: Protoporphyria, erythropoietic, X-linked  - Genetic Testing Registry: Variegate porphyria  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Porphyria  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Porphyria cutanea tarda on the hands  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Porphyrins - Blood  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Porphyrins - Urine   These resources from MedlinePlus offer information about the diagnosis and management of various health conditions:  - Diagnostic Tests  - Drug Therapy  - Surgery and Rehabilitation  - Genetic Counseling   - Palliative Care', 'CHST3-related skeletal dysplasia is a genetic condition characterized by bone and joint abnormalities that worsen over time. Affected individuals have short stature throughout life, with an adult height under 4 and a half feet. Joint dislocations, most often affecting the knees, hips, and elbows, are present at birth (congenital). Other bone and joint abnormalities can include an inward- and upward-turning foot (clubfoot), a limited range of motion in large joints, and abnormal curvature of the spine. The features of CHST3-related skeletal dysplasia are usually limited to the bones and joints; however, minor heart defects have been reported in a few affected individuals.  Researchers have not settled on a preferred name for this condition. It is sometimes known as autosomal recessive Larsen syndrome based on its similarity to another skeletal disorder called Larsen syndrome. Other names that have been used to describe the condition include spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, Omani type; humero-spinal dysostosis; and chondrodysplasia with multiple dislocations. Recently, researchers have proposed the umbrella term CHST3-related skeletal dysplasia to refer to bone and joint abnormalities resulting from mutations in the CHST3 gene.', 'The prevalence of CHST3-related skeletal dysplasia is unknown. More than 30 affected individuals have been reported.']}"}, "time": 1746283454.156939}
