There are several types of Haemophilus. They can cause different types of illnesses involving breathing, bones and joints, and the nervous system.    One common type, Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b), causes serious disease. It usually strikes children under 5 years old. Your child can get Hib disease by being around other children or adults who may have the bacteria and not know it. The germs spread from person to person. If the germs stay in the child's nose and throat, the child probably will not get sick. But sometimes the germs spread into the lungs or the bloodstream, and then Hib can cause serious problems such as meningitis and pneumonia.    There is a vaccine to prevent Hib disease. All children younger than 5 years of age should be vaccinated with the Hib vaccine.    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\", 'Summary : Flu is a respiratory infection caused by a number of viruses. Most people with the flu get better on their own. But it can be serious. It can cause complications and sometimes even death. Getting the flu vaccine every year is the best way to lower your chance of getting the flu and spreading it to others.    The flu vaccine causes antibodies to develop in your body about two weeks after you get it. These antibodies provide protection against infection with the viruses that are in the vaccine.    Flu vaccines can either be shots or nasal sprays. There is also a high-dose version for people 65 and older. Ask your health care provider which one is right for you.    Everyone 6 months of age and older should get a flu vaccine every season. People with egg allergies should check with their doctors before getting a vaccine. Other exceptions are people who have       - Had reactions to flu shots before    - Guillain-Barre Syndrome    - A fever       Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', \"Summary : Preventing fires is an important part of fire safety. In the United States, cooking is the main cause of home fires. Cigarettes are a big risk too - they are the leading cause of fire deaths. Here are some fire prevention tips:       - Don't leave the stove or oven unattended when they are on    - Don't let children use kitchen appliances unsupervised    - Don't smoke in bed    - Make sure your electrical appliances and cords are in good condition       It is also important to be prepared in case there is a fire. Make sure that you have working smoke detectors on every floor and in every bedroom. You should also have fire extinguishers on every floor and in your kitchen. Make and practice an escape plan in case the main exit is blocked.\", 'Your esophagus is the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) happens when a muscle at the end of your esophagus does not close properly. This allows stomach contents to leak back, or reflux, into the esophagus and irritate it.     You may feel a burning in the chest or throat called heartburn. Sometimes, you can taste stomach fluid in the back of the mouth. If you have these symptoms more than twice a week, you may have GERD. You can also have GERD without having heartburn. Your symptoms could include a dry cough, asthma symptoms, or trouble swallowing.    Anyone, including infants and children, can have GERD. If not treated, it can lead to more serious health problems. In some cases, you might need medicines or surgery. However, many people can improve their symptoms by       - Avoiding alcohol and spicy, fatty or acidic foods that trigger heartburn    - Eating smaller meals    - Not eating close to bedtime     - Losing weight if needed     - Wearing loose-fitting clothes       NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases']}"}, "time": 1746283466.77865}
