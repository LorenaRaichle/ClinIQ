The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Multicentric osteolysis nephropathy. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the metacarpal bones 90% Decreased body weight 90% EMG abnormality 90% Gait disturbance 90% Limitation of joint mobility 90% Proptosis 90% Proteinuria 90% Skeletal muscle atrophy 90% Slender long bone 90% Triangular face 90% Camptodactyly of finger 50% Nephropathy 50% Abnormality of epiphysis morphology 7.5% Downturned corners of mouth 7.5% Polyhydramnios 7.5% Telecanthus 7.5% Wide nasal bridge 7.5% Ankle swelling - Arthralgia - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Carpal osteolysis - Hypertension - Hypoplasia of the maxilla - Metacarpal osteolysis - Metatarsal osteolysis - Osteolysis involving tarsal bones - Osteopenia - Pes cavus - Renal insufficiency - Ulnar deviation of the hand or of fingers of the hand - Wrist swelling - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Osteogenesis imperfecta type III (OI type III) is a form of osteogenesis imperfecta, a group of genetic conditions that primarily affect the bones. In OI type III, specifically, a diagnosis can often be made shortly after birth as fractures (broken bones) during the newborn period simply from handling the infant are common. Other signs and symptoms vary significantly from person to person but may include severe bone fragility, bone malformations, short stature, dental problems (dentinogenesis imperfect), macrocephaly (unusually large head), hearing loss, and blue sclerae (whites of the eyes). Most affected people are unable to walk without assistance. OI type III is caused by changes (mutations) in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Osteogenesis imperfecta type III?

The cause of this condition is not known, although it may be passed down through families in some cases. This condition occurs in about 1 out of every 1,000 births. Treatment may involve moving the foot into the correct position and using a cast to keep it there. This process is done in small increments over a period of time. In severe cases, surgery may be needed.']}"}, "time": 1746283456.363195}
