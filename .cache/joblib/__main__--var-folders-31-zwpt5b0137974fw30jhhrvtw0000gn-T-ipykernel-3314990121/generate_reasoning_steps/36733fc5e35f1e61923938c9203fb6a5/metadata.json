The cause of florid cemento-osseous dysplasia is not known. This condition is usually not familial (i.e., does not tend to run in families), however a rare familial form has been described in a few families. In these families the condition affected younger individuals, and the rate of lesion growth was rapid.', \"How is florid cemento-osseous dysplasia diagnosed? Diagnosis of cemento-osseous dysplasia relies on the radiographic findings of the lesions as well as the clinical signs and symptoms. Careful assessment and examination must be made to differentiate cemento-osseous dysplasia from other lesions with similar appearance, namely Paget's disease, chronic diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis, fibrous dysplasia, osteosarcoma, periapical cemental dysplasia.\", 'How might florid cemento-osseous dysplasia be treated? In many cases florid cemento-osseous dysplasia does not require treatment, however careful follow-up may be warranted. When the condition causes discomfort, pain, or disfigurement, the treatment plan is tailored to the patient. The following article describes the treatment of florid cemento-osseous dysplasia in one patient. We recommend that you speak with your dentist to learn more about your treatment options and for referrals to local specialists. Minhas G, Hodge T, Gill DS.

Such facilities often have access to up-to-date testing and technology, a large group of health care providers and specialists to consult with, and research opportunities.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Diffuse panbronchiolitis? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Diffuse panbronchiolitis. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Bronchiectasis - Cough - Hypoxemia - Progressive - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.']}"}, "time": 1746283460.901658}
