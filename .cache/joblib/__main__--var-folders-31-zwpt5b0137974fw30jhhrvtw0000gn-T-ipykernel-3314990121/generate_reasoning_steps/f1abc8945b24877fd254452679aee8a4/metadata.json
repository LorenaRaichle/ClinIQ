Nearly 7 million people in the United States have type 2 diabetes and dont know they have the disease. Many have no signs or symptoms. Some people have symptoms but do not suspect diabetes.\\n                \\nSymptoms include\\n                \\n- increased thirst  - increased hunger  - fatigue  - increased urination, especially at night  - unexplained weight loss  - blurred vision  - numbness or tingling in the feet or hands  - sores that do not heal\\n                \\nMany people do not find out they have the disease until they have diabetes problems, such as blurred vision or heart trouble. If you find out early that you have diabetes, you can get treatment to prevent damage to your body.', 'To find out your risk for type 2 diabetes, check each item that applies to you.\\n                \\n- I am age 45 or older.  - I am overweight or obese.  - I have a parent, brother, or sister with diabetes.  - My family background is African American, Alaska Native, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, or Pacific Islander American.  - I have had gestational diabetes.  - I gave birth to at least one baby weighing more than 9 pounds.  - My blood pressure is 140/90 or higher, or I have been told that I have high blood pressure.  - My cholesterol levels are higher than normal. My HDL, or good, cholesterol is below 35, or my triglyceride level is above 250.  - I am fairly inactive.  - I have polycystic ovary syndrome, also called PCOS.  - On previous testing, I had prediabetesan A1C level of 5.7 to 6.4 percent, impaired fasting glucose (IFG), or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).  - I have other clinical conditions associated with insulin resistance, such as a condition called acanthosis nigricans, characterized by a dark, velvety rash around my neck or armpits.  - I have a history of cardiovascular disease.\\n                \\nThe more items you checked, the higher your risk.\\n                \\n\\n                \\nDoes sleep matter?   Yes. Studies show that untreated sleep problems, especially sleep apnea, can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. Sleep apnea is a common disorder in which you have pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep. Most people who have sleep apnea dont know they have it and it often goes undiagnosed. Night shift workers who have problems with sleepiness may also be at increased risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes.   If you think you might have sleep problems, ask your doctor for help.
