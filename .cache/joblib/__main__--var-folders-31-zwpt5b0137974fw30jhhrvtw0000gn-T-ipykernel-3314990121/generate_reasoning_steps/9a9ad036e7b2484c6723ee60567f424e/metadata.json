The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Autosomal dominant neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 4B. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Adult onset - Ataxia - Auditory hallucinations - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Curvilinear intracellular accumulation of autofluorescent lipopigment storage material - Dementia - Depression - Fingerprint intracellular accumulation of autofluorescent lipopigment storage material - Granular osmiophilic deposits (GROD) in cells - Increased neuronal autofluorescent lipopigment - Myoclonus - Parkinsonism - Rapidly progressive - Rectilinear intracellular accumulation of autofluorescent lipopigment storage material - Seizures - Visual hallucinations - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'AL amyloidosisis the most common form of amyloidosis, a group of disorders in which an abnormal protein called amyloid builds up in tissues and organs. The signs and symptoms of AL amyloidosis vary among patients because the build up may occur in the tongue, intestines, muscles, joints, nerves, skin, ligaments, heart, liver, spleen, or kidneys. To diagnose AL amyloidosis, healthcare professionals use blood or urine tests to identify signs of amyloid protein and a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment may include chemotherapy directed at the abnormal plasma cells, stem cell transplantation, or other treatments based on which symptoms have developed.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Fountain syndrome?
