The signs and symptoms of Cohen syndrome may vary greatly from person to person. Some studies have suggested that a large number of people with Cohen syndrome have similar facial features regardless of ethnic background, including thick hair and eyebrows, long eyelashes, wave-shaped palpebral fissures, broad nasal tip, smooth or shortened philtrum, and hypotonic appearance.  Other findings that tend to be more common among almost all people with Cohen syndrome are listed below. Retinal dystrophy (a condition in which the muscles of the retina do not work properly) Progressive high myopia (nearsightedness) Acquired microcephaly (smaller than normal-sized head) Non-progressive mental retardation, global developmental delay Hypotonia Joint hyperextensibility (unusually large range of joint movement) The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Cohen syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'How is Cohen syndrome diagnosed? The diagnosis of Cohen syndrome is based on the symptoms present in the patient, but because the symptoms vary greatly from person to person, no consensus diagnostic criteria exist. Genetic testing is available for COH1, the only gene known to be associated with Cohen syndrome. However, the rate at which mutations are detected via genetic testing varies by ethnicity. For example, the mutation detection rate in COH1 is higher among the Finnish and Old Amish compared to individuals of from other populations.', 'How is Cohen syndrome treated? There is no cure for Cohen syndrome. Treatment is focused on improving or alleviating the signs and symptoms in the patient. Typically, when a person is first diagnosed with Cohen syndrome, he or she will undergo an eye and blood examination. If vision problems are detected, early correction of the problems, usually with glasses, often leads to general improvement of cognitive skills. If neutropenia (a condition in which an abnormally low number of white blood cells called neutrophils are present, which may result in an increased risk for infections)  is discovered when the blood is examined, treatment should be given. Follow-up should include annual eye exams and repeat testing of white blood cell count. Early intervention and physical, occupational, and speech therapy can address developmental delay, hypotonia, joint hyperextensibility, and motor clumsiness.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Onychodystrophy-anonychia?
