They often occur after exercise or at night, lasting a few seconds to several minutes. It is a very common muscle problem.     Muscle cramps can be caused by nerves that malfunction. Sometimes this malfunction is due to a health problem, such as a spinal cord injury or a pinched nerve in the neck or back. Other causes are       - Straining or overusing a muscle    - Dehydration    - A lack of minerals in your diet or the depletion of minerals in your body    - Not enough blood getting to your muscles       Cramps can be very painful. Stretching or gently massaging the muscle can relieve this pain.', 'Summary : Whether a fire happens in your home or in the wild, it can be very dangerous. Fire spreads quickly. There is no time to gather valuables or make a phone call. In just two minutes, a fire can become life-threatening. In five minutes, a home can be engulfed in flames.    Heat and smoke from fire can be more dangerous than the flames. Inhaling the super-hot air can burn your lungs. Fire produces poisonous gases that make you disoriented and drowsy. Instead of being awakened by a fire, you may fall into a deeper sleep. You can suffocate or be burned.    Preventing fires is an important part of fire safety. Although there are no guarantees of safety during a fire, you can take actions to protect yourself. You should have a disaster plan. Being prepared can help reduce fear, anxiety, and losses. If you do experience a disaster, it is normal to feel stressed. You may need help in finding ways to cope.

You can help stop the spread of germs by       - Covering your mouth and nose when you sneeze or cough. Sneeze or cough into your elbow, not your hands.    - Cleaning your hands often - always before you eat or prepare food, and after you use the bathroom or change a diaper     - Avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth       Hand washing is one of the most effective and most overlooked ways to stop disease. Soap and water work well to kill germs. Wash for at least 20 seconds and rub your hands briskly. Disposable hand wipes or gel sanitizers also work well.']}"}, "time": 1746283466.769359}
