The symptoms and severity can vary considerably among people with hemiplegic migraine. Signs and symptoms associated with aura may include: Visual disturbance (e.g. blind spots, flashing lights, zigzag pattern, and double vision) Sensory loss (e.g., numbness or paresthesias of the face or an extremity) Difficulty with speech (which usually occur along with right-sided weakness) Motor weakness involves areas affected by sensory symptoms and varies from mild clumsiness to complete deficit. Affected people may also experience neurologic symptoms such as confusion, drowsiness, impaired consciousness, coma, psychosis, and/or memory loss. Neurologic symptoms can last for hours to days. Attention and memory loss can last weeks to months. However, permanent motor, sensory, language, or visual symptoms are extremely rare. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Familial hemiplegic migraine type 2. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of movement 90% Hemiplegia/hemiparesis 90% Incoordination 50% Nystagmus 50% Abnormality of retinal pigmentation 7.5% EEG abnormality 7.5% Neurological speech impairment 7.5% Sensorineural hearing impairment 7.5% Aphasia - Apraxia - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Blurred vision - Coma - Confusion - Diplopia - Drowsiness - Dysarthria - Dysphasia - Episodic ataxia - Fever - Hemiparesis - Hemiplegia - Incomplete penetrance - Intellectual disability - Migraine with aura - Seizures - Transient unilateral blurring of vision - Vertigo - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'How might hemiplegic migraine be treated? Treatment of hemiplegic migraine varies depending on severity and which symptoms are most problematic for the patient. In general, treatments aim to manage symptoms. Drugs that are effective in the prevention of common migraines may be used in hemiplegic migraine. Prophylactic management is applied to patients with frequent, long lasting, or severe attacks. Examples of migraine drugs that have been tried with variable success in people with hemiplegic migraine, include oral verapamil, acetazolamide, lamotrigine. There are a few articles describing the use of nasal administration of ketamine, intravenous verapamil, and triptans for treatment of aura in people with hemiplegic migraine. Use of triptans in hemiplegic migraine is controversial and may be contraindicated in people with severe attacks. For further information on these and other treatments, we recommend that you speak with your healthcare provider.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Seminoma? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Seminoma. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition.

The severity of the condition and the associated symptoms vary significantly from person to person, even within a single family. Features of the condition are generally present at birth and may include skeletal abnormalities (particularly at the ends of long bones), sclerosis (hardening) of the craniofacial bones, macrocephaly (unusually large head size), and characteristic facial features. Some affected people may also have developmental delay, hearing loss, heart defects and/or ophthalmoplegia (paralysis of the muscles surrounding the eyes). Osteopathia striata cranial sclerosis is caused by changes (mutations) in the WTX gene and is inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.']}"}, "time": 1746283459.3272388}
