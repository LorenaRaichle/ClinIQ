The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Osteoarthropathy of fingers familial. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of epiphysis morphology 90% Brachydactyly syndrome 50% Limitation of joint mobility 50% Abnormality of the metaphyses 7.5% Autosomal dominant inheritance - Broad phalanx - Short phalanx of finger - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Tarsal tunnel syndrome is a nerve disorder that is characterized by pain in the ankle, foot, and toes. This condition is caused by compression of the posterior tibial nerve, which runs through a canal near the heel into the sole of the foot. When tissues around this nerve become inflamed, they can press on the nerve and cause the pain associated with tarsal tunnel syndrome.', 'What symptoms are commonly seen in tarsal tunnel syndrome? The symptoms of tarsal tunnel syndrome can vary from person to person. The most common symptom of tarsal tunnel syndrome is foot and ankle pain. Individuals may also experience a burning or tingling sensation and numbness. These symptoms may occur when a person stands, walks, or wears a particular type of shoe. Pain usually worsens during walking and is relieved by rest.', 'What causes tarsal tunnel syndrome? There are a variety of factors that may cause tarsal tunnel syndrome. These may include repetitive stress with activities, trauma (e.g., crush injury, stretch injury, fractures, ankle dislocations or sprains), flat feet, and excess weight. Additionally, any lesion that occupies space within the tarsal tunnel region may cause pressure on the nerve and subsequent symptoms. Examples include tendonitis, hematoma, tumor, varicose veins, and lower extremity edema.']}"}, "time": 1746283457.820658}
