Most cases of jejunal atresia occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. However, it can rarely affect more than one family member. In these families, jejunal atresia is likely due to a genetic cause and appears to be inherited in an autosomal recessive or multifactorial manner.', 'How is jejunal atresia diagnosed? In some cases, jejunal atresia may be diagnosed before birth on a prenatal ultrasound. After birth, a diagnosis is often suspected based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms. Additional testing such as X-rays with or without contrast can then be ordered to confirm the diagnosis.', 'How might jejunal atresia be treated? Jejunal atresia is typically treated with surgery. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is generally necessary for a period of time following surgery until normal meals are tolerated.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Split hand urinary anomalies spina bifida? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Split hand urinary anomalies spina bifida. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the upper urinary tract 90% Finger syndactyly 90% Abnormality of the antitragus 50% Abnormality of the palate 50% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the nipples 50% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the radius 50% Congenital diaphragmatic hernia 50% Edema 50% Low-set, posteriorly rotated ears 50% Myelomeningocele 50% Patent ductus arteriosus 50% Proximal placement of thumb 50% Sloping forehead 50% Spina bifida occulta 50% Split foot 50% Split hand 50% Thickened skin 50% Toe syndactyly 50% Upslanted palpebral fissure 50% Asymmetric growth 7.5% Hydrocephalus 7.5% Talipes 7.5% Tracheoesophageal fistula 7.5% Webbed neck 7.5% Abnormality of the diaphragm - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Cutaneous finger syndactyly - Hydronephrosis - Thoracolumbar scoliosis - Ureteral atresia - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.']}"}, "time": 1746283454.817055}
