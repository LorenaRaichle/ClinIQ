Depending on the genetic cause of dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD), it may be inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner. When DRD is caused by mutations in the GCH1 gene, it is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that having a mutation in only one of the 2 copies of the gene is enough to cause signs and symptoms of the disorder. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from an affected parent; other cases result from having a new (de novo) mutation in the gene. When a person with an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit the mutated gene. Some people who inherit a mutated GCH1 gene never develop features of DRD; this phenomenon is known as reduced penetrance. When DRD is caused by mutations in the TH gene, it is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that a person must have mutations in both of their copies of the gene to be affected. The parents of a person with an autosomal recessive condition usually each carry one copy of the mutated gene and are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not have signs or symptoms. When parents who are both carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected, a 50% chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent, and a 25% chance to be unaffected and not be a carrier. When DRD is caused by mutations in the SPR gene, it can be inherited in an autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant manner.', 'How is dopa-responsive dystonia diagnosed? Dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) is diagnosed based on the signs and symptoms present, results of laboratory tests (sometimes including genetic testing), and response to therapy with levodopa. If DRD is suspected, a therapeutic trial with low doses of levodopa remains the most practical approach to the diagnosis. It is generally agreed that people with childhood-onset dystonia of unknown cause should be treated initially with levodopa. The characteristic symptoms and response to treatment are sufficient to establish the diagnosis for people with the most common form, autosomal dominant DRD. There is only one gene in which mutations are known to cause this form of DRD, but not all people with the disorder are found to have a mutation in the responsible gene. While finding a mutation may provide information about prognosis, it does not alter the treatment. Other types of laboratory tests, such as measuring specific substances or enzymes in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), may be useful to support the diagnosis. For tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency, an autosomal recessive genetic cause of DRD, molecular genetic testing has confirmed the presence of mutations in all affected people to date. Specific laboratory tests performed on CSF help support the diagnosis but are not diagnostic on their own. For sepiapterin reductase deficiency, a very rare autosomal recessive form of DRD, there are distinctive findings in CSF and reduced or absent activity of sepiapterin reductase in fibroblasts. Molecular genetic testing can identify mutations in the responsible gene and confirm the diagnosis of this form of DRD. The major conditions that may have a similar presentation to DRD and are part of the differential diagnosis include early-onset parkinsonism, early-onset primary dystonia, and cerebral palsy or spastic paraplegia. People with specific questions about being evaluated for any form of dystonia should speak with a neurologist or other health care provider.', 'Senior Loken syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by the combination of two specific features: a kidney condition called nephronophthisis and an eye condition known as Leber congenital amaurosis. It can be caused by mutations in one of at least six genes. The proteins produced from these genes are known or suspected to play roles in cell structures called cilia. These microscopic, finger-like projections stick out on the surface of cells and are involved in signaling pathways that transmit information between cells. Cilia are important for the structure and function of many types of cells, including certain cells in the kidneys. They are also necessary for the perception of sensory input (such as vision, hearing, and smell). Senior Loken syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Senior Loken Syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Senior Loken Syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of retinal pigmentation 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Hypertension 90% Multicystic kidney dysplasia 90% Polycystic kidney dysplasia 90% Short stature 90% Visual impairment 90% Abnormality of the renal tubule 50% Abnormality of bone mineral density 7.5% Cataract 7.5% Cone-shaped epiphysis 7.5% Congenital hepatic fibrosis 7.5% Incoordination 7.5% Anemia - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Heterogeneous - Nephronophthisis - Polydipsia - Polyuria - Stage 5 chronic kidney disease - Tapetoretinal degeneration - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.']}"}, "time": 1746283454.9542432}
