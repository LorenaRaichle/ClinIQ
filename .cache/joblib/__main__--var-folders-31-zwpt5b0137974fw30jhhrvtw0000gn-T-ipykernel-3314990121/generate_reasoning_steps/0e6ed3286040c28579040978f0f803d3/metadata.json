This early fusion prevents the skull from growing normally and affects the shape of the head and face. Beare-Stevenson cutis gyrata syndrome is caused by mutations in the FGFR2 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, although all reported cases have resulted from new mutations in the gene and occurred in people with no history of the disorder in their family.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Beare-Stevenson cutis gyrata syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Beare-Stevenson cutis gyrata syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the pancreas 90% Acanthosis nigricans 90% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the earlobes 90% Choanal atresia 90% Depressed nasal bridge 90% Dolichocephaly 90% Hearing abnormality 90% Hypoplasia of the zygomatic bone 90% Macrotia 90% Malar flattening 90% Melanocytic nevus 90% Palmoplantar keratoderma 90% Proptosis 90% Ptosis 90% Reduced number of teeth 90% Respiratory insufficiency 90% Visceral angiomatosis 90% Bifid scrotum 50% Craniosynostosis 50% Abnormality of the nail 7.5% Anteverted nares 7.5% Cleft palate 7.5% Cryptorchidism 7.5% Hydrocephalus 7.5% Hypertelorism 7.5% Hypertension 7.5% Narrow mouth 7.5% Optic atrophy 7.5% Thickened helices 7.5% Umbilical hernia 7.5% Agenesis of corpus callosum - Anteriorly placed anus - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Choanal stenosis - Cloverleaf skull - Hypoplasia of midface - Limited elbow extension - Low-set, posteriorly rotated ears - Narrow palate - Palmoplantar cutis laxa - Preauricular skin furrow - Prominent scrotal raphe - Respiratory distress - Small nail - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', '22q11.2 duplication syndrome is a condition caused by an extra copy of a small piece of chromosome 22 which contains about 30 to 40 genes. The features of this condition vary widely, even among members of the same family (intrafamilial variability). Affected individuals may have intellectual or learning disability, developmental delay, slow growth leading to short stature, and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Many people with the condition have no apparent physical or intellectual disabilities. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, with about 70% genes of affected individuals inheriting the condition from a parent. In other cases it occurs as a de novo mutation (new genetic change) in an individual; however, individuals with a de novo mutation can can pass the duplication to their children. Researchers are working to determine which duplicated genes may contribute to the developmental delay and other problems that sometimes affect people with this condition. Duplication is not detectable by karyotype and most of the people with 22q11.2 duplication syndrome are identified by a special technique known as chromosomal microarray. Treatment depends on the symptoms and includes an individualized educational program. Read more out chromosome 22.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of 22q11.2 duplication syndrome?
