The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Acrocephalopolydactylous dysplasia. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Omphalocele 30% Pancreatic fibrosis 30% Abnormality of the pinna - Ascites - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Craniosynostosis - Cystic renal dysplasia - Enlarged kidneys - Epicanthus - Extrapulmonary sequestrum - Hepatic fibrosis - Hepatomegaly - Hypertelorism - Hypoplasia of the small intestine - Hypoplastic colon - Low-set ears - Micromelia - Oxycephaly - Phenotypic variability - Polysplenia - Postaxial hand polydactyly - Pulmonary hypoplasia - Short neck - Short nose - Upslanted palpebral fissure - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Bifid nose with or without anorectal and renal anomalies?

It describes a white plaque that does not rub off and cannot be characterized as any other condition. Though it may occur in any part of the mouth, it generally affects the tongue, gums, and inner cheek. Physicians will usually biopsy oral leukoplakia lesions as 20-40% of cases are precancerous or cancerous at the time of biopsy and another 8-15% become cancerous over time. The exact cause of oral leukoplakia is not known. Factors that may increase the risk of developing oral leukoplakia include smoking, alcohol use, vitamin deficiencies, malocclusion, and a weakened immune system.Treatment depends on the biopsy results and the size, appearance, and location of the oral leukoplakia. Removal or ablation of the lesion by surgery, laser, or cryotherapy (use of low temperature) may be recommended.', \"Beta-ketothiolase deficiency is an inherited disorder in which the body cannot effectively process a protein building block (amino acid) called isoleucine. This condition also impairs the body's ability to process ketones, which are molecules produced during the breakdown of fats. Signs and symptoms typically appear between the ages of 6 months and 24 months. Affected children experience episodes of vomiting, dehydration, difficulty breathing, extreme tiredness (lethargy), and occasionally seizures. These episodes, which are called ketoacidotic attacks, sometimes lead to coma. Ketoacidotic attacks are frequently triggered by infections, periods without food (fasting), or increased intake of protein-rich foods. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion and is caused by mutations in the ACAT1 gene.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283457.178189}
