It is a type of aminoaciduria. The condition may be diagnosed based on the results of newborn screening tests. Most people with the condition have no symptoms (asymptomatic). For those who do show symptoms, the onset of the disease is usually between the ages of 3 and 9; occasionally the disease may present in adulthood. Mental development is usually normal, though a few cases with intellectual impairment have been reported. The signs and symptoms of Hartnup disease incude skin photosensitivity, neurologic findings, psychiatric symptoms, and ocular (eye) findings. Hartnup disease is caused by mutations in the SLC6A19 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.[1][2] People with Hartnup disease may benefit from a high-protein diet, protection from sunlight, vitamin supplementation, and avoidance of certain drugs/medications. In some cases, treatment with nicotinamide supplements and tryptophan ethyl ester may be indicated.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Hartnup disease? The signs and symptoms of Hartnup disease may vary and include the following:  Skin findings: sensitivity to sunlight  Neurologic symptoms: ataxia, spasticity, headaches,and hypotonia  Psychiatric symptoms: anxiety, emotional instability, mood changes  Ocular findings: double vision, nystagmus, strabismus, photophobia Symptoms may be triggered by sunlight exposure, fever, drugs, and emotional or physical stress. The episodes of skin and neurologic findings may last for 1-4 weeks before spontaneous remission occurs. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Hartnup disease. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', '15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome is a type of contiguous gene deletion syndrome. Individuals with this microdeletion may have very different signs and symptoms from other affected individuals (even within the same family), or no symptoms at all. Features of the condition may include mild to moderate mental retardation, learning difficulties, or normal intelligence; autism; epilepsy (recurring seizures); and mental illness (such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder). Various dysmorphic (abnormally formed) features have been reported, but there are no consistent physical features among individuals who have the condition. It is caused by a tiny deletion (microdeletion) on the long arm of chromosome 15 that spans at least 6 genes; the features of the syndrome are caused by the absence of these genes, which are usually necessary for normal growth and development. It can be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with reduced penetrance, or can occur as a new (de novo) deletion. Treatment typically focuses on individual signs and symptoms (such as medication for seizures) when possible.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome?
