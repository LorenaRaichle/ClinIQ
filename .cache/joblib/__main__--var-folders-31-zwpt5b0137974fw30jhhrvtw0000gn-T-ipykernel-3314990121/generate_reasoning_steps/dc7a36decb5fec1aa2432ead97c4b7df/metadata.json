Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Pyogenic granuloma are small, reddish bumps on the skin that bleed easily due to an abnormally high number of blood vessels. They typically occur on the hands, arms, or face. While the exact cause of pyogenic granulomas is unknown, they often appear following injury. Pyogenic granuloma is often observed in infancy and childhood, but may also be observed in adults, particularly in pregnant women. Small pyogenic granulomas may go away on their own. Larger lesions are treated with surgery, electrocautery, freezing, or lasers.', 'Romano-Ward syndrome is the most common form of inherited long QT syndrome. Symptoms include arrhythmia, fainting, cardiac arrest, and sudden death. There are six different types of this syndrome, long QT 1 through 6. Each type is caused by a change in a different gene. The most prevalent form of long QT syndrome is long QT type 1. Long QT type 1 is caused by changes in the KCNQ1 gene. Romano-Ward syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Long QT syndrome 1? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Long QT syndrome 1.
