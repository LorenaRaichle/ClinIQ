The vaccine, however, is unavailableor has only recently become availablein many parts of the world. You are at higher risk for hepatitis B if you or your mother was born in a region of the world where hepatitis B is common, meaning 2 percent or more of the population is chronically infected with the hepatitis B virus.1 In most Asian and Pacific Island nations, 8 to 16 percent of the population is chronically infected.2', 'Hepatitis B is called a silent killer because many people have no symptoms, so the disease often progresses unnoticed for years. Unfortunately, many people first learn they have chronic hepatitis B when they develop symptoms of severe liver damage, which include\\n                \\n- yellowish eyes and skin, called jaundice  - a swollen stomach or ankles  - tiredness  - nausea  - weakness  - loss of appetite  - weight loss  - spiderlike blood vessels, called spider angiomas, that develop on the skin', 'Anyone can get hepatitis B, but some people are at higher risk, including\\n                \\n- people who were born to a mother with hepatitis B  - people who have close household contact with someone infected with the hepatitis B virus  - people who have lived in parts of the world where hepatitis B is common, including most Asian and Pacific Island nations  - people who are exposed to blood or body fluids at work  - people on hemodialysis  - people whose sex partner(s) has hepatitis B  - people who have had more than one sex partner in the last 6 months or have a history of sexually transmitted disease  - injection drug users  - men who have sex with men', 'Goodpasture syndrome is a pulmonary-renal syndrome, which is a group of acute illnesses involving the kidneys and lungs. Goodpasture syndrome includes all of the following conditions:\\n                \\n- glomerulonephritisinflammation of the glomeruli, which are tiny clusters of looping blood vessels in the kidneys that help filter wastes and extra water from the blood  - the presence of anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibodies; the GBM is part of the glomeruli and is composed of collagen and other proteins  - bleeding in the lungs\\n                \\nIn Goodpasture syndrome, immune cells produce antibodies against a specific region of collagen. The antibodies attack the collagen in the lungs and kidneys.\\n                \\nErnest Goodpasture first described the syndrome during the influenza pandemic of 1919 when he reported on a patient who died from bleeding in the lungs and kidney failure. Diagnostic tools to confirm Goodpasture syndrome were not available at that time, so it is not known whether the patient had true Goodpasture syndrome or vasculitis. Vasculitis is an autoimmune conditiona disorder in which the bodys immune system attacks the bodys own cells and organsthat involves inflammation in the blood vessels and can cause similar lung and kidney problems.\\n                \\nGoodpasture syndrome is sometimes called anti-GBM disease. However, anti-GBM disease is only one cause of pulmonary-renal syndromes, including Goodpasture syndrome.\\n                \\nGoodpasture syndrome is fatal unless quickly diagnosed and treated.']}"}, "time": 1746283485.6788611}
