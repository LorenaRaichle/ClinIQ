The goal of treatment is to bring blood pressure back to normal to relieve signs and symptoms. Another goal is to manage any underlying condition causing the hypotension.\\n                \\nYour response to treatment depends on your age, overall health, and strength. It also depends on how easily you can stop, start, or change medicines.\\n                \\nIn a healthy person, low blood pressure without signs or symptoms usually isn\\'t a problem and needs no treatment.\\n                \\nIf you have signs or symptoms of hypotension, you should sit or lie down right away. Put your feet above the level of your heart. If your signs or symptoms don\\'t go away quickly, you should seek medical care.\\n                \\nOrthostatic Hypotension\\n                \\nMany treatments are available for orthostatic hypotension. If you have this condition, your doctor may advise making lifestyle changes, such as:\\n                \\nDrinking plenty of fluids, such as water or sports drinks that contain nutrients like sodium and potassium.\\n                \\nDrinking little or no alcohol.\\n                \\nStanding up slowly.\\n                \\nNot crossing your legs while sitting.\\n                \\nSlowly increasing the amount of time you sit up if you\\'ve been immobile for a long time because of a medical condition. The term \"immobile\" refers to not being able to move around very much.\\n                \\nEating small, low-carbohydrate meals if you have postprandial hypotension (a form of orthostatic hypotension).\\n                \\nTalk with your doctor about using compression stockings. These stockings apply pressure to your lower legs. The pressure helps move blood throughout your body.\\n                \\nIf medicine is causing your low blood pressure, your doctor may change the medicine or adjust the dose you take.\\n                \\nSeveral medicines are used to treat orthostatic hypotension. These medicines, which raise blood pressure, include fludrocortisone and midodrine.\\n                \\nNeurally Mediated Hypotension\\n                \\nIf you have neurally mediated hypotension (NMH), you may need to make lifestyle changes. These may include:\\n                \\nAvoiding situations that trigger symptoms, such as standing for long periods. Unpleasant, upsetting, or scary situations also can trigger symptoms.\\n                \\nDrinking plenty of fluids, such as water or sports drinks that contain nutrients like sodium and potassium.\\n                \\nIncreasing your salt intake (as your doctor advises).\\n                \\nLearning to recognize symptoms that occur before fainting and taking action to raise your blood pressure. For example, sitting down and putting your head between your knees or lying down can help raise blood pressure.\\n                \\nIf medicine is causing your hypotension, your doctor may change the medicine or adjust the dose you take. He or she also may prescribe medicine to treat NMH.\\n                \\nChildren who have NHM often outgrow it.\\n                \\nSevere Hypotension Linked to Shock\\n                \\nShock is a life-threatening emergency. People who have shock need prompt treatment from medical personnel. If a person has signs or symptoms of shock, call 911 right away.\\n                \\nThe goals of treating shock are to:\\n                \\nRestore blood flow to the organs as quickly as possible to prevent organ damage\\n                \\nFind and reverse the cause of shock\\n                \\nBlood or special fluids are put into the bloodstream to restore blood flow to the organs. Medicines can help raise blood pressure or make the heartbeat stronger. Depending on the cause of the shock, other treatmentssuch as antibiotics or surgerymay be needed.', \"Palpitations (pal-pi-TA-shuns) are feelings that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, or beating too hard or too fast. You may have these feelings in your chest, throat, or neck. They can occur during activity or even when you're sitting still or lying down.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nMany things can trigger palpitations, including:\\n                \\nStrong emotions\\n                \\nVigorous physical activity\\n                \\nMedicines such as diet pills and decongestants\\n                \\nCaffeine, alcohol, nicotine, and illegal drugs\\n                \\nCertain medical conditions, such as thyroid disease or anemia (uh-NEE-me-uh)\\n                \\nThese factors can make the heart beat faster or stronger than usual, or they can cause premature (extra) heartbeats. In these situations, the heart is still working normally. Thus, these palpitations usually are harmless.\\n                \\nSome palpitations are symptoms of arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs). Arrhythmias are problems with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat.\\n                \\nSome arrhythmias are signs of heart conditions, such as heart attack, heart failure, heart valve disease, or heart muscle disease. However, less than half of the people who have palpitations have arrhythmias.\\n                \\nYou can take steps to reduce or prevent palpitations. Try to avoid things that trigger them (such as stress and stimulants) and treat related medical conditions.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nPalpitations are very common. They usually aren't serious or harmful, but they can be bothersome. If you have them, your doctor can decide whether you need treatment or ongoing care.\", \"Many things can cause palpitations. You may have these feelings even when your heart is beating normally or somewhat faster than normal.\\n                \\nMost palpitations are harmless and often go away on their own. However, some palpitations are signs of a heart problem. Sometimes the cause of palpitations can't be found.\\n                \\nIf you start having palpitations, see your doctor to have them checked.\\n                \\nCauses Not Related to Heart Problems\\n                \\nStrong Emotions\\n                \\nYou may feel your heart pounding or racing during anxiety, fear, or stress. You also may have these feelings if you're having a panic attack.\\n                \\nVigorous Physical Activity\\n                \\nIntense activity can make your heart feel like its beating too hard or too fast, even though it's working normally. Intense activity also can cause occasional premature (extra) heartbeats.\\n                \\nMedical Conditions\\n                \\nSome medical conditions can cause palpitations. These conditions can make the heart beat faster or stronger than usual.

The palpitations will likely improve or go away as these conditions go away or change.\\n                \\nSome palpitations that occur during pregnancy may be due to anemia.\\n                \\nMedicines and Stimulants\\n                \\nMany medicines can trigger palpitations because they can make the heart beat faster or stronger than usual. Medicines also can cause premature (extra) heartbeats.\\n                \\nExamples of these medicines include:\\n                \\nInhaled asthma medicines.\\n                \\nMedicines to treat an underactive thyroid. Taking too much of these medicines can cause an overactive thyroid and lead to palpitations.\\n                \\nMedicines to prevent arrhythmias. Medicines used to treat irregular heart rhythms can sometimes cause other irregular heart rhythms.\\n                \\nOver-the-counter medicines that act as stimulants also may cause palpitations. These include decongestants (found in cough and cold medicines) and some herbal and nutritional supplements.\\n                \\nCaffeine, nicotine (found in tobacco), alcohol, and illegal drugs (such as cocaine and amphetamines) also can cause palpitations.\\n                \\nCauses Related to Heart Problems\\n                \\nSome palpitations are symptoms of arrhythmias. Arrhythmias are problems with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. However, less than half of the people who have palpitations have arrhythmias.\\n                \\nDuring an arrhythmia, the heart can beat too fast, too slow, or with an irregular rhythm. An arrhythmia happens if some part of the heart's electrical system doesn't work as it should.\\n                \\nPalpitations are more likely to be related to an arrhythmia if you:\\n                \\nHave had a heart attack or are at risk for one.\\n                \\nHave coronary heart disease (CHD) or risk factors for CHD.\\n                \\nHave other heart problems, such as heart failure, heart valve disease, or heart muscle disease.\\n                \\nHave abnormal electrolyte levels. Electrolytes are minerals, such as potassium and sodium, found in blood and body fluids. They're vital for normal health and functioning of the body.\", 'Some people may be more likely than others to have palpitations.
