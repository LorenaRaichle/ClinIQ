Other specialists also may be involved in your care, including a:\\n                \\nPulmonologist. This is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating lung diseases.\\n                \\nRadiologist. This is a doctor who is specially trained to supervise x-ray tests and look at x-ray pictures.\\n                \\nSurgeon or oncologist. An oncologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating cancer. The surgeon or oncologist may take a tissue sample from your lungs to study under a microscope.\\n                \\nPathologist. A pathologist is a doctor who specializes in identifying diseases by studying cells and tissues under a microscope. A pathologist may study your tissue sample.\\n                \\nExposure to Asbestos\\n                \\nYour doctor will want to know about your history of asbestos exposure. He or she may ask about your work history and your spouse's or other family members work histories.\\n                \\nYour doctor also may ask about your location and surroundings. For example, he or she may ask about areas of the country where you've lived.\\n                \\nIf you know you were exposed to asbestos, your doctor may ask questions to find out:\\n                \\nHow much asbestos you were exposed to. For example, were you surrounded by visible asbestos dust?\\n                \\nHow long you were exposed to asbestos and how often during that time you were in direct contact with it.\\n                \\nSymptoms\\n                \\nYour doctor may ask whether you have any symptoms, such as shortness of breath or coughing. The symptoms of asbestos-related lung diseases vary. They depend on which disease you have and how much it has damaged your lungs.\\n                \\nYour doctor also may ask whether you smoke. Smoking, along with asbestos exposure, raises your risk for lung cancer.\\n                \\nPhysical Exam\\n                \\nYour doctor will listen to your breathing with a stethoscope to find out whether your lungs are making any strange sounds.\\n                \\nIf you have a pleural effusion with a lot of fluid buildup, your doctor might hear a dull sound when he or she taps on your chest. Or, he or she might have trouble hearing any breathing sounds. If you have asbestosis, your doctor may hear a crackling sound when you breathe in.\\n                \\nYour doctor will check your legs for swelling, which may be a sign of lung-related problems. He or she also will check your fingers and toes for clubbing.\\n                \\nClubbing is the widening and rounding of the fingertips and toes. Clubbing most often is linked to heart and lung diseases that cause lower-than-normal blood oxygen levels.\\n                \\nChest X Ray\\n                \\nA chest x ray is the most common test for detecting asbestos-related lung diseases. This painless test creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as the lungs.\\n                \\nA chest x ray cant detect asbestos fibers in the lungs. However, it can show asbestos-related diseases, such as pleural plaque and pleural effusion. Pleural effusion also can be a sign of a more severe disease, such as mesothelioma.\\n                \\nA chest x ray also can show asbestosis. Often the lung tissue will appear very white on the x-ray pictures. The size, shape, location, and degree of whiteness can help your doctor figure out how much lung damage you have. Severe asbestosis may affect the whole lung and have a honeycomb look on the x-ray pictures.\\n                \\nIf you have lung cancer, a chest x ray may show masses or abnormal fluid.\\n                \\nIf you have mesothelioma, a chest x ray will show thickening of the pleura. The pleura is the tissue around the lungs and diaphragm (the muscle below your lungs). The chest xray also will usually show signs of pleural effusion in people who have mesothelioma.\\n                \\nOther Diagnostic Tests\\n                \\nTo help confirm a chest x-ray finding, or to find out how much lung damage you have, you may have more tests.\\n                \\nChest Computed Tomography Scan\\n                \\nA chest computed tomography (to-MOG-ra-fee) scan, or chest CT scan, is a painless test that creates precise pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your lungs. A CT scan is a type of x ray, but its pictures show more detail than standard chest x-ray pictures.\\n                \\nA chest CT scan may be very helpful for finding asbestosis in its earliest stages, before a standard chest x ray can detect it.\\n                \\nLung Function Tests\\n                \\nLung function tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood.\\n                \\nThese tests can show whether your lung function is impaired. They also can help your doctor track your disease over time.\\n                \\nBiopsy\\n                \\nThe only way to confirm a diagnosis of lung cancer or mesothelioma is for a pathologist to check samples of your lung cells or tissues. A pathologist is a doctor who identifies diseases by studying cells and tissues under a microscope.\\n                \\nDoctors have many ways to collect tissue samples. One way is through bronchoscopy (bron-KOS-ko-pee). For this procedure, your doctor will pass a thin, flexible tube through your nose (or sometimes your mouth), down your throat, and into your airways. He or she will then take a sample of tissue from your lungs.\\n                \\nIf your doctor thinks you have mesothelioma, you may have a thoracoscopy (thor-ah-KOS-ko-pee). For this procedure, you'll be given medicine so you don't feel any pain.\\n                \\nYour doctor will make a small cut through your chest wall. He or she will put a thin tube with a light on it into your chest between two ribs. This allows your doctor to see inside your chest and get tissue samples.\", \"No treatments can reverse the effects of asbestos on your lungs. However, treatments may help relieve symptoms and prevent or delay complications. If you have lung cancer, treatments may help slow the progress of the disease.\\n                \\nTreatments for Pleural Plaque, Pleural Effusion, and Asbestosis\\n                \\nIf you have pleural plaque, pleural effusion, or asbestosis and you smoke, your doctor will advise you to quit smoking. People who have these conditions can lower their risk for lung cancer if they quit smoking.\\n                \\nTalk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.\\n                \\nIf you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.\\n                \\nFor more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes Your Guide to a Healthy Heart. Although these resources focus on heart health, they include general information about how to quit smoking.\\n                \\nIf you have trouble breathing or shortness of breath and a very low blood oxygen level, your doctor may recommend oxygen therapy. For this treatment, you're given oxygen through nasal prongs or a mask. Oxygen therapy may be done at home or in a hospital or other health facility.\\n                \\nIf excess fluid around the lungs (pleural effusion) is making it hard for you to breathe, thoracentesis (THOR-ah-sen-TE-sis) may help. For this procedure, your doctor will insert a thin needle or plastic tube into the space between your lungs and chest wall. He or she will then draw out the excess fluid.\\n                \\nTreatments for Lung Cancer and Mesothelioma\\n                \\nIf you have lung cancer or mesothelioma, your treatment may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and/or targeted therapy. (Targeted therapy uses medicines or other substances to find and attack specific lung cancer cells without harming normal cells.)\\n                \\nYour doctor may prescribe medicines to prevent fluid buildup, ease pain, or relieve other complications of your disease.\\n                \\nIf you have lung cancer or mesothelioma, talk with your doctor about whether you should get flu and pneumonia vaccines. These vaccines can help lower your risk for lung infections.\", 'You can prevent asbestos-related lung diseases by limiting your exposure to asbestos fibers. If your job requires you to work around asbestos, make sure to follow workplace rules for handling it. For example, make sure that air levels are measured, and wear a proper respirator to avoid breathing in asbestos fibers.\\n                \\nIf you live in a house or work in a building that has pipes or other products containing asbestos, you generally dont need to take special precautions. Being around products that contain asbestos isnt a danger, as long as the asbestos is enclosed. This prevents the fibers from getting into the air.\\n                \\nIf you smoke, quit. Smoking greatly increases your risk of lung cancer if you have pleural plaque, pleural effusion, or asbestosis. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.\\n                \\nIf you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.\\n                \\nFor more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes Your Guide to a Healthy Heart. Although these resources focus on heart health, they include general information about how to quit smoking.', \"Bronchopulmonary (BRONG-ko-PUL-mo-NAR-e) dysplasia (dis-PLA-ze-ah), or BPD, is a serious lung condition that affects infants. BPD mostly affects premature infants who need oxygen therapy (oxygen given through nasal prongs, a mask, or a breathing tube).\\n                \\nMost infants who develop BPD are born more than 10 weeks before their due dates, weigh less than 2 pounds (about 1,000 grams) at birth, and have breathing problems. Infections that occur before or shortly after birth also can contribute to BPD.\\n                \\nSome infants who have BPD may need long-term breathing support from nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) machines or ventilators.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nMany babies who develop BPD are born with serious respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). RDS is a breathing disorder that mostly affects premature newborns. These infants' lungs aren't fully formed or aren't able to make enough surfactant (sur-FAK-tant).\\n                \\nSurfactant is a liquid that coats the inside of the lungs. It helps keep them open so an infant can breathe in air once he or she is born.\\n                \\nWithout surfactant, the lungs collapse, and the infant has to work hard to breathe. He or she might not be able to breathe in enough oxygen to support the body's organs. Without proper treatment, the lack of oxygen may damage the infant's brain and other organs.\\n                \\nBabies who have RDS are treated with surfactant replacement therapy. They also may need oxygen therapy. Shortly after birth, some babies who have RDS also are treated with NCPAP or ventilators (machines that support breathing).\\n                \\nOften, the symptoms of RDS start to improve slowly after about a week. However, some babies get worse and need more oxygen or breathing support from NCPAP or a ventilator.\\n                \\nIf premature infants still require oxygen therapy by the time they reach their original due dates, they're diagnosed with BPD.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nAdvances in care now make it possible for more premature infants to survive. However, these infants are at high risk for BPD.\\n                \\nMost babies who have BPD get better in time, but they may need treatment for months or even years. They may continue to have lung problems throughout childhood and even into adulthood. There's some concern about whether people who had BPD as babies can ever have normal lung function.\\n                \\nAs children who have BPD grow, their parents can help reduce the risk of BPD complications. Parents can encourage healthy eating habits and good nutrition. They also can avoid cigarette smoke and other lung irritants.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283466.558548}
