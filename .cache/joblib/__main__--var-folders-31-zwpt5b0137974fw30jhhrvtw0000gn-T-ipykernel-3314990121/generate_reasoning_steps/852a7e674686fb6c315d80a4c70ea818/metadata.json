There is no established treatment program for HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP).  Corticosteroids may relieve some symptoms, but arent likely to change the course of the disorder.  Clinical studies suggest that interferon alpha provides benefits over short periods and some aspects of disease activity may be improved favorably using interferon beta. Stiff and spastic muscles may be treated with lioresal or tizanidine.  Urinary dysfunction may be treated with oxybutynin.', 'Gray zone lymphoma is a cancer of the immune system.  The name of this lymphoma refers to the fact that cancer cells in this condition are in a \"gray zone\" (an uncertain category) because they appear similar to that of two other types of lymphoma, classical Hodgkin lymphoma and mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma.  Because features of gray zone lymphoma overlap with these two other types of lymphoma, diagnosing this condition can be difficult.  Gray zone lymphoma is most often diagnosed in young adults when an unusual lump (mass) is found in the chest in the space between the lungs (mediastinum).  This condition affects men and women equally.', \"How might gray zone lymphoma be treated? Gray zone lymphoma shares features with two other types of lymphoma, classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) and mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (MLBCL).  Because MLBCL and cHL are treated differently, it is unclear how gray zone lymphoma should be treated.  At this time, there are no guidelines for the best treatment of gray zone lymphoma; treatment is determined based on each individual's diagnosis.  Treatment usually begins with chemotherapy, which may be followed by radiation therapy in some cases.\", 'What are the signs and symptoms of Multiple self healing squamous epithelioma? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Multiple self healing squamous epithelioma. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the skin - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Neoplasm - Onset - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.']}"}, "time": 1746283456.995361}
