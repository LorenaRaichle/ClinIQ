These risk factors can increase your risk for health problems even if they're only moderately raised (borderline-high risk factors).\\n                \\nMost of the metabolic risk factors have no signs or symptoms, although a large waistline is a visible sign.\\n                \\nSome people may have symptoms of high blood sugar if diabetesespecially type 2 diabetesis present. Symptoms of high blood sugar often include increased thirst; increased urination, especially at night; fatigue (tiredness); and blurred vision.\\n                \\nHigh blood pressure usually has no signs or symptoms. However, some people in the early stages of high blood pressure may have dull headaches, dizzy spells, or more nosebleeds than usual.\", 'Your doctor will diagnose metabolic syndrome based on the results of a physical exam and blood tests. You must have at least three of the five metabolic risk factors to be diagnosed with metabolic syndrome.\\n                \\nMetabolic Risk Factors\\n                \\nA Large Waistline\\n                \\nHaving a large waistline means that you carry excess weight around your waist (abdominal obesity). This is also called having an \"apple-shaped\" figure. Your doctor will measure your waist to find out whether you have a large waistline.\\n                \\nA waist measurement of 35 inches or more for women or 40 inches or more for men is a metabolic risk factor. A large waistline means you\\'re at increased risk for heart disease and other health problems.\\n                \\nA High Triglyceride Level\\n                \\nTriglycerides are a type of fat found in the blood. A triglyceride level of 150 mg/dL or higher (or being on medicine to treat high triglycerides) is a metabolic risk factor. (The mg/dL is milligrams per deciliterthe units used to measure triglycerides, cholesterol, and blood sugar.)\\n                \\nA Low HDL Cholesterol Level\\n                \\nHDL cholesterol sometimes is called \"good\" cholesterol. This is because it helps remove cholesterol from your arteries.\\n                \\nAn HDL cholesterol level of less than 50 mg/dL for women and less than 40 mg/dL for men (or being on medicine to treat low HDL cholesterol) is a metabolic risk factor.\\n                \\nHigh Blood Pressure\\n                \\nA blood pressure of 130/85 mmHg or higher (or being on medicine to treat high blood pressure) is a metabolic risk factor. (The mmHg is millimeters of mercurythe units used to measure blood pressure.)\\n                \\nIf only one of your two blood pressure numbers is high, you\\'re still at risk for metabolic syndrome.\\n                \\nHigh Fasting Blood Sugar\\n                \\nA normal fasting blood sugar level is less than 100 mg/dL. A fasting blood sugar level between 100125 mg/dL is considered prediabetes. A fasting blood sugar level of 126 mg/dL or higher is considered diabetes.\\n                \\nA fasting blood sugar level of 100 mg/dL or higher (or being on medicine to treat high blood sugar) is a metabolic risk factor.\\n                \\nAbout 85 percent of people who have type 2 diabetesthe most common type of diabetesalso have metabolic syndrome. These people have a much higher risk for heart disease than the 15 percent of people who have type 2 diabetes without metabolic syndrome.', 'Heart-healthy lifestyle changes are the first line of treatment for metabolic syndrome. Lifestyle changes include heart-healthy eating, losing and maintaining a healthy weight, managing stress, physical activity, and quittingsmoking.\\n                \\nIf lifestyle changes arent enough, your doctor may prescribe medicines. Medicines are used to treat and control risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high triglycerides, low HDL (good) cholesterol, and high blood sugar.\\n                \\nGoals of Treatment\\n                \\nThe major goal of treating metabolic syndrome is to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. Treatment is directed first at lowering LDL cholesterol and high blood pressure and managing diabetes (if these conditions are present).\\n                \\nThe second goal of treatment is to prevent the onset of type2 diabetes, if it hasnt already developed. Long-term complications of diabetes often include heart and kidney disease, vision loss, and foot or leg amputation. If diabetes is present, the goal of treatment is to reduce your risk for heart disease by controlling all of your risk factors.\\n                \\n\\n                \\nHeart-Healthy Lifestyle Changes\\n                \\nHeart-Healthy Eating\\n                \\nHeart-healthy eating is an important part of a heart-healthy lifestyle. Your doctor may recommend heart-healthy eating, which should include:\\n                \\nFat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk\\n                \\nFish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week\\n                \\nFruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes\\n                \\nLegumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans\\n                \\nVegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots\\n                \\nWhole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas\\n                \\nWhen following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating:\\n                \\nA lot of red meat\\n                \\nPalm and coconut oils\\n                \\nSugary foods and beverages\\n                \\nTwo nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise:\\n                \\nSaturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals\\n                \\nTrans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats and meats.\\n                \\nSaturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5percent to 6percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples:\\n                \\nIf you eat:\\n                \\nTry to eat no more than:\\n                \\n1,200 calories a day                     \\n                \\n8 grams of saturated fat a day            \\n                \\n1,500 calories a day\\n                \\n10 grams of saturated fat a day\\n                \\n1,800 calories a day\\n                \\n12 grams of saturated fat a day\\n                \\n2,000 calories a day\\n                \\n13 grams of saturated fat a day\\n                \\n2,500 calories a day\\n                \\n17 grams of saturated fat a day\\n                \\nNot all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterol levels. Some sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are:\\n                \\nAvocados\\n                \\nCorn, sunflower, and soybean oils\\n                \\nNuts and seeds, such as walnuts\\n                \\nOlive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils\\n                \\nPeanut butter\\n                \\nSalmon and trout\\n                \\nTofu\\n                \\nSodium\\n                \\nYou should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.\\n                \\nDietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension\\n                \\nYour doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt.\\n                \\nThe DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH.\\n                \\nLimiting Alcohol\\n                \\nTry to limit alcohol intake. Too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weightgain.\\n                \\nMen should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is:\\n                \\n12 ounces of beer\\n                \\n5 ounces of wine\\n                \\n1 ounces of liquor\\n                \\n\\n                \\nMaintaining a Healthy Weight\\n                \\nIf you have metabolic syndrome and are overweight or obese, your doctor will recommend weight loss. He or she can help you create a weight-loss plan and goals. Maintaining a healthy weight can lower your risk for metabolic syndrome, coronary heart disease, and other health problems. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active.\\n                \\nKnowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBI) online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI:\\n                \\nBelow 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.\\n                \\nBetween 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range.\\n                \\nBetween 25.0 and 29.9 is considered overweight.\\n                \\nOf 30.0 or higher is considered obese.\\n                \\nA general goal to aim for is a BMI of less than 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal.\\n                \\nMeasuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type2 diabetes. This risk may be higher with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men.\\n                \\nIf youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3percent to 5percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL (bad) cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol.\\n                \\n\\n                \\nManaging Stress\\n                \\nLearning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as:\\n                \\nA stress management program\\n                \\nMeditation\\n                \\nPhysical activity\\n                \\nRelaxation therapy\\n                \\nTalking things out with friends or family\\n                \\n\\n                \\nPhysical Activity\\n                \\nRegular physical activity can lower your risk for metabolic syndrome, coronary heart disease, and other health problems. Everyone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1hour and 15minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10minutes at a time spread throughout the week.\\n                \\nTalk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.\\n                \\nRead more about physical activity at:\\n                \\nPhysical Activity and Your Heart\\n                \\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans\\n                \\n\\n                \\nQuitting Smoking\\n                \\nIf you smoke, quit. Smoking can raise your risk for heart disease and heart attack and worsen other heart disease risk factors. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.\\n                \\nIf you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking. For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Smoking and Your Heart Health Topic.\\n                \\n\\n                \\nMedicines\\n                \\nSometimes lifestyle changes arent enough to control your risk factors for metabolic syndrome. For example, you may need statin medications to control or lower your cholesterol. By lowering your blood cholesterol level, you can decrease your chance of having a heart attack or stroke. Doctors usually prescribe statins for people who have:\\n                \\nDiabetes\\n                \\nHeart disease or had a prior stroke\\n                \\nHigh LDL cholesterol levels\\n                \\nDoctors may discuss beginning statin treatment with those who have an elevated risk for developing heart disease or having a stroke.\\n                \\nYour doctor also may prescribe other medications to:\\n                \\nDecrease your chance of having a heart attack or dying suddenly.\\n                \\nLower your blood pressure.\\n                \\nPrevent blood clots, which can lead to heart attack or stroke.\\n                \\nReduce your hearts workload and relieve symptoms of coronary heart disease.\\n                \\nTake all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to. You should still follow a heart-healthy lifestyle, even if you take medicines to treat your risk factors for metabolic syndrome.', 'Making heart-healthy lifestyle choices is the best way to prevent metabolic syndrome by:\\n                \\nBeing physically active\\n                \\nFollowing a heart-healthy eating plan\\n                \\nKnowing your weight, waist measurement, and body mass index\\n                \\nMaintaining a healthy weight\\n                \\nMake sure to schedule routine doctor visits to keep track of your cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar levels. Speak with your doctor about a blood test called a lipoprotein panel, which shows your levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides.']}"}, "time": 1746283466.4945421}
