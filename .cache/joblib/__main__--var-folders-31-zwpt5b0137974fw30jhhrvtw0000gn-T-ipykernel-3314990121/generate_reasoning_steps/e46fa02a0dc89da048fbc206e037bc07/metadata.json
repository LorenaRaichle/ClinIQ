Glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome (GLUT1 deficiency syndrome) is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that to be affected, a person only needs a change (mutation) in one copy of the responsible gene in each cell. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from an affected parent. Other cases may result from new (de novo) mutations in the gene. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. A person with GLUT1 deficiency syndrome has a 50% chance with each pregnancy of passing along the altered gene to his or her child.', 'How is glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome diagnosed? A diagnosis of glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome (GLUT1 deficiency syndrome) is often suspected based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms. Additional testing can then be ordered to confirm the diagnosis. This may include a lumbar puncture, specialized blood tests to measure the blood concentration of glucose and genetic testing.', 'How might glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome be treated? There is currently no cure for glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome (GLUT1 deficiency syndrome); however, a special diet (called a ketogenic diet) may help control symptoms in some affected people. The GLUT1 Deficiency Foundation offers an information page with detailed information regarding the ketogenic diet.

These pigment granules may flow towards the drainage canals of the eye, slowly clogging them and raising the pressure within the eye (intraocular pressure or IOP). This rise in eye pressure can cause damage to the optic nerve (the nerve in the back of the eye that carries visual images to the brain). If the optic nerve becomes damaged, pigment-dispersion syndrome becomes pigmentary glaucoma. This happens in about 30% of cases. Pigment-dispersion syndrome commonly presents between the second and fourth decades, which is earlier than other types of glaucoma. While men and women are affected in equal numbers, men develop pigmentary glaucoma up to 3 times more often than women. Myopia (nearsightedness) appears to be an important risk factor in the development of pigment-dispersion syndrome and is present in up to 80% of affected individuals. The condition may be sporadic or follow an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with reduced penetrance . At least one gene locus on chromosome 7 has been identified. Pigment-dispersion syndrome can be treated with eye drops or other medications. In some cases, laser surgery may be performed.']}"}, "time": 1746283460.768679}
