The baby is taken out through the mother's abdomen. In the United States, about one in four women have their babies this way. Most C-sections are done when unexpected problems happen during delivery. These include       - Health problems in the mother    - The position of the baby     - Not enough room for the baby to go through the vagina    - Signs of distress in the baby       C-sections are also more common among women carrying more than one baby.    The surgery is relatively safe for mother and baby. Still, it is major surgery and carries risks. It also takes longer to recover from a C-section than from vaginal birth. After healing, the incision may leave a weak spot in the wall of the uterus. This could cause problems with an attempted vaginal birth later. However, more than half of women who have a C-section can give vaginal birth later.\", 'Your throat is a tube that carries food to your esophagus and air to your windpipe and larynx (also called the voice box). The technical name for the throat is pharynx.    You can have a sore throat for many reasons. Often, colds and flu cause sore throats. Other causes can include:       - Allergies    - Mononucleosis    - Smoking    - Strep throat    - Tonsillitis - an infection in the tonsils       Treatment depends on the cause. Sucking on lozenges, drinking lots of liquids, and gargling may ease the pain. Over-the-counter pain relievers can also help, but children should not take aspirin.', \"Summary : Many people who chew tobacco or dip snuff think it's safer than smoking. But you don't have to smoke tobacco for it to be dangerous. Chewing or dipping carries risks like       -  Cancer of the mouth    -  Decay of exposed tooth roots    - Pulling away of the gums from the teeth    -  White patches or red sores in the mouth that can turn to cancer       Recent research shows the dangers of smokeless tobacco may go beyond the mouth. It might also play a role in other cancers, heart disease and stroke.     Smokeless tobacco contains more nicotine than cigarettes. Nicotine is a highly addictive drug that makes it hard to stop using tobacco once you start. Having a quit date and a quitting plan can help you stop successfully.

Their main job is to filter wastes and excess water out of your blood to make urine. They also keep the body's chemical balance, help control blood pressure, and make hormones.    Chronic kidney disease (CKD) means that your kidneys are damaged and can't filter blood as they should. This damage can cause wastes to build up in your body. It can also cause other problems that can harm your health. Diabetes and high blood pressure are the most common causes of CKD.    Treatment may include medicines to lower blood pressure, control blood glucose, and lower blood cholesterol. CKD can get worse over time. CKD may lead to kidney failure. The only treatment options for kidney failure are dialysis or a kidney transplantation.    You can take steps to keep your kidneys healthier longer:       - Choose foods with less salt (sodium)    - Keep your blood pressure below 130/80    - Keep your blood glucose in the target range, if you have diabetes       NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\"]}"}, "time": 1746283466.788147}
