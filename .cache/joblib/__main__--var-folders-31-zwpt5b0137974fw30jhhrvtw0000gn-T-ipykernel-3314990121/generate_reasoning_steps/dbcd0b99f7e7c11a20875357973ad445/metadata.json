Muir-Torre-syndrome (MTS) is a variant of Lynch syndrome and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that having only one changed (mutated) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough for a person to develop the condition. When a person with an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit the mutated copy of the responsible gene. It is important to note that people who inherit a mutated gene that causes MTS inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit a mutation in an associated gene will develop cancer. This phenomenon is called reduced penetrance. The majority of people diagnosed with a form of Lynch syndrome have inherited the mutated gene from a parent. However, because not all people with a mutation develop cancer, and the variable age at which cancer may develop, not all people with a mutation have a parent who had cancer. Thus, the family history may appear negative. A positive family history of MTS is identified in roughly 50% of affected people. The percentage of people with Lynch syndrome who have a new mutation in the gene that occurred for the first time (and was not inherited from a parent) is unknown but is estimated to be extremely low.', 'How is Muir-Torre syndrome diagnosed? A person is suspected to have Muir-Torre syndrome (MTS)if he/she has one or more of the following: History of one or more sebaceous tumors Age younger than 60 years at first presentation of sebaceous tumors Personal history of Lynch-related cancers Family history of Lynch-related cancers The presence of specific skin tumors in MTS may lead to the correct diagnosis even in the absence of a clear family history. A person diagnosed with MTS can also have genetic testing to see if they have a mutation in one of the genes known to cause MTS. However, not everyone with Muir-Torre syndrome will have a detectable mutation in one of these genes. Other, unidentified genes may also play a role in the development of the condition.', 'Gaucher disease refers to a group of inherited conditions that affect many organs and tissues in the body. Signs and symptoms vary widely among affected individuals. There are different types of this condition: Gaucher disease perinatal lethal, Gaucher disease type 1, Gaucher disease type 2, and Gaucher disease type 3. Gaucher disease type 1 is the most common form of this condition. Gaucher disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion and is caused by mutations in the GBA gene.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Gaucher disease? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Gaucher disease. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Anemia 90% Hepatomegaly 90% Splenomegaly 90% Abdominal pain 50% Abnormality of temperature regulation 50% Abnormality of the genital system 50% Arthralgia 50% Aseptic necrosis 50% Behavioral abnormality 50% Bone pain 50% Delayed skeletal maturation 50% Developmental regression 50% Feeding difficulties in infancy 50% Incoordination 50% Involuntary movements 50% Oculomotor apraxia 50% Recurrent fractures 50% Reduced bone mineral density 50% Seizures 50% Strabismus 50% Thrombocytopenia 50% Abnormality of coagulation 7.5% Abnormality of extrapyramidal motor function 7.5% Abnormality of skin pigmentation 7.5% Abnormality of the aortic valve 7.5% Abnormality of the macula 7.5% Abnormality of the myocardium 7.5% Abnormality of the pericardium 7.5% Bone marrow hypocellularity 7.5% Cirrhosis 7.5% Cranial nerve paralysis 7.5% Gingival bleeding 7.5% Hearing impairment 7.5% Hematuria 7.5% Hemiplegia/hemiparesis 7.5% Hydrocephalus 7.5% Hydrops fetalis 7.5% Ichthyosis 7.5% Increased antibody level in blood 7.5% Increased bone mineral density 7.5% Limitation of joint mobility 7.5% Mitral stenosis 7.5% Muscular hypotonia 7.5% Opacification of the corneal stroma 7.5% Osteoarthritis 7.5% Osteolysis 7.5% Osteomyelitis 7.5% Proteinuria 7.5% Pulmonary fibrosis 7.5% Pulmonary hypertension 7.5% Respiratory insufficiency 7.5% Restrictive lung disease 7.5% Retinopathy 7.5% Short stature 7.5% Tremor 7.5% Ventriculomegaly 7.5% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.']}"}, "time": 1746283456.357911}
