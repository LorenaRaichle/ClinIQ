These symptoms can persist for months to years and the ulcers often recur. Livedoid vasculopathy lesions appear as painful red or purple marks and spots that may progress to small, tender, irregular ulcers. Symptoms tend to worsen in the winter and summer months, and affect women more often then men. Livedoid vasculopathy may occur alone or in combination with another condition, such as lupus or thrombophilia.', 'How might livedoid vasculopathy be treated? Treatment of livedoid vasculopathy aims to reduce pain, ulceration and scarring. General treatment measures may involve protecting the skin from injury and irritants, removing dead tissue from the ulcers, treating infection with antibiotics, elevating legs, compression therapy, and avoiding smoking and hormonal contraceptives. Treatments will also be given to address any co-occurring conditions such as lupus or thrombophilia. Drugs that aim to improve blood flow or prevent blood clotting may also be considered. Examples of these treatments, include: Antiplatelet agents (e.g. aspirin, dipyridamole) Fibrinolytic agents (e.g. danazol, tissue plasminogen activator) Anticoagulant agents (e.g. subcutaneous heparin injections, oral warfarin) Pentoxifylline Low-dose danazol (200 mg/day orally) Hyperbaric oxygen Pulsed intravenous immunoglobulin Iloprost Ketanserin Psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy Niacin (nicotinic acid) Sulfapyridine Guanethidine Currently there are no established guidelines for treatment. Decisions for treatment are made based on the clinicians clinical experience and specific patient characteristics. We strongly recommend that you discuss this information and your treatment options further with a trusted healthcare professional.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Ichthyosis and male hypogonadism? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Ichthyosis and male hypogonadism. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of metabolism/homeostasis - Anosmia - Congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma - Gonadotropin deficiency - Hyperchromic macrocytic anemia - Hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism - Intellectual disability - Male hypogonadism - Rod-cone dystrophy - Seizures - X-linked inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Pachydermoperiostosis is a rare disorder characterized by clubbing of the fingers and toes; thickening of the skin of the face (pachyderma); excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis); and new bone formation associated with joint pain. Other features may include congenital heart disease and delayed closure of fontanelles. This condition typically appears during childhood or adolescence, often around the time of puberty, and progresses slowly for about ten years. Both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance has been reported. Mutations in the HPGD gene have been found in those with the autosomal recessive form of this condition.']}"}, "time": 1746283455.925202}
