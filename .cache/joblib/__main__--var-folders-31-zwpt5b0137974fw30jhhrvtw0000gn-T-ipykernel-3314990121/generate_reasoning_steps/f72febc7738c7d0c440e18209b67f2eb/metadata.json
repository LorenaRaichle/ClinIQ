Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\\n                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.\", 'Key Points\\n                    - Lip and oral cavity cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the lips or mouth.    - Tobacco and alcohol use can affect the risk of lip and oral cavity cancer.     - Signs of lip and oral cavity cancer include a sore or lump on the lips or in the mouth.     - Tests that examine the mouth and throat are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage lip and oral cavity cancer.    - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Lip and oral cavity cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the lips or mouth.\\n                    The oral cavity includes the following:         - The front two thirds of the tongue.    - The gingiva (gums).    - The buccal mucosa (the lining of the inside of the cheeks).    - The floor (bottom) of the mouth under the tongue.    - The hard palate (the roof of the mouth).    - The retromolar trigone (the small area behind the wisdom teeth).          Most lip and oral cavity cancers start in squamous cells, the thin, flat cells that line the lips and oral cavity. These are called squamous cell carcinomas. Cancer cells may spread into deeper tissue as the cancer grows. Squamous cell carcinoma usually develops in areas of leukoplakia (white patches of cells that do not rub off).    Lip and oral cavity cancer is a type of head and neck cancer.', \"Tobacco and alcohol use can affect the risk of lip and oral cavity cancer. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for lip and oral cavity cancer include the following:         - Using tobacco products.    - Heavy alcohol use.    - Being exposed to natural sunlight or artificial sunlight (such as from tanning beds) over long periods of time.    - Being male.\", 'Signs of lip and oral cavity cancer include a sore or lump on the lips or in the mouth. These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by lip and oral cavity cancer or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:          - A sore on the lip or in the mouth that does not heal.    - A lump or thickening on the lips or gums or in the mouth.    - A white or red patch on the gums, tongue, or lining of the mouth.    - Bleeding, pain, or numbness in the lip or mouth.    - Change in voice.    - Loose teeth or dentures that no longer fit well.    - Trouble chewing or swallowing or moving the tongue or jaw.    - Swelling of jaw.    - Sore throat or feeling that something is caught in the throat.        Lip and oral cavity cancer may not have any symptoms and is sometimes found during a regular dental exam.']}"}, "time": 1746283464.515003}
