Most people who have community-acquired pneumoniathe most common type of pneumoniaare treated at home.\\n                \\nThe goals of treatment are to cure the infection and prevent complications.\\n                \\nGeneral Treatment\\n                \\nIf you have pneumonia, follow your treatment plan, take all medicines as prescribed, and get ongoing medical care. Ask your doctor when you should schedule followup care. Your doctor may want you to have a chest x ray to make sure the pneumonia is gone.\\n                \\nAlthough you may start feeling better after a few days or weeks, fatigue (tiredness) can persist for up to a month or more. People who are treated in the hospital may need at least 3 weeks before they can go back to their normal routines.\\n                \\nBacterial Pneumonia\\n                \\nBacterial pneumonia is treated with medicines called antibiotics. You should take antibiotics as your doctor prescribes. You may start to feel better before you finish the medicine, but you should continue taking it as prescribed. If you stop too soon, the pneumonia may come back.\\n                \\nMost people begin to improve after 1 to 3 days of antibiotic treatment. This means that they should feel better and have fewer symptoms, such as cough and fever.\\n                \\nViral Pneumonia\\n                \\nAntibiotics don't work when the cause of pneumonia is a virus. If you have viral pneumonia, your doctor may prescribe an antiviral medicine to treat it.\\n                \\nViral pneumonia usually improves in 1 to 3 weeks.\\n                \\nTreating Severe Symptoms\\n                \\nYou may need to be treated in a hospital if:\\n                \\nYour symptoms are severe\\n                \\nYou're at risk for complications because of other health problems\\n                \\nIf the level of oxygen in your bloodstream is low, you may receive oxygen therapy. If you have bacterial pneumonia, your doctor may give you antibiotics through an intravenous (IV) line inserted into a vein.\", \"Pneumonia can be very serious and even life threatening. When possible, take steps to prevent the infection, especially if you're in a high-risk group.\\n                \\nVaccines\\n                \\nVaccines are available to prevent pneumococcal pneumonia and the flu. Vaccines can't prevent all cases of infection. However, compared to people who don't get vaccinated, those who do and still get pneumonia tend to have:\\n                \\nMilder cases of the infection\\n                \\nPneumonia that doesn't last as long\\n                \\nFewer serious complications\\n                \\nPneumococcal Pneumonia Vaccine\\n                \\nA vaccine is available to prevent pneumococcal pneumonia. In most adults, one shot is good for at least 5 years of protection. This vaccine often is recommended for:\\n                \\nPeople who are 65 years old or older.\\n                \\nPeople who have chronic (ongoing) diseases, serious long-term health problems, or weak immune systems. For example, this may include people who have cancer, HIV/AIDS, asthma, or damaged or removed spleens.\\n                \\nPeople who smoke.\\n                \\nChildren who are younger than 5 years old.\\n                \\nChildren who are 518 years of age with certain medical conditions, such as heart or lung diseases or cancer. For more information, talk with your child's doctor.\\n                \\nFor more information about the pneumococcal pneumonia vaccine, go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Vaccines and Preventable Diseases: Pneumococcal Vaccination Web page.\\n                \\nInfluenza Vaccine\\n                \\nThe vaccine that helps prevent the flu is good for 1 year. It's usually given in October or November, before peak flu season.\\n                \\nBecause many people get pneumonia after having the flu, this vaccine also helps prevent pneumonia.\\n                \\nFor more information about the influenza vaccine, go to the CDC's Vaccines and Preventable Diseases: Seasonal Influenza (Flu) Vaccination Web page.\\n                \\nHib Vaccine\\n                \\nHaemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) is a type of bacteria that can cause pneumonia and meningitis (men-in-JI-tis). (Meningitis is an infection of the covering of the brain and spinal cord.) The Hib vaccine is given to children to help prevent these infections.\\n                \\nThe vaccine is recommended for all children in the United States who are younger than 5 years old. The vaccine often is given to infants starting at 2 months of age.\\n                \\nFor more information about the Hib vaccine, go to the CDC's Vaccines and Preventable Diseases: Hib Vaccination Web page.\\n                \\nOther Ways To Help Prevent Pneumonia\\n                \\nYou also can take the following steps to help prevent pneumonia:\\n                \\nWash your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based rubs to kill germs.\\n                \\nDon't smoke. Smoking damages your lungs' ability to filter out and defend against germs. For information about how to quit smoking, go to the Health Topics Smoking and Your Heart article. Although this resource focuses on heart health, it includes general information about how to quit smoking.\\n                \\nKeep your immune system strong. Get plenty of rest and physical activity and follow a healthy diet.\\n                \\nIf you have pneumonia, limit contact with family and friends. Cover your nose and mouth while coughing or sneezing, and get rid of used tissues right away. These actions help keep the infection from spreading.\", 'Heart block is a problem that occurs with the heart\\'s electrical system. This system controls the rate and rhythm of heartbeats. (\"Rate\" refers to the number of times your heart beats per minute. \"Rhythm\" refers to the pattern of regular or irregular pulses produced as the heart beats.)\\n                \\nWith each heartbeat, an electrical signal spreads across the heart from the upper to the lower chambers. As it travels, the signal causes the heart to contract and pump blood.\\n                \\nHeart block occurs if the electrical signal is slowed or disrupted as it moves through the heart.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nHeart block is a type of arrhythmia (ah-RITH-me-ah). An arrhythmia is any problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat.\\n                \\nSome people are born with heart block, while others develop it during their lifetimes. If you\\'re born with the condition, it\\'s called congenital (kon-JEN-ih-tal) heart block. If the condition develops after birth, it\\'s called acquired heart block.\\n                \\nDoctors might detect congenital heart block before or after a baby is born. Certain diseases that may occur during pregnancy can cause heart block in a baby. Some congenital heart defects also can cause heart block. Congenital heart defects are problems with the heart\\'s structure that are present at birth. Often, doctors don\\'t know what causes these defects.\\n                \\nAcquired heart block is more common than congenital heart block. Damage to the heart muscle or its electrical system causes acquired heart block. Diseases, surgery, or medicines can cause this damage.\\n                \\nThe three types of heart block are first degree, second degree, and third degree. First degree is the least severe, and third degree is the most severe. This is true for both congenital and acquired heart block.\\n                \\nDoctors use a test called an EKG (electrocardiogram) to help diagnose heart block. This test detects and records the heart\\'s electrical activity. It maps the data on a graph for the doctor to review.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nThe symptoms and severity of heart block depend on which type you have. First-degree heart block may not cause any severe symptoms.\\n                \\nSecond-degree heart block may result in the heart skipping a beat or beats. This type of heart block also can make you feel dizzy or faint.\\n                \\nThird-degree heart block limits the heart\\'s ability to pump blood to the rest of the body. This type of heart block may cause fatigue (tiredness), dizziness, and fainting. Third-degree heart block requires prompt treatment because it can be fatal.\\n                \\nA medical device called a pacemaker is used to treat third-degree heart block and some cases of second-degree heart block. This device uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate. Pacemakers typically are not used to treat first-degree heart block.\\n                \\nAll types of heart block may increase your risk for other arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation (A-tre-al fih-brih-LA-shun). Talk with your doctor to learn more about the signs and symptoms of arrhythmias.', \"Heart block has many causes. Some people are born with the disorder (congenital), while others develop it during their lifetimes (acquired).\\n                \\nCongenital Heart Block\\n                \\nOne form of congenital heart block occurs in babies whose mothers have autoimmune diseases, such as lupus. People who have these diseases make proteins called antibodies that attack and damage the body's tissues or cells.\\n                \\nIn pregnant women, antibodies can cross the placenta. (The placenta is the organ that attaches the umbilical cord to the mother's womb.) These proteins can damage the baby's heart and lead to congenital heart block.\\n                \\nCongenital heart defects also may cause congenital heart block. These defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. Often, doctors don't know what causes these defects.\\n                \\nAcquired Heart Block\\n                \\nMany factors can cause acquired heart block. Examples include:\\n                \\nDamage to the heart from a heart attack. This is the most common cause of acquired heart block.\\n                \\nCoronary heart disease, also called coronary artery disease.\\n                \\nMyocarditis (MI-o-kar-DI-tis), or inflammation of the heart muscle.\\n                \\nHeart failure.\\n                \\nRheumatic (roo-MAT-ik) fever.\\n                \\nCardiomyopathy (KAR-de-o-mi-OP-a-the), or heart muscle diseases.\\n                \\nOther diseases may increase the risk of heart block. Examples include sarcoidosis (sar-koy-DOE-sis) and the degenerative muscle disorders Lev's disease and Lenegre's disease.\\n                \\nCertain types of surgery also may damage the heart's electrical system and lead to heart block.\\n                \\nExposure to toxic substances and taking certain medicinesincluding digitalis, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockersalso may cause heart block. Doctors closely watch people who are taking these medicines for signs of problems.\\n                \\nSome types of heart block have been linked to genetic mutations (changes in the genes).\\n                \\nAn overly active vagus nerve also can cause heart block. You have one vagus nerve on each side of your body. These nerves run from your brain stem all the way to your abdomen. Activity in the vagus nerve slows the heart rate.\\n                \\nIn some cases, acquired heart block may go away if the factor causing it is treated or resolved. For example, heart block that occurs after a heart attack or surgery may go away during recovery.\\n                \\nAlso, if a medicine is causing heart block, the disorder may go away if the medicine is stopped or the dosage is lowered. Always talk with your doctor before you change the way you take your medicines.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283465.836441}
