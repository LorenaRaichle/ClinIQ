PLEVA is characterized by skin lesions that ulcerate, breakdown, form open sores, then form a red-brown crust. FUMHD often begins as PLEVA, but then rapidly and suddenly progresses to large, destructive ulcers. There may be fever and extensive, painful loss of skin tissue as well as secondary infection of the ulcers. Diagnosis of FUMHD is confirmed by biopsy of skin lesions. FUMHD occurs more frequently in children, peaking at age 5 to 10. Males tend to be affected more often than females. While some cases of FUMHD have resolved without therapy, others have resulted in death. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment may help to reduce morbidity and death.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of febrile ulceronecrotic Mucha-Habermann disease? Initial symptoms of FUMHD include red scaly skin legions (papules) that ulcerate, breakdown, form open sores, then a red-brown crust (i.e., PLEVA).  In FUMHD the legions suddenly progress to large, destructive ulcers and can be associated with extensive, painful loss of skin tissue. The skin lesions can become infected which may cause pus and a putrid odor. The rate of progression from PLEVA to FUMHD varies among reports but may be days to weeks.  Some cases go straight to FUMHD rather than progress from PLEVA. FUMHD is often associated with high fever (up to 104F) that may be persistant or come and go. Other symptoms may include feeling ill, sore throat, congestion, muscle soreness or pain, joint pain, diarrhea, central nervous system symptoms, abdominal pain, enlarged spleen, arthritis, megaloblastic anemia, interstitial pneumonitis (scarring or thickening of the lungs), lymphocytic (viral) myocarditis, and sepsis. FUMHD can become life threatening.', 'What causes febrile ulceronecrotic Mucha-Habermann disease? The cause of FUMHD is not known (idiopathic). A hypersensitivity to an infectious agent is suggested to be the main cause. Single cases of people with FUMHD and Epstein-Barr virus infection, adenovirus, or cytomegalovirus have been reported, but there has been no consistent finding so far. There is some suggestion that FUMHD may be a type of clonal T-cell disorder. Clonal means that all the T-cells were derived from the same cell. T cells are a type of white blood cell (lymphocytes). They make up part of the immune system. T cells help the body fight diseases or harmful substances.', 'How is febrile ulceronecrotic Mucha-Habermann disease definitively diagnosed? FUMHD is diagnosed based upon the clinical symptoms in the patient, with confirmation by skin biopsy. Skin biopsy findings suggestive of FUMHD are outlined below. Because this information is technical we recommend that you review it with a health care provider:  Epidermis - Findings include focal confluent parakeratosis, spongiosis, dyskeratosis, mild to moderate acanthosis, vacuolization of basal layer with necrotic keratino-cytes, occasional intraepidermal vesicles, extensive epidermal necrosis. In advanced disease findings may also include extension of infiltrate into epidermis, invasion of erythrocytes, widespread epidermal necrosis, and nuclear debris in necrotic areas Dermis  Swelling, moderately dense lymphohistiocytic perivascular inflammatory infiltrate usually without atypia, extravasation of lymphocytes and erythrocytes with epidermal invasion, subepidermal vesicles in later lesions, dermal sclerosis in older lesions Vascular changes  Dilation and engorgement of blood vessels in papillary dermis with endothelial proliferation, vascular congestion, occlusion, dermal hemorrhage, and extravasation of erythrocytes Vasculitis  Fibronoid necrosis of vessel walls with leukocytoclassic vasculitis In the majority of patients, blood tests indicate leukocytosis, anemia, elevated C-reactive protein, and elevated liver enzymes. An association of FUMHD with elevated blood levels of TNF-alpha has also been described.']}"}, "time": 1746283459.134919}
