However, solid data on marijuanas health benefits is lacking, and for smoked marijuana many health experts have concerns about the potential negative effects on the lungs and respiratory system. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved smoked marijuana to treat any disease. They have approved two medications that are chemically similar to marijuana to treat wasting disease (extreme weight loss) in people with AIDS and to treat nausea and vomiting associated with cancer treatment.', 'Not always. Some warning signs, such as sleep problems, falls, mood swings, anxiety, depression, and memory problems -- can also be signs of other health conditions.

A doctor, substance abuse counselor, or other health professional can determine the right treatment for an individual. Treatment helps people reduce the powerful effects of drugs on the body and brain. In doing so, treatment helps people improve their physical health and everyday functioning and regain control of their lives. Once in treatment, older adults do just as well or better than younger adults.']}"}, "time": 1746283468.555659}
