There is usually some pain with surgery. There may also be swelling and soreness around the area that the surgeon cut. Your surgeon can tell you which side effects to expect.    There can also be complications. These are unplanned events linked to the operation. Some complications are infection, too much bleeding, reaction to anesthesia, or accidental injury. Some people have a greater risk of complications because of other medical conditions.    Your surgeon can tell you how you might feel and what you will be able to do - or not do - the first few days, weeks, or months after surgery. Some other questions to ask are       - How long you will be in the hospital    - What kind of supplies, equipment, and help you might need when you go home    - When you can go back to work    - When it is ok to start exercising again    - Are they any other restrictions in your activities       Following your surgeon's advice can help you recover as soon as possible.    Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research\", 'The anus is where stool leaves your body when you go to the bathroom. It is made up of your outer layers of skin and the end of your large intestine. Anal cancer is a disease in which cancer cells form in the tissues of the anus.    Anal cancer is rare. It is more common in smokers and people over 50. You are also at higher risk if you have HPV, have anal sex, or have many sexual partners.    Symptoms include bleeding, pain, or lumps in the anal area. Anal itching and discharge can also be signs of anal cancer.    Doctors use tests that examine the anus to diagnose anal cancer. They include a physical exam, endoscopy, ultrasound, and biopsy.    Treatments include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and surgery.    NIH: National Cancer Institute', 'Summary : Puberty is the time in life when a boy or girl becomes sexually mature. It is a process that usually happens between ages 10 and 14 for girls and ages 12 and 16 for boys. It causes physical changes, and affects boys and girls differently.    In girls:       - The first sign of puberty is usually breast development.    - Then hair grows in the pubic area and armpits.    - Menstruation (or a period) usually happens last.       In boys:       - Puberty usually begins with the testicles and penis getting bigger.    - Then hair grows in the pubic area and armpits.    - Muscles grow, the voice deepens, and facial hair develops as puberty continues.       Both boys and girls may get acne. They also usually have a growth spurt (a rapid increase in height) that lasts for about 2 or 3 years. This brings them closer to their adult height, which they reach after puberty.     NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', \"Premature ovarian failure (POF) is when a woman's ovaries stop working before she is 40.    POF is different from premature menopause. With premature menopause, your periods stop before age 40. You can no longer get pregnant. The cause can be natural or it can be a disease, surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. With POF, some women still have occasional periods. They may even get pregnant. In most cases of POF, the cause is unknown.    Missed periods are usually the first sign of POF. Later symptoms may be similar to those of natural menopause:       - Hot flashes    - Night sweats    - Irritability    - Poor concentration    - Decreased sex drive    - Pain during sex    - Vaginal dryness       Doctors diagnose POF by doing a physical exam and lab and imaging tests.    Most women with POF cannot get pregnant naturally. Fertility treatments help a few women; others use donor eggs to have children. There is no treatment that will restore normal ovarian function. However, many health care providers suggest taking hormones until age 50.     NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development\"]}"}, "time": 1746283467.802975}
