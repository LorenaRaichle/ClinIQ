Huntington disease (HD) is a progressive disorder that causes motor, cognitive, and psychiatric signs and symptoms. On average, most people begin developing features of HD between ages 35 and 44. Signs and symptoms vary by stage and may include: Early stage: Behavioral disturbances Clumsiness Moodiness Irritability Paranoia Apathy Anxiety Hallucinations Abnormal eye movements Depression Impaired ability to detect odors Middle stage: Dystonia Involuntary movements Trouble with balance and walking Chorea with twisting and writhing motions Unsteady gait (style of walking) Slow reaction time General weakness Weight loss Speech difficulties Stubbornness Late stage: Rigidity (continual tension of the muscles) Bradykinesia (difficulty initiating and continuing movements) Severe chorea Serious weight loss Inability to speak Inability to walk Swallowing problems Inability to care for oneself There is also a less common, early-onset form of HD which begins in childhood or adolescence. For more information on this form, please visit GARD's juvenile Huntington disease Web page. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Huntington disease. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of movement 50% Abnormality of the voice 50% Behavioral abnormality 50% Cerebral cortical atrophy 50% Developmental regression 50% EEG abnormality 50% Hypertonia 50% Rigidity 7.5% Abnormality of eye movement - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Bradykinesia - Chorea - Dementia - Depression - Gliosis - Hyperreflexia - Neuronal loss in central nervous system - Personality changes - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.\", 'What causes Huntington disease? Huntington disease (HD) is caused by a change (mutation) in the HTT gene. This gene gives instructions for making a protein called huntingtin. The exact function of this protein is unclear, but it appears to be important to nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. The HTT gene mutation that causes HD involves a DNA segment known as a CAG trinucleotide repeat. This segment is made up of three DNA building blocks that repeat multiple times in a row. The CAG segment in a normal HTT gene repeats about 10 to 35 times. In people with HD, it may repeat from 36 to over 120 times. People with 36 to 39 CAG repeats (an intermediate size) may or may not develop HD, while people with 40 or more repeats almost always develop HD. An increased number of CAG repeats leads to an abnormally long version of the huntingtin protein. The long protein is then cut into smaller, toxic pieces that end up sticking together and accumulating in neurons. This disrupts the function of the neurons, ultimately causing the features of HD.', 'How is Huntington disease inherited? Huntington disease (HD) is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that having a change (mutation) in only one of the 2 copies of the HTT gene is enough to cause the condition. When a person with HD has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit the mutated gene and develop the condition. Most people with HD have an affected parent. The family history can sometimes appear negative for various reasons even though a parent carries, or carried, a mutation in the HTT gene. In rare cases, HD is caused by a new (de novo) mutation in the HTT gene, in which case the disease occurs for the first time in the affected person and is not inherited from a parent. As HD is passed through generations, the size of the mutation in the HTT gene (called a trinucleotide repeat) often increases. A longer repeat in the HTT gene may cause earlier onset of symptoms. This phenomenon is called anticipation.', 'Is genetic testing available for Huntington disease? Yes. Testing of adults at risk for Huntington disease (HD) who have no symptoms of the disease is called predictive testing. Whether to have predictive testing requires careful thought, including pre-test and post-test genetic counseling. This is particularly important because there is currently no cure. Furthermore, predictive testing cannot accurately predict the age a person with an HD mutation will develop symptoms, the severity or type of symptoms they will experience, or the future rate of disease progression. A person may want to have predictive testing because they feel they need to know, or to make personal decisions involving having children, finances, and/or career planning. Other people decide they do not want to know whether they will develop HD. Testing is appropriate to consider in symptomatic people of any age in a family with a confirmed diagnosis of HD. However, testing of asymptomatic people younger than age 18 is not considered appropriate. A main reason is that it takes away the choice of whether the person wants to know, while there is no major benefit to knowing at that age. People who are interested in learning more about genetic testing for HD should speak with a genetics professional. How is Huntington disease diagnosed? A diagnosis of Huntington disease is typically suspected in people with characteristic signs and symptoms of the condition and a family history consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance. The diagnosis can then be confirmed with genetic testing that identifies a specific type of change (mutation) in the HTT gene.']}"}, "time": 1746283454.6478431}
