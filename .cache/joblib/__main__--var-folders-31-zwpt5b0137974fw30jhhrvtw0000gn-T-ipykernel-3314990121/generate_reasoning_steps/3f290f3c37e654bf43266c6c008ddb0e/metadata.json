The disorder also may cause muscle weakness.\\n                \\nMost people who have narcolepsy have trouble sleeping at night. Some people who have the disorder fall asleep suddenly, even if they\\'re in the middle of talking, eating, or another activity.\\n                \\nNarcolepsy also can cause:\\n                \\nCataplexy (KAT-ah-plek-se). This condition causes a sudden loss of muscle tone while you\\'re awake. Muscle weakness can affect certain parts of your body or your whole body. For example, if cataplexy affects your hand, you may drop what you\\'re holding. Strong emotions often trigger this weakness. It may last seconds or minutes.\\n                \\nHallucinations (ha-lu-sih-NA-shuns). These vivid dreams occur while falling asleep or waking up.\\n                \\nSleep paralysis (pah-RAL-ih-sis). This condition prevents you from moving or speaking while waking up and sometimes while falling asleep. Sleep paralysis usually goes away within a few minutes.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nThe two main phases of sleep are nonrapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM). Most people are in the NREM phase when they first fall asleep. After about 90 minutes of sleep, most people go from NREM to REM sleep.\\n                \\nDreaming occurs during the REM phase of sleep. During REM, your muscles normally become limp. This prevents you from acting out your dreams. (For more information about sleep cycles, go to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\'s \"Your Guide to Healthy Sleep.\")\\n                \\nPeople who have narcolepsy often fall into REM sleep quickly and wake up directly from it. As a result, they may have vivid dreams while falling asleep and waking up.\\n                \\nHypocretin (hi-po-KREET-in), a chemical in the brain, helps promote wakefulness. Most people who have narcolepsy have low levels of this chemical. What causes these low levels isn\\'t well understood.\\n                \\nResearchers think that certain factors may work together to cause a lack of hypocretin. These factors may include heredity, infections, brain injuries, and autoimmune disorders. (Autoimmune disorders occur if the body\\'s immune system mistakenly attacks the body\\'s cells and tissues.)\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nNarcolepsy symptoms usually begin during the teen or young adult years. People who have narcolepsy may find it hard to function at school, work, home, and in social situations because of extreme tiredness.\\n                \\nNarcolepsy has no cure, but medicines, lifestyle changes, and other therapies can improve symptoms. Research is ongoing on the causes of narcolepsy and new ways to treat it.', \"Most people who have narcolepsy have low levels of hypocretin. This is a chemical in the brain that helps promote wakefulness. What causes low hypocretin levels isn't well understood.\\n                \\nResearchers think that certain factors may work together to cause a lack of hypocretin. These factors may include:\\n                \\nHeredity. Some people may inherit a gene that affects hypocretin. Up to 10 percent of people who have narcolepsy report having a relative who has the same symptoms.\\n                \\nInfections.\\n                \\nBrain injuries caused by conditions such as brain tumors, strokes, or trauma (for example, car accidents or military-related wounds).\\n                \\nAutoimmune disorders. With these disorders, the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the body's cells and tissues. An example of an autoimmune disorder is rheumatoid arthritis.\\n                \\nLow levels of histamine, a substance in the blood that promotes wakefulness.\\n                \\nSome research suggests that environmental toxins may play a role in triggering narcolepsy. Toxins may include heavy metals, pesticides and weed killers, and secondhand smoke.\\n                \\nHeredity alone doesn't cause narcolepsy. You also must have at least one other factor, such as one of those listed above, to develop narcolepsy.\", 'Narcolepsy affects men and women. Symptoms usually begin during the teen or young adult years. The disorder also can develop later in life or in children, but it\\'s rare before age 5.\\n                \\nResearchers think that certain factors may work together to cause narcolepsy. If these factors affect you, you may be at higher risk for the disorder. (For more information, go to \"What Causes Narcolepsy?\")', 'The four major signs and symptoms of narcolepsy are extreme daytime sleepiness, cataplexy (muscle weakness) while awake, and hallucinations and sleep paralysis during sleep.\\n                \\nIf you have narcolepsy, you may have one or more of these symptoms. They can range from mild to severe. Less than one-third of people who have narcolepsy have all four symptoms.\\n                \\nExtreme Daytime Sleepiness\\n                \\nAll people who have narcolepsy have extreme daytime sleepiness. This often is the most obvious symptom of the disorder.\\n                \\nDuring the day, you may have few or many periods of sleepiness. Each period usually lasts 30minutes or less. Strong emotionssuch as anger, fear, laughter, or excitementcan trigger this sleepiness.\\n                \\nPeople who have daytime sleepiness often complain of:\\n                \\nMental cloudiness or \"fog\"\\n                \\nMemory problems or problems focusing\\n                \\nLack of energy or extreme exhaustion\\n                \\nDepression\\n                \\nSome people who have narcolepsy have episodes in which they fall asleep suddenly. This is more likely to happen when they\\'re not activefor example, while reading, watching TV, or sitting in a meeting.\\n                \\nHowever, sleep episodes also may occur in the middle of talking, eating, or another activity. Cataplexy also may occur at the same time.\\n                \\nCataplexy\\n                \\nThis condition causes loss of muscle tone while you\\'re awake. Muscle weakness affects part or all of your body.\\n                \\nCataplexy may make your head nod or make it hard for you to speak. Muscle weakness also may make your knees weak or cause you to drop things you\\'re holding. Some people lose all muscle control and fall.\\n                \\nStrong emotionssuch as anger, surprise, fear, or laughteroften trigger cataplexy. It usually lasts a few seconds or minutes. During this time, you\\'re usually awake.\\n                \\nCataplexy may occur weeks to years after you first start to have extreme daytime sleepiness.\\n                \\nHallucinations\\n                \\nIf you have narcolepsy, you may have vivid dreams while falling asleep, waking up, or dozing. These dreams can feel very real. You may feel like you can see, hear, smell, and taste things.\\n                \\nSleep Paralysis\\n                \\nThis condition prevents you from moving or speaking while falling asleep or waking up. However, you\\'re fully conscious (aware) during this time. Sleep paralysis usually lasts just a few seconds or minutes, but it can be scary.\\n                \\nOther Symptoms\\n                \\nMost people who have narcolepsy don\\'t sleep well at night. They may have trouble falling and staying asleep. Vivid, scary dreams may disturb sleep. Not sleeping well at night worsens daytime sleepiness.\\n                \\nRarely, people who fall asleep in the middle of an activity, such as eating, may continue that activity for a few seconds or minutes. This is called automatic behavior.\\n                \\nDuring automatic behavior, you\\'re not aware of your actions, so you don\\'t do them well. For example, if you\\'re writing before falling asleep, you may scribble rather than form words. If you\\'re driving, you may get lost or have an accident. Most people who have this symptom don\\'t remember what happened while it was going on.\\n                \\nChildren who have narcolepsy often have trouble studying, focusing, and remembering things. Also, they may seem hyperactive. Some children who have narcolepsy speed up their activities rather than slow them down.\\n                \\nChildren who have narcolepsy may have severe sleepiness. They may fall asleep while talking or eating, or during sporting events and social activities.']}"}, "time": 1746283466.217414}
