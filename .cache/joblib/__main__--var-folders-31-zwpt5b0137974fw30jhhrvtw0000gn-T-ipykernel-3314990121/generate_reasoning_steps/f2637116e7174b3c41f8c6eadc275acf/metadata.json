CDA types I and II are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the associated gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.  In several families, CDA type III appears to have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Autosomal dominant inheritance means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In these families, affected individuals often have a parent and other relatives with the condition.', 'These resources address the diagnosis or management of CDA:  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia Type I  - Genetic Testing Registry: Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia, type I  - Genetic Testing Registry: Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia, type II  - Genetic Testing Registry: Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia, type III  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Ham Test  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Hepatomegaly  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Jaundice  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Splenomegaly   These resources from MedlinePlus offer information about the diagnosis and management of various health conditions:  - Diagnostic Tests  - Drug Therapy  - Surgery and Rehabilitation  - Genetic Counseling   - Palliative Care', 'Langer-Giedion syndrome is a condition that causes bone abnormalities and distinctive facial features. People with this condition have multiple noncancerous (benign) bone tumors called osteochondromas. Multiple osteochondromas may result in pain, limited range of joint movement, and pressure on nerves, blood vessels, the spinal cord, and tissues surrounding the osteochondromas. Affected individuals also have short stature and cone-shaped ends of the long bones (epiphyses). The characteristic appearance of individuals with Langer-Giedion syndrome includes sparse scalp hair, a rounded nose, a long flat area between the nose and the upper lip (philtrum), and a thin upper lip. Some people with this condition have loose skin in childhood, which typically resolves with age. Affected individuals may have some intellectual disability.', 'Langer-Giedion syndrome is a rare condition; its incidence is unknown.']}"}, "time": 1746283452.874181}
