The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Chromosome 8p23.1 deletion. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Cognitive impairment 90% Intrauterine growth retardation 90% Abnormality of the nose 50% Abnormality of the palate 50% Abnormality of the pulmonary artery 50% Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 50% Complete atrioventricular canal defect 50% Cryptorchidism 50% Displacement of the external urethral meatus 50% Epicanthus 50% External ear malformation 50% High forehead 50% Microcephaly 50% Narrow forehead 50% Neurological speech impairment 50% Seizures 50% Short neck 50% Short stature 50% Weight loss 50% Abnormality of the aorta 7.5% Abnormality of thumb phalanx 7.5% Congenital diaphragmatic hernia 7.5% Deeply set eye 7.5% Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 7.5% Hypoplastic left heart 7.5% Obesity 7.5% Patent ductus arteriosus 7.5% Preaxial foot polydactyly 7.5% Proximal placement of thumb 7.5% Tetralogy of Fallot 7.5% Transposition of the great arteries 7.5% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection is a rare condition in which the body makes too many lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. Lymphocytes are an important part of the immune system because they help fight off diseases and protect the body from infection. About 95% of adults are infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Most infections occur during childhood and do not cause any symptoms. EBV infection in adolescents or young adults can often result in infectious mononucleosis.  Rarely, people infected with EBV develop a life-threatening condition called chronic active EBV virus (CAEBV). Patients with CAEBV most often have fever, liver dysfunction, an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly), swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), and low numbers of platelets (thrombocytopenia). Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has shown promise in the treatment of CAEBV.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection?

In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) refers to a group of genetic conditions that affect the adrenal glands. These glands sit on top of the kidneys and are responsible for releasing various types of hormones that the body needs to function. Affected people lack an enzyme the adrenal glands need to make one or more of these hormones and often overproduce androgens (male hormones such as testosterone). The signs and symptoms present in each person depend on many factors including the type of CAH, the age of diagnosis, and the sex of the affected person. For example, females with a severe form of the condition may have ambiguous genitalia at birth and if not properly diagnosed, develop dehydration, poor feeding, diarrhea, vomiting and other health problems soon after. People with milder forms may not be diagnosed with the condition until adolescence or adulthood when they experience early signs of puberty or fertility problems. Treatment for CAH varies but may include medication and/or surgery.']}"}, "time": 1746283460.8339462}
