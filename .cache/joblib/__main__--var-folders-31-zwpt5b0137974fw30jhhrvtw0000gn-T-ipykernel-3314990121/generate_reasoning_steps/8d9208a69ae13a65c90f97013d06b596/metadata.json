Early signs and symptoms of the condition include fever, chills, muscle pain, headache, and joint pain. As the condition progresses, affected people may experience heart problems, Bell's palsy, arthritis, abnormal muscle movement, speech problems and cognitive (thinking) abnormalities. Please visit the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Web site for a more comprehensive list of symptoms. Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected blacklegged ticks. Certain features of the condition, including whether or not an affected person will develop medication-resistant chronic arthritis, is thought to be influenced by genetic factors (certain human leukocyte antigen genes). Treatment generally includes antibiotics to address the bacterial infection and other medications (i.e. pain medications) to relieve symptoms.\", 'What are the signs and symptoms of Lyme disease? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Lyme disease. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Hypermelanotic macule 90% Arthritis 50% Cranial nerve paralysis 50% Joint swelling 50% Meningitis 50% Abnormality of temperature regulation 7.5% Amaurosis fugax 7.5% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the skin 7.5% Arrhythmia 7.5% Arthralgia 7.5% Encephalitis 7.5% Inflammatory abnormality of the eye 7.5% Insomnia 7.5% Memory impairment 7.5% Migraine 7.5% Muscle weakness 7.5% Myalgia 7.5% Nausea and vomiting 7.5% Paresthesia 7.5% Photophobia 7.5% Skin rash 7.5% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Char syndrome is a condition that affects the development of the face, heart, and limbs. It is characterized by a combination of three major features: a distinctive facial appearance, a heart defect called patent ductus arteriosus, and hand abnormalities. Char syndrome is caused by mutations in the TFAP2B gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Char syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Char syndrome.
