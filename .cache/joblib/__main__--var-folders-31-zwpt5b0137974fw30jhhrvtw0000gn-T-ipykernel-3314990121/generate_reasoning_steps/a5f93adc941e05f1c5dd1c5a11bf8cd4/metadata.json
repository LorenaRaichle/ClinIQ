They are located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. Every day, the kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine.\\n                \\nHealthy kidneys produce a hormone called erythropoietin (EPO). A hormone is a chemical produced by the body and released into the blood to help trigger or regulate particular body functions. EPO prompts the bone marrow to make red blood cells, which then carry oxygen throughout the body.', 'When kidneys are diseased or damaged, they do not make enough EPO. As a result, the bone marrow makes fewer red blood cells, causing anemia. When blood has fewer red blood cells, it deprives the body of the oxygen it needs.\\n                \\nOther common causes of anemia in people with kidney disease include blood loss from hemodialysis and low levels of the following nutrients found in food:\\n                \\n- iron  - vitamin B12  - folic acid\\n                \\nThese nutrients are necessary for red blood cells to make hemoglobin, the main oxygen-carrying protein in the red blood cells.\\n                \\nIf treatments for kidney-related anemia do not help, the health care provider will look for other causes of anemia, including\\n                \\n- other problems with bone marrow  - inflammatory problemssuch as arthritis, lupus, or inflammatory bowel diseasein which the bodys immune system attacks the bodys own cells and organs  - chronic infections such as diabetic ulcers  - malnutrition', 'The signs and symptoms of anemia in someone with CKD may include\\n                \\n- weakness  - fatigue, or feeling tired  - headaches  - problems with concentration  - paleness  - dizziness  - difficulty breathing or shortness of breath  - chest pain\\n                \\nAnyone having difficulty breathing or with shortness of breath should seek immediate medical care. Anyone who has chest pain should call 911.', 'Heart problems are a complication of anemia and may include\\n                \\n- an irregular heartbeat or an unusually fast heartbeat, especially when exercising.  - the harmful enlargement of muscles in the heart.  - heart failure, which does not mean the heart suddenly stops working. Instead, heart failure is a long-lasting condition in which the heart cant pump enough blood to meet the bodys needs.']}"}, "time": 1746283484.8380108}
