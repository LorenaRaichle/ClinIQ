The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Pseudoaminopterin syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal facial shape - Arachnodactyly - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Brachycephaly - Brachydactyly syndrome - Cleft palate - Clinodactyly - Cryptorchidism - Decreased body weight - Frontal bossing - Frontal upsweep of hair - High palate - Highly arched eyebrow - Hypertelorism - Inguinal hernia - Intrauterine growth retardation - Joint contracture of the hand - Low-set ears - Macrocephaly - Megalencephaly - Microcephaly - Muscular hypotonia - Narrow forehead - Oligodontia - Phenotypic variability - Posteriorly rotated ears - Rudimentary postaxial polydactyly of hands - Short stature - Short thumb - Small palpebral fissure - Syndactyly - Thoracic scoliosis - Umbilical hernia - Underdeveloped supraorbital ridges - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a form of severe epilepsy that begins in childhood. It is characterized by multiple types of seizures and intellectual disability. This condition can be caused by brain malformations, perinatal asphyxia (lack of oxygen), severe head injury, central nervous system infection and inherited degenerative or metabolic conditions. In about one-third of cases, no cause can be found. Treatment for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome includes anti-epileptic medications such as valproate, lamotrigine, felbamate, or topiramate. There is usually no single antiepileptic medication that will control seizures. Children may improve initially, but many later show tolerance to a drug or develop uncontrollable seizures.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome?
