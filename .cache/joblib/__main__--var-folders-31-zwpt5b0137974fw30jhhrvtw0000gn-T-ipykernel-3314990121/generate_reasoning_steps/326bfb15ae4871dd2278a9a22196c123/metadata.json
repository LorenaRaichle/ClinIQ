Although the number of new cases of testicular cancer has doubled in the last 40 years, the number of deaths caused by testicular cancer has decreased greatly because of better treatments. Testicular cancer can usually be cured, even in late stages of the disease. (See the PDQ summary on Testicular Cancer Treatment for more information.)', \"A condition called cryptorchidism (an undescended testicle) is a risk factor for testicular cancer. Anything that increases the chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk to your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for testicular cancer include the following:          - Having cryptorchidism (an undescended testicle).    - Having a testicle that is not normal, such as a small testicle that does not work the way it should.    - Having testicular carcinoma in situ.    - Being white.    - Having a personal or family history of testicular cancer.    - Having Klinefelter syndrome.        Men who have cryptorchidism, a testicle that is not normal, or testicular carcinoma in situ have an increased risk of testicular cancer in one or both testicles, and need to be followed closely.\", 'Key Points\\n                    - Adult primary liver cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the liver.    - There are two types of adult primary liver cancer.    - Having hepatitis or cirrhosis can affect the risk of adult primary liver cancer.     - Signs and symptoms of adult primary liver cancer include a lump or pain on the right side.     - Tests that examine the liver and the blood are used to detect (find) and diagnose adult primary liver cancer.    - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Adult primary liver cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the liver.\\n                    The liver is one of the largest organs in the body. It has four lobes and fills the upper right side of the abdomen inside the rib cage. Three of the many important functions of the liver are:         - To filter harmful substances from the blood so they can be passed from the body in stools and urine.    - To make bile to help digest fat that comes from food.     - To store glycogen (sugar), which the body uses for energy.\\n                \\n                \\n                    There are two types of adult primary liver cancer.\\n                    The two types of adult primary liver cancer are:         -  Hepatocellular carcinoma.    -  Cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer). (See the PDQ summary on Bile Duct Cancer Treatment for more information.)        The most common type of adult primary liver cancer is hepatocellular carcinoma. This type of liver cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.   This summary is about the treatment of primary liver cancer (cancer that begins in the liver). Treatment of cancer that begins in other parts of the body and spreads to the liver is not covered in this summary.    Primary liver cancer can occur in both adults and children. However, treatment for children is different than treatment for adults. (See the PDQ summary on Childhood Liver Cancer Treatment for more information.)', 'Having hepatitis or cirrhosis can affect the risk of adult primary liver cancer. Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk.    The following are risk factors for adult primary liver cancer:         - Having hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Having both hepatitis B and hepatitis C increases the risk even more.    -  Having cirrhosis, which can be caused by:               -  hepatitis (especially hepatitis C); or       - drinking large amounts of alcohol for many years or being an alcoholic.              - Having metabolic syndrome, a set of conditions that occur together, including extra fat around the abdomen, high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high levels of triglycerides and low levels of high-density lipoproteins in the blood.     - Having liver injury that is long-lasting, especially if it leads to cirrhosis.    - Having hemochromatosis, a condition in which the body takes up and stores more iron than it needs. The extra iron is stored in the liver, heart, and pancreas     - Eating foods tainted with aflatoxin (poison from a fungus that can grow on foods, such as grains and nuts, that have not been stored properly).']}"}, "time": 1746283464.837343}
