Patients with this syndrome typically present between the ages of 3 and 13 years with nighttime seizures. The episodes usually begin with twitching and stiffness of the face, and often wake up the child.  The clonic activity causes a tingling feeling on one side of the mouth involving the tongue, lips, gum and inner side of the cheek.  The seizure may also involve the throat which may make speech unclear and difficult to understand.   Occasionally, both sides of the body may be affected, which can lead to loss of consciousness causing stiffness and jerking movements of the arms and legs.  The child may also be incontinent.  After an episode, a child may be sleepy and doze for a few hours. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Benign rolandic epilepsy (BRE). If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Bilateral convulsive seizures - EEG with centrotemporal focal spike waves - Sporadic - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What causes benign rolandic epilepsy? Benign rolandic epilepsy is a genetic syndrome with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance.  Although the gene associated with the condition has not been identified, Neubauer et al. (1998) found evidence of linkage to chromosome 15q. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy has been mapped to the same region.', 'What treatment is available for benign rolandic epilepsy? Although treatment is usually not necessary since the episodes are infrequent and are typically outgrown by puberty, anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine.', '3-Hydroxyisobutyric aciduria is a rare metabolic condition in which the body is unable to breakdown certain amino acids (the building blocks of protein). This leads to a toxic buildup of particular acids known as organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), tissues and urine (organic aciduria). Signs and symptoms of 3-hydroxyisobutyric aciduria include developmental delay, characteristic facial features and brain abnormalities. The exact underlying cause is not well understood; however, researchers believe some cases are caused by changes (mutations) in the ALDH6A1 gene and inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Because it is so rare, there is limited evidence to support the effectiveness of treatment, but a protein-restricted diet and carnitine supplementation have been tried with varying degrees of success.']}"}, "time": 1746283458.1863658}
