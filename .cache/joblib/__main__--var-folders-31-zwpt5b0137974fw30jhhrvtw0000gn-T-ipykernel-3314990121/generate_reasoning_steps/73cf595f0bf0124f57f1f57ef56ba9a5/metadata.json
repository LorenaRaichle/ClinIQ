Affected individuals may have periodic endoscopic and oral cavity evaluations by a gastroentrologist to detect esophageal cancer. For the palmoplantar keratoderma, a dermatologist may recommend oral retinoids such as etretinate, isotretinoin, and acitretin. Topical therapies may include soaking in salt water and then gentle removal of dead tissue (debridement) and 50% propylene glycol in water under plastic dressing overnight weekly.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Ectodermal dysplasia skin fragility syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Ectodermal dysplasia skin fragility syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal blistering of the skin 90% Abnormality of the eyebrow 90% Abnormality of the nail 90% Alopecia 90% Palmoplantar keratoderma 90% Skin ulcer 90% Blepharitis 50% Dry skin 50% Furrowed tongue 50% Malabsorption 50% Pruritus 50% Woolly hair 7.5% Ectodermal dysplasia - Fragile skin - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair is characterized  by facial features suggestive of Noonan syndrome (macrocephaly, high forehead, wide-set eyes or hypertelorism, palpebral ptosis, and low-set and posteriorly rotated ears) along with hair that resembles loose anagen hair syndrome (pluckable, sparse, thin and slow-growing). Other features include frequent congenital heart defects, distinctive skin features (darkly pigmented skin with eczema or ichthyosis), short stature which may be associated with a growth hormone deficiency, and developmental delays. The condition is caused by mutations in the SHOC2 gene. It follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair?
