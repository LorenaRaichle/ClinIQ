It could be normal. Some children may be small for their age but still be developing normally. Some children are short or tall because their parents are.    But some children have growth disorders. Growth disorders are problems that prevent children from developing normal height, weight, sexual maturity or other features.    Very slow or very fast growth can sometimes signal a gland problem or disease.    The pituitary gland makes growth hormone, which stimulates the growth of bone and other tissues. Children who have too little of it may be very short. Treatment with growth hormone can stimulate growth.    People can also have too much growth hormone. Usually the cause is a pituitary gland tumor, which is not cancer. Too much growth hormone can cause gigantism in children, where their bones and their body grow too much. In adults, it can cause acromegaly, which makes the hands, feet and face larger than normal. Possible treatments include surgery to remove the tumor, medicines, and radiation therapy.', 'Summary : Each step you take involves a complex network of bones, muscles, tendons, and ligaments. This, combined with all of the weight they carry, explains why feet can have problems. To keep your feet healthy       -  Examine your feet regularly    -  Wear comfortable shoes that fit    -  Wash your feet daily with soap and lukewarm water     -  Trim your toenails straight across and not too short       Your foot health can be a clue to your overall health. For example, joint stiffness could mean arthritis. Tingling or numbness could be a sign of diabetes. Swelling might indicate kidney disease, heart disease, or high blood pressure.    Good foot care and regular foot checks are an important part of your health care. If you have foot problems, be sure to talk to your doctor.

When there is something wrong with them, it can make life difficult. Common problems include       - Injuries that result in fractures, ruptured ligaments and dislocations    - Osteoarthritis - wear-and-tear arthritis. It can also cause deformity.    - Tendinitis - irritation of the tendons    - Dupuytren's contracture - a hereditary thickening of the tough tissue that lies just below the skin of your palm. It causes the fingers to stiffen and bend.    - Trigger finger - an irritation of the sheath that surrounds the flexor tendons. It can cause the tendon to catch and release like a trigger.\", \"Giardiasis is an illness caused by a parasite called Giardia intestinalis. It lives in soil, food, and water. It may also be on surfaces that have been contaminated with waste. You can become infected if you swallow the parasite. You can also get it if you're exposed to human feces (poop) through sexual contact.    The risk of getting giardia is higher for travelers to countries where it is common, people in child care settings, and those who drink untreated water.    Diarrhea is the main symptom of giardia infection. Others include       -  Passing gas    -  Greasy stools    -  Stomach cramps    -  Upset stomach or nausea        These symptoms may lead to weight loss and loss of body fluids. Some people have no symptoms at all. Symptoms of infection often last two to six weeks. Stool sample tests can diagnose it. You often need to collect several samples to test. Doctors use several drugs to treat it.     The best way to prevent giardia infection is to practice good hygiene, including frequent hand washing. You should not drink water that may be contaminated. You should also peel or wash fresh fruit and vegetables before eating.    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\"]}"}, "time": 1746283466.648648}
