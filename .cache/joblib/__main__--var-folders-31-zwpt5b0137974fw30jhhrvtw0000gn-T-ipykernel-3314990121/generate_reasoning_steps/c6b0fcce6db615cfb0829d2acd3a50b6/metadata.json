The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Papillon Lefevre syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition.

Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the fingernails 90% Gingivitis 90% Palmoplantar keratoderma 90% Periodontitis 90% Premature loss of primary teeth 90% Pustule 90% Reduced number of teeth 90% Cerebral calcification 50% Recurrent respiratory infections 50% Skin ulcer 50% Arachnodactyly 7.5% Hypertrichosis 7.5% Hypopigmented skin patches 7.5% Liver abscess 7.5% Melanoma 7.5% Neoplasm of the skin 7.5% Osteolysis 7.5% Atrophy of alveolar ridges - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Choroid plexus calcification - Palmoplantar hyperkeratosis - Premature loss of teeth - Severe periodontitis - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4B2?

Signs and symptoms of this condition are present from birth and usually include sensorineural hearing loss, fair skin, and light-colored hair. It is caused by changes (mutations) in the MITF gene and inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The goal of treatment is to improve hearing; cochlear implantation may be considered.']}"}, "time": 1746283456.103751}
