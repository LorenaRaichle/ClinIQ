It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.       Hyperfractionated radiation therapy     Hyperfractionated radiation therapy is radiation treatment in which the total dose of radiation is divided into small doses and the treatments are given more than once a day.        Hyperthermia therapy     Hyperthermia therapy is a treatment in which body tissue is heated above normal temperature to damage and kill cancer cells or to make cancer cells more sensitive to the effects of radiation and certain anticancer drugs.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\\n                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\\n                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.\", \"Key Points\\n                    - Laryngeal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the larynx.    - Use of tobacco products and drinking too much alcohol can affect the risk of laryngeal cancer.    - Signs and symptoms of laryngeal cancer include a sore throat and ear pain.     - Tests that examine the throat and neck are used to help detect (find), diagnose, and stage laryngeal cancer.    - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Laryngeal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the larynx.\\n                    The larynx is a part of the throat, between the base of the tongue and the trachea. The larynx contains the vocal cords, which vibrate and make sound when air is directed against them. The sound echoes through the pharynx, mouth, and nose to make a person's voice.   There are three main parts of the larynx:          -  Supraglottis: The upper part of the larynx above the vocal cords, including the epiglottis.    -  Glottis: The middle part of the larynx where the vocal cords are located.    -  Subglottis: The lower part of the larynx between the vocal cords and the trachea (windpipe).         Most laryngeal cancers form in squamous cells, the thin, flat cells lining the inside of the larynx.    Laryngeal cancer is a type of head and neck cancer.\", \"Use of tobacco products and drinking too much alcohol can affect the risk of laryngeal cancer.Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk.\", 'Signs and symptoms of laryngeal cancer include a sore throat and ear pain. These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by laryngeal cancer or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:         - A sore throat or cough that does not go away.    - Trouble or pain when swallowing.    - Ear pain.    - A lump in the neck or throat.    - A change or hoarseness in the voice.']}"}, "time": 1746283464.5341408}
