Specifically, people with this condition are unable to break down a GAG called heparan sulfate. Affected individuals can have severe neurological symptoms, including progressive dementia, aggressive behavior, hyperactivity, seizures, deafness, loss of vision, and an inability to sleep for more than a few hours at a time. MPS IIIB is caused by alterations (mutations) in the NAGLU gene. This gene provides the instructions for producing an enzyme called N-alpha-acetylglucosaminidase, which is needed to completely break down heparan sulfate. MPS IIIB is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. There is no specific treatment for this condition. Most people with MPS IIIB live into their teenage years, and some live longer.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Aggressive behavior - Asymmetric septal hypertrophy - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Cardiomegaly - Coarse facial features - Coarse hair - Dense calvaria - Diarrhea - Dysostosis multiplex - Hearing impairment - Heparan sulfate excretion in urine - Hepatomegaly - Hirsutism - Hyperactivity - Intellectual disability - Joint stiffness - Juvenile onset - Ovoid thoracolumbar vertebrae - Progressive neurologic deterioration - Recurrent upper respiratory tract infections - Seizures - Sleep disturbance - Splenomegaly - Synophrys - Thickened ribs - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Lipoid proteinosis (LP) of Urbach and Wiethe is a rare condition that affects the skin and the brain. The signs and symptoms of this condition and the disease severity vary from person to person. The first sign of LP is usually a hoarse cry during infancy. Affected children then develop characteristic growths on the skin and mucus membranes in the first two years of life. Damage to the temporal lobes (the portions of the brain that process emotions and are important for short-term memory) occurs over time and can lead to seizures and intellectual disability. Other signs and symptoms may include hair loss, oligodontia, speech problems, frequent upper respiratory infections, difficulty swallowing, dystonia, and learning disabilities. LP is caused by changes (mutations) in the ECM1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. There is currently no cure for LP and treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Lipoid proteinosis of Urbach and Wiethe?
