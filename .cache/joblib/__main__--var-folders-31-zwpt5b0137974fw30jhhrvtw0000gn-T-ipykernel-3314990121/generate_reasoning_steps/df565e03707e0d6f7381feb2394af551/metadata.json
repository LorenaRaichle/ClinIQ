The genetic test shows whether a newborn has faulty CFTR genes. The blood test shows whether a newborn's pancreas is working properly.\\n                \\nSweat Test\\n                \\nIf a genetic test or blood test suggests CF, a doctor will confirm the diagnosis using a sweat test. This test is the most useful test for diagnosing CF. A sweat test measures the amount of salt in sweat.\\n                \\nFor this test, the doctor triggers sweating on a small patch of skin on an arm or leg. He or she rubs the skin with a sweat-producing chemical and then uses an electrode to provide a mild electrical current. This may cause a tingling or warm feeling.\\n                \\nSweat is collected on a pad or paper and then analyzed. The sweat test usually is done twice. High salt levels confirm a diagnosis of CF.\\n                \\nOther Tests\\n                \\nIf you or your child has CF, your doctor may recommend other tests, such as:\\n                \\nGenetic tests to find out what type of CFTR defect is causing your CF.\\n                \\nA chest x ray. This test creates pictures of the structures in your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. A chest x ray can show whether your lungs are inflamed or scarred, or whether they trap air.\\n                \\nA sinus x ray. This test may show signs of sinusitis, a complication of CF.\\n                \\nLung function tests. These tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood.\\n                \\nA sputum culture. For this test, your doctor will take a sample of your sputum (spit) to see whether bacteria are growing in it. If you have bacteria called mucoid Pseudomonas, you may have more advanced CF that needs aggressive treatment.\\n                \\nPrenatal Screening\\n                \\nIf you're pregnant, prenatal genetic tests can show whether your fetus has CF. These tests include amniocentesis (AM-ne-o-sen-TE-sis) and chorionic villus (ko-re-ON-ik VIL-us) sampling (CVS).\\n                \\nIn amniocentesis, your doctor inserts a hollow needle through your abdominal wall into your uterus. He or she removes a small amount of fluid from the sac around the baby. The fluid is tested to see whether both of the baby's CFTR genes are normal.\\n                \\nIn CVS, your doctor threads a thin tube through the vagina and cervix to the placenta. The doctor removes a tissue sample from the placenta using gentle suction. The sample is tested to see whether the baby has CF.\\n                \\nCystic Fibrosis Carrier Testing\\n                \\nPeople who have one normal CFTR gene and one faulty CFTR gene are CF carriers. CF carriers usually have no symptoms of CF and live normal lives. However, carriers can pass faulty CFTR genes on to their children.\\n                \\nIf you have a family history of CF or a partner who has CF (or a family history of it) and you're planning a pregnancy, you may want to find out whether you're a CF carrier.\\n                \\nA genetics counselor can test a blood or saliva sample to find out whether you have a faulty CF gene. This type of testing can detect faulty CF genes in 9 out of 10 cases.\", \"Cystic fibrosis (CF) has no cure. However, treatments have greatly improved in recent years. The goals of CF treatment include:\\n                \\nPreventing and controlling lung infections\\n                \\nLoosening and removing thick, sticky mucus from the lungs\\n                \\nPreventing or treating blockages in the intestines\\n                \\nProviding enough nutrition\\n                \\nPreventing dehydration (a lack of fluid in the body)\\n                \\nDepending on the severity of CF, you or your child may be treated in a hospital.\\n                \\nSpecialists Involved\\n                \\nIf you or your child has CF, you may be treated by a CF specialist. This is a doctor who is familiar with the complex nature of CF.\\n                \\nOften, a CF specialist works with a medical team of nurses, physical therapists, dietitians, and social workers. CF specialists often are located at major medical centers.\\n                \\nThe United States also has more than 100 CF Care Centers. These centers have teams of doctors, nurses, dietitians, respiratory therapists, physical therapists, and social workers who have special training related to CF care. Most CF Care Centers have pediatric and adult programs or clinics.\\n                \\nFor more information about CF Care Centers, go to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's Care Center Network Web page.\\n                \\nTreatment for Lung Problems\\n                \\nThe main treatments for lung problems in people who have CF are chest physical therapy (CPT), exercise, and medicines. Your doctor also may recommend a pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program.\\n                \\nChest Physical Therapy\\n                \\nCPT also is called chest clapping or percussion. It involves pounding your chest and back over and over with your hands or a device to loosen the mucus from your lungs so that you can cough it up.\\n                \\nYou might sit down or lie on your stomach with your head down while you do CPT. Gravity and force help drain the mucus from your lungs.\\n                \\nSome people find CPT hard or uncomfortable to do. Several devices have been developed that may help with CPT, such as:\\n                \\nAn electric chest clapper, known as a mechanical percussor.\\n                \\nAn inflatable therapy vest that uses high-frequency airwaves to force the mucus that's deep in your lungs toward your upper airways so you can cough it up.\\n                \\nA small, handheld device that you exhale through. The device causes vibrations that dislodge the mucus.\\n                \\nA mask that creates vibrations that help break the mucus loose from your airway walls.\\n                \\nBreathing techniques also may help dislodge mucus so you can cough it up. These techniques include forcing out a couple of short breaths or deeper breaths and then doing relaxed breathing. This may help loosen the mucus in your lungs and open your airways.\\n                \\nExercise\\n                \\nAerobic exercise that makes you breathe harder can help loosen the mucus in your airways so you can cough it up. Exercise also helps improve your overall physical condition.\\n                \\nHowever, CF causes your sweat to become very salty. As a result, your body loses large amounts of salt when you sweat. Thus, your doctor may recommend a high-salt diet or salt supplements to maintain the balance of minerals in your blood.\\n                \\nIf you exercise regularly, you may be able to cut back on your CPT. However, you should check with your doctor first.\\n                \\nMedicines\\n                \\nIf you have CF, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medicines, bronchodilators, or medicines to help clear the mucus. These medicines help treat or prevent lung infections, reduce swelling and open up the airways, and thin mucus. If you have mutations in a gene called G551D, which occurs in about 5 percent of people who have CF, your doctor may prescribe the oral medicine ivacaftor (approved for people with CF who are 6 years of age and older).\\n                \\nAntibiotics are the main treatment to prevent or treat lung infections. Your doctor may prescribe oral, inhaled, or intravenous (IV) antibiotics.\\n                \\nOral antibiotics often are used to treat mild lung infections. Inhaled antibiotics may be used to prevent or control infections caused by the bacteria mucoid Pseudomonas. For severe or hard-to-treat infections, you may be given antibiotics through an IV tube (a tube inserted into a vein). This type of treatment may require you to stay in a hospital.\\n                \\nAnti-inflammatory medicines can help reduce swelling in your airways due to ongoing infections. These medicines may be inhaled or oral.\\n                \\nBronchodilators help open the airways by relaxing the muscles around them. These medicines are inhaled. They're often taken just before CPT to help clear mucus out of your airways. You also may take bronchodilators before inhaling other medicines into your lungs.\\n                \\nYour doctor may prescribe medicines to reduce the stickiness of your mucus and loosen it up. These medicines can help clear out mucus, improve lung function, and prevent worsening lung symptoms.\\n                \\nTreatments for Advanced Lung Disease\\n                \\nIf you have advanced lung disease, you may need oxygen therapy. Oxygen usually is given through nasal prongs or a mask.\\n                \\nIf other treatments haven't worked, a lung transplant may be an option if you have severe lung disease. A lung transplant is surgery to remove a person's diseased lung and replace it with a healthy lung from a deceased donor.\\n                \\nPulmonary Rehabilitation\\n                \\nYour doctor may recommend PR as part of your treatment plan. PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems.\\n                \\nPR doesn't replace medical therapy. Instead, it's used with medical therapy and may include:\\n                \\nExercise training\\n                \\nNutritional counseling\\n                \\nEducation on your lung disease or condition and how to manage it\\n                \\nEnergy-conserving techniques\\n                \\nBreathing strategies\\n                \\nPsychological counseling and/or group support\\n                \\nPR has many benefits. It can improve your ability to function and your quality of life. The program also may help relieve your breathing problems. Even if you have advanced lung disease, you can still benefit from PR.\\n                \\nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Pulmonary Rehabilitation article.\\n                \\nTreatment for Digestive Problems\\n                \\nCF can cause many digestive problems, such as bulky stools, intestinal gas, a swollen belly, severe constipation, and pain or discomfort. Digestive problems also can lead to poor growth and development in children.\\n                \\nNutritional therapy can improve your strength and ability to stay active. It also can improve growth and development in children. Nutritional therapy also may make you strong enough to resist some lung infections. A nutritionist can help you create a nutritional plan that meets your needs.\\n                \\nIn addition to having a well-balanced diet that's rich in calories, fat, and protein, your nutritional therapy may include:\\n                \\nOral pancreatic enzymes to help you digest fats and proteins and absorb more vitamins.\\n                \\nSupplements of vitamins A, D, E, and K to replace the fat-soluble vitamins that your intestines can't absorb.\\n                \\nHigh-calorie shakes to provide you with extra nutrients.\\n                \\nA high-salt diet or salt supplements that you take before exercising.\\n                \\nA feeding tube to give you more calories at night while you're sleeping. The tube may be threaded through your nose and throat and into your stomach. Or, the tube may be placed directly into your stomach through a surgically made hole. Before you go to bed each night, you'll attach a bag with a nutritional solution to the entrance of the tube. It will feed you while you sleep.\\n                \\nOther treatments for digestive problems may include enemas and mucus-thinning medicines to treat intestinal blockages. Sometimes surgery is needed to remove an intestinal blockage.\\n                \\nYour doctor also may prescribe medicines to reduce your stomach acid and help oral pancreatic enzymes work better.\\n                \\nTreatments for Cystic Fibrosis Complications\\n                \\nA common complication of CF is diabetes. The type of diabetes associated with CF often requires different treatment than other types of diabetes.\\n                \\nAnother common CF complication is the bone-thinning disorder osteoporosis. Your doctor may prescribe medicines that prevent your bones from losing their density.\", 'Heart failure is a condition in which the heart can\\'t pump enough blood to meet the body\\'s needs. In some cases, the heart can\\'t fill with enough blood. In other cases, the heart can\\'t pump blood to the rest of the body with enough force. Some people have both problems.\\n                \\nThe term \"heart failure\" doesn\\'t mean that your heart has stopped or is about to stop working. However, heart failure is a serious condition that requires medical care.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nHeart failure develops over time as the heart\\'s pumping action grows weaker. The condition can affect the right side of the heart only, or it can affect both sides of the heart. Most cases involve both sides of the heart.\\n                \\nRight-side heart failure occurs if the heart can\\'t pump enough blood to the lungs to pick up oxygen. Left-side heart failure occurs if the heart can\\'t pump enough oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body.\\n                \\nRight-side heart failure may cause fluid to build up in the feet, ankles, legs, liver, abdomen, and the veins in the neck. Right-side and left-side heart failure also may cause shortness of breath and fatigue (tiredness).\\n                \\nThe leading causes of heart failure are diseases that damage the heart. Examples include coronary heart disease (CHD), high blood pressure, and diabetes.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nHeart failure is a very common condition. About 5.7 million people in the United States have heart failure.Both children and adults can have the condition, although the symptoms and treatments differ. The Health Topicfocuses on heart failure in adults.\\n                \\nCurrently, heart failure has no cure. However, treatmentssuch as medicines and lifestyle changescan help people who have the condition live longer and more active lives. Researchers continue to study new ways to treat heart failure and its complications.', 'Conditions that damage or overwork the heart muscle can cause heart failure. Over time, the heart weakens. It isnt able to fill with and/or pump blood as well as it should. As the heart weakens, certain proteins and substances might be released into the blood. These substances have a toxic effect on the heart and blood flow, and they worsen heart failure.\\n                \\nCauses of heart failure include:\\n                \\nCoronary heart disease\\n                \\nDiabetes\\n                \\nHigh blood pressure\\n                \\nOther heart conditions or diseases\\n                \\nOther factors\\n                \\n\\n                \\nCoronary Heart Disease\\n                \\nCoronary heart disease is a condition in which a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside the coronary arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle.\\n                \\nPlaque narrows the arteries and reduces blood flow to your heart muscle. The buildup of plaque also makes it more likely that blood clots will form in your arteries. Blood clots can partially or completely block blood flow. Coronary heart disease can lead to chest pain or discomfort calledangina, aheart attack, and heart damage.\\n                \\n\\n                \\nDiabetes\\n                \\nDiabetes is a disease in which the bodys blood glucose (sugar) level is too high. The body normally breaks down food into glucose and then carries it to cells throughout the body. The cells use a hormone called insulin to turn the glucose into energy.\\n                \\nIn diabetes, the body doesnt make enough insulin or doesnt use its insulin properly. Over time, high blood sugar levels can damage and weaken the heart muscle and the blood vessels around the heart, leading to heart failure.\\n                \\n\\n                \\nHigh Blood Pressure\\n                \\nBlood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries. If this pressure rises and stays high over time, it can weaken your heart and lead to plaque buildup.\\n                \\nBlood pressure is considered high if it stays at or above 140/90 mmHg over time. (The mmHg is millimeters of mercurythe units used to measure blood pressure.) If you have diabetes or chronic kidney disease, high blood pressure is defined as 130/80 mmHg or higher.\\n                \\n\\n                \\nOther Heart Conditions or Diseases\\n                \\nOther conditions and diseases also can lead to heart failure, such as:\\n                \\nArrhythmia. Happens when a problem occurs with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat.\\n                \\nCardiomyopathy.Happens when the heart muscle becomes enlarged, thick, or rigid.\\n                \\nCongenital heart defects. Problems with the hearts structure are present at birth.\\n                \\nHeart valve disease. Occurs if one or more of your heart valves doesnt work properly, which can be present at birth or caused by infection, other heart conditions, and age.\\n                \\n\\n                \\nOther Factors\\n                \\nOther factors also can injure the heart muscle and lead to heart failure. Examples include:\\n                \\nAlcohol abuse or cocaine and other illegal drug use\\n                \\nHIV/AIDS\\n                \\nThyroid disorders (having either too much or too little thyroid hormone in the body)\\n                \\nToo much vitamin E\\n                \\nTreatments for cancer, such as radiation and chemotherapy']}"}, "time": 1746283465.656184}
