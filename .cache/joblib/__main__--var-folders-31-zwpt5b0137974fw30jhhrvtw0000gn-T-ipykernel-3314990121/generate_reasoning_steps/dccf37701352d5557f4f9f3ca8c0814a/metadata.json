You usually get the patches on your elbows, knees, scalp, back, face, palms and feet, but they can show up on other parts of your body. Some people who have psoriasis also get a form of arthritis called psoriatic arthritis.    A problem with your immune system causes psoriasis. In a process called cell turnover, skin cells that grow deep in your skin rise to the surface. Normally, this takes a month. In psoriasis, it happens in just days because your cells rise too fast.     Psoriasis can be hard to diagnose because it can look like other skin diseases. Your doctor might need to look at a small skin sample under a microscope.    Psoriasis can last a long time, even a lifetime. Symptoms come and go. Things that make them worse include       - Infections    - Stress    - Dry skin    - Certain medicines       Psoriasis usually occurs in adults. It sometimes runs in families. Treatments include creams, medicines, and light therapy.    NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'If you are having surgery, your doctor will give you medicine called an anesthetic. Anesthetics reduce or prevent pain. There are three main types:       - Local - numbs one small area of the body. You stay awake and alert.    - Regional - blocks pain in an area of the body, such an arm or leg. A common type is epidural anesthesia, which is often used during childbirth.    - General - makes you unconscious. You do not feel any pain, and you do not remember the procedure afterwards.       You may also get a mild sedative to relax you. You stay awake but may not remember the procedure afterwards. Sedation can be used with or without anesthesia.    The type of anesthesia or sedation you get depends on many factors. They include the procedure you are having and your current health.', \"For most adults, moderate alcohol use is probably not harmful. However, about 18 million adult Americans have an alcohol use disorder. This means that their drinking causes distress and harm. It includes alcoholism and alcohol abuse.    Alcoholism, or alcohol dependence, is a disease that causes       - Craving - a strong need to drink    - Loss of control - not being able to stop drinking once you've started    - Physical dependence - withdrawal symptoms    - Tolerance - the need to drink more alcohol to feel the same effect       With alcohol abuse, you are not physically dependent, but you still have a serious problem. The drinking may cause problems at home, work, or school. It may cause you to put yourself in dangerous situations, or lead to legal or social problems.    Another common problem is binge drinking. It is drinking about five or more drinks in two hours for men. For women, it is about four or more drinks in two hours.    Too much alcohol is dangerous. Heavy drinking can increase the risk of certain cancers. It can cause damage to the liver, brain, and other organs. Drinking during pregnancy can harm your baby. Alcohol also increases the risk of death from car crashes, injuries, homicide, and suicide.    If you want to stop drinking, there is help. Start by talking to your health care provider. Treatment may include medicines, counseling, and support groups.

They commonly form where your bones are close to your skin, such as your ankles, back, elbows, heels and hips. You are at risk if you are bedridden, use a wheelchair, or are unable to change your position. Pressure sores can cause serious infections, some of which are life-threatening. They can be a problem for people in nursing homes.
