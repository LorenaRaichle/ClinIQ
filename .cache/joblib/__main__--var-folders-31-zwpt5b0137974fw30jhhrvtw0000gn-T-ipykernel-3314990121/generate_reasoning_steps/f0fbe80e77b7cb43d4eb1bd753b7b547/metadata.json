When this condition is caused by a mutation in the COL8A2 gene, it is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. In addition, an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern is apparent in some situations in which the condition is caused by alterations in an unknown gene.  In many families, the inheritance pattern is unknown.  Some cases result from new mutations in a gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.', 'These resources address the diagnosis or management of Fuchs endothelial dystrophy:  - Duke Eye Center: Corneal Disease  - Genetic Testing Registry: Corneal dystrophy, Fuchs endothelial 1  - Genetic Testing Registry: Corneal dystrophy, Fuchs endothelial, 2  - Genetic Testing Registry: Corneal dystrophy, Fuchs endothelial, 3  - Genetic Testing Registry: Corneal dystrophy, Fuchs endothelial, 4  - Genetic Testing Registry: Corneal dystrophy, Fuchs endothelial, 5  - Genetic Testing Registry: Corneal dystrophy, Fuchs endothelial, 6  - Genetic Testing Registry: Corneal dystrophy, Fuchs endothelial, 7  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Fuchs Dystrophy   These resources from MedlinePlus offer information about the diagnosis and management of various health conditions:  - Diagnostic Tests  - Drug Therapy  - Surgery and Rehabilitation  - Genetic Counseling   - Palliative Care', 'Familial dilated cardiomyopathy is a genetic form of heart disease. It occurs when heart (cardiac) muscle becomes stretched out in at least one chamber of the heart, causing the open area of the chamber to become enlarged (dilated). As a result, the heart is unable to pump blood as efficiently as usual. Eventually, all four chambers of the heart become dilated as the cardiac muscle tries to increase the amount of blood being pumped through the heart. However, as the cardiac muscle becomes increasingly thin and weakened, it is less able to pump blood. Over time, this condition results in heart failure.  It usually takes many years for symptoms of familial dilated cardiomyopathy to appear. They typically begin in mid-adulthood, but can occur at any time from infancy to late adulthood. Signs and symptoms of familial dilated cardiomyopathy can include an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia), shortness of breath (dyspnea), extreme tiredness (fatigue), fainting episodes (syncope), and swelling of the legs and feet. In some cases, the first sign of the disorder is sudden cardiac death. The severity of the condition varies among affected individuals, even in members of the same family.', 'It is estimated that 750,000 people in the United States have dilated cardiomyopathy; roughly half of these cases are familial.']}"}, "time": 1746283453.529244}
