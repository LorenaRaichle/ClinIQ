For example, your doctor may look for purplish areas on the skin or mucous membranes and pinpoint red spots on the skin. These are signs of bleeding under the skin.\\n                \\nDiagnostic Tests\\n                \\nYou'll likely have blood tests to check your platelet count. These tests usually include:\\n                \\nA complete blood count. This test checks the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. In ITP, the red and white blood cell counts are normal, but the platelet count is low.\\n                \\nA blood smear. For this test, some of your blood is put on a slide. A microscope is used to look at your platelets and other blood cells.\\n                \\nYou also may have a blood test to check for the antibodies (proteins) that attack platelets.\\n                \\nIf blood tests show that your platelet count is low, your doctor may recommend more tests to confirm a diagnosis of ITP. For example, bone marrow tests can show whether your bone marrow is making enough platelets.\\n                \\nIf you're at risk for HIV, hepatitis C, or H. pylori, your doctor may screen you for these infections, which might be linked to ITP.\\n                \\nSome people who have mild ITP have few or no signs of bleeding. They may be diagnosed only if a blood test done for another reason shows that they have low platelet counts.\", \"Treatment for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is based on how much and how often you're bleeding and your platelet count.\\n                \\nAdults who have mild ITP may not need any treatment, other than watching their symptoms and platelet counts. Adults who have ITP with very low platelet counts or bleeding problems often are treated.\\n                \\nThe acute (short-term) type of ITP that occurs in children often goes away within a few weeks or months. Children who have bleeding symptoms, other than merely bruising (purpura), usually are treated.\\n                \\nChildren who have mild ITP may not need treatment other than monitoring and followup to make sure their platelet counts return to normal.\\n                \\nMedicines\\n                \\nMedicines often are used as the first course of treatment for both children and adults.\\n                \\nCorticosteroids (cor-ti-co-STEER-roids), such as prednisone, are commonly used to treat ITP. These medicines, called steroids for short, help increase your platelet count. However, steroids have many side effects. Some people relapse (get worse) when treatment ends.\\n                \\nThe steroids used to treat ITP are different from the illegal steroids that some athletes take to enhance performance. Corticosteroids aren't habit-forming, even if you take them for many years.\\n                \\nOther medicines also are used to raise the platelet count. Some are given through a needle inserted into a vein. These medicines include rituximab, immune globulin, and anti-Rh (D) immunoglobulin.\\n                \\nMedicines also may be used with a procedure to remove the spleen called splenectomy (splee-NECK-tuh-mee).\\n                \\nIf medicines or splenectomy don't help, two newer medicineseltrombopag and romiplostimcan be used to treat ITP.\\n                \\nRemoval of the Spleen (Splenectomy)\\n                \\nIf needed, doctors can surgically remove the spleen. This organ is located in the upper left abdomen. The spleen is about the size of a golf ball in children and a baseball in adults.\\n                \\nThe spleen makes antibodies (proteins) that help fight infections. In ITP, these antibodies destroy platelets by mistake.\\n                \\nIf ITP hasn't responded to medicines, removing the spleen will reduce the destruction of platelets. However, it also may raise your risk for infections. Before you have the surgery, your doctor may give you vaccines to help prevent infections.\\n                \\nIf your spleen is removed, your doctor will explain what steps you can take to help avoid infections and what symptoms to watch for.\\n                \\nOther Treatments\\n                \\nPlatelet Transfusions\\n                \\nSome people who have ITP with severe bleeding may need to have platelet transfusions and be hospitalized. Some people will need platelet transfusions before having surgery.\\n                \\nFor a platelet transfusion, donor platelets from a blood bank are injected into the recipient's bloodstream. This increases the platelet count for a short time.\\n                \\nFor more information about platelet transfusions, go to the Health Topics Blood Transfusion article.\\n                \\nTreating Infections\\n                \\nSome infections can briefly lower your platelet count. Treating the infection may help increase your platelet count and reduce bleeding problems.\\n                \\nStopping Medicines\\n                \\nSome medicines can lower your platelet count or cause bleeding. Stopping the medicine can sometimes help raise your platelet count or prevent bleeding.\\n                \\nFor example, aspirin and ibuprofen are common medicines that increase the risk of bleeding. If you have ITP, your doctor may suggest that you avoid these medicines.\", \"You can't prevent immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), but you can prevent its complications.\\n                \\nTalk with your doctor about which medicines are safe for you. Your doctor may advise you to avoid medicines that can affect your platelets and increase your risk of bleeding. Examples of such medicines include aspirin and ibuprofen.\\n                \\nProtect yourself from injuries that can cause bruising or bleeding.\\n                \\nSeek treatment right away if you develop any infections. Report any symptoms of infection, such as a fever, to your doctor. This is very important for people who have ITP and have had their spleens removed.\", \"Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is a condition in which the heart suddenly and unexpectedly stops beating. If this happens, blood stops flowing to the brain and other vital organs.\\n                \\nSCA usually causes death if it's not treated within minutes.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nTo understand SCA, it helps to understand how the heart works. The heart has an electrical system that controls the rate and rhythm of the heartbeat. Problems with the heart's electrical system can cause irregular heartbeats called arrhythmias.\\n                \\nThere are many types of arrhythmias. During an arrhythmia, the heart can beat too fast, too slow, or with an irregular rhythm. Some arrhythmias can cause the heart to stop pumping blood to the bodythese arrhythmias cause SCA.\\n                \\nSCA is not the same as a heart attack. A heart attack occurs if blood flow to part of the heart muscle is blocked. During a heart attack, the heart usually doesn't suddenly stop beating. SCA, however, may happen after or during recovery from a heart attack.\\n                \\nPeople who have heart disease are at higher risk for SCA. However, SCA can happen in people who appear healthy and have no known heart disease or other risk factors for SCA.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nMost people who have SCA die from itoften within minutes. Rapid treatment of SCA with a defibrillator can be lifesaving. A defibrillator is a device that sends an electric shock to the heart to try to restore its normal rhythm.\\n                \\nAutomated external defibrillators (AEDs) can be used by bystanders to save the lives of people who are having SCA. These portable devices often are found in public places, such as shopping malls, golf courses, businesses, airports, airplanes, casinos, convention centers, hotels, sports venues, and schools.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283466.263864}
