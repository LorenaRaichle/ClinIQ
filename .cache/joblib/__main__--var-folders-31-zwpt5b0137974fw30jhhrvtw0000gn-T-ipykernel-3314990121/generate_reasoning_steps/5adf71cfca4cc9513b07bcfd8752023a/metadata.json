Approximately 3 to 5 percent of these cancers are caused by Lynch syndrome.', 'Variations in the MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, or EPCAM gene increase the risk of developing Lynch syndrome.  The MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 genes are involved in the repair of mistakes that occur when DNA is copied in preparation for cell division (a process called DNA replication). Mutations in any of these genes prevent the proper repair of DNA replication mistakes. As the abnormal cells continue to divide, the accumulated mistakes can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and possibly cancer.  Mutations in the EPCAM gene also lead to impaired DNA repair, although the gene is not itself involved in this process. The EPCAM gene lies next to the MSH2 gene on chromosome 2; certain EPCAM gene mutations cause the MSH2 gene to be turned off (inactivated), interrupting DNA repair and leading to accumulated DNA mistakes.  Although mutations in these genes predispose individuals to cancer, not all people who carry these mutations develop cancerous tumors.', 'Lynch syndrome cancer risk is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one inherited copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase cancer risk. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop cancer.', 'These resources address the diagnosis or management of Lynch syndrome:  - American Medical Association and National Coalition for Health Professional Education in Genetics: Understand the Basics of Genetic Testing for Hereditary Colorectal Cancer  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Lynch Syndrome  - GeneFacts: Lynch Syndrome: Management  - Genetic Testing Registry: Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer type 3  - Genetic Testing Registry: Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer type 4  - Genetic Testing Registry: Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer type 5  - Genetic Testing Registry: Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer type 8  - Genetic Testing Registry: Lynch syndrome  - Genetic Testing Registry: Lynch syndrome I  - Genetic Testing Registry: Lynch syndrome II  - Genomics Education Programme (UK)  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Colon Cancer  - National Cancer Institute: Genetic Testing for Hereditary Cancer Syndromes   These resources from MedlinePlus offer information about the diagnosis and management of various health conditions:  - Diagnostic Tests  - Drug Therapy  - Surgery and Rehabilitation  - Genetic Counseling   - Palliative Care']}"}, "time": 1746283447.810443}
