It is characterized by multiple enchondromas (benign enlargements of cartilage), bone deformities, and hemangiomas (tangles of abnormal of blood vessels). The abnormal growths associated with Maffucci syndrome may become cancerous (malignant). In particular, affected individuals may develop bone cancers called chondrosarcomas, especially in the skull. They also have an increased risk of other cancers, such as ovarian or liver cancer. The underlying cause of Maffucci syndrome is unknown. No specific genes related to this disorder have been identified. Researchers suggest that the condition may be associated with abnormalities occurring before birth in the development of two embryonic cell layers called the ectoderm and the mesoderm.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Maffucci syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Maffucci syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the metaphyses 90% Abnormality of the skin 90% Cavernous hemangioma 90% Lower limb asymmetry 90% Micromelia 90% Multiple enchondromatosis 90% Osteolysis 90% Recurrent fractures 90% Thrombophlebitis 90% Visceral angiomatosis 90% Abnormal joint morphology 50% Bone pain 50% Exostoses 50% Limitation of joint mobility 50% Scoliosis 50% Short stature 50% Abnormality of coagulation 7.5% Anemia 7.5% Cerebral palsy 7.5% Cranial nerve paralysis 7.5% Feeding difficulties in infancy 7.5% Goiter 7.5% Lymphangioma 7.5% Neoplasm of the adrenal gland 7.5% Neoplasm of the breast 7.5% Neoplasm of the nervous system 7.5% Neoplasm of the parathyroid gland 7.5% Ovarian neoplasm 7.5% Platyspondyly 7.5% Precocious puberty 7.5% Respiratory insufficiency 7.5% Sarcoma 7.5% Skin ulcer 7.5% Chondrosarcoma - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'How might Maffucci syndrome be treated? Management aims at relief of symptoms and early detection of malignancies. Individuals with Maffucci syndrome may benefit from consultations with the following specialists: Radiologist: Radiography or CT scanning performed periodically to evaluate bone changes. Orthopedic surgeon: An orthopedic surgeon may be consulted to evaluate bone changes and skeletal neoplasms and to help in treatment of fractures associated with the disease. Dermatologist: A dermatologist may be consulted to evaluate hemangiomas associated with the condition and to identify any new lesions on the skin.', 'Fryns syndrome is a condition that affects the development of many parts of the body. Signs and symptoms vary widely among affected individuals. Many affected individuals have a defect in the diaphragm muscle such as a congenital diaphragmatic hernia (a hole in the diaphragm present at birth). This may allow the stomach and intestines to move into the chest, which can result in pulmonary hypoplasia (underdevelopment of the lungs). Other signs and symptoms may include abnormalities of the fingers and toes; distinctive facial features; severe developmental delay and intellectual disability; and abnormalities of the brain, cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal system, kidneys, and genitalia. Most affected individuals die before birth or in early infancy. The cause of the condition is not known, but it is thought to be genetic and appears to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.']}"}, "time": 1746283457.579853}
