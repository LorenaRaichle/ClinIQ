Juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is often genetic and may be caused by mutations in the ALS2 or SETX genes. In some cases the underlying gene abnormality cannot be determined. Juvenile ALS may be inherited in an autosomal dominant (as in ALS type 4) or autosomal recessive (as in ALS type 2) fashion.', 'How might juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis be treated? Treatments and therapies are available to relieve symptoms and improve the quality of life of people with juvenile ALS. Medications, such as those that reduce fatigue and ease muscle cramps are available. Physical therapy and special equipment can be helpful. Multidisciplinary teams of health care professionals such as physicians; pharmacists; physical, occupational, and speech therapists; nutritionists; and social workers can help to develop personalized treatment plans. While the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved riluzole (Rilutek) for treatment of ALS, we found limited information regarding its use for juvenile ALS. We recommend that you discuss any questions regarding the risk/benefits of this drug with your healthcare provider.', 'Ohtahara syndrome is a neurological disorder characterized by seizures.  The disorder affects newborns, usually within the first three months of life (most often within the first 10 days) in the form of epileptic seizures.  Infants have primarily tonic seizures (which cause stiffening of muscles of the body, generally those in the back, legs, and arms), but may also experience partial seizures, and rarely, myoclonic seizures (which cause jerks or twitches of the upper body, arms, or legs). Ohtahara syndrome is most commonly caused by metabolic disorders or structural damage in the brain, although the cause or causes for many cases cant be determined. Most infants with the disorder show significant underdevelopment of part or all of the cerebral hemispheres.  The EEGs of infants with Ohtahara syndrome reveal a characteristic pattern of high voltage spike wave discharge followed by little activity.  This pattern is known as burst suppression. The seizures associated with Ohtahara syndrome are difficult to treat and the syndrome is severely progressive. Some children with this condition go on to develop other epileptic disorders such as West syndrome and Lennox-Gestaut syndrome.', 'Spinocerebellar ataxia 2 (SCA2) is a progressive disorder that causes symptoms including uncoordinated movement (ataxia), speech and swallowing difficulties, muscle wasting, slow eye movement, and sometimes dementia. Signs and symptoms usually begin in mid-adulthood but can appear any time from childhood to late-adulthood. SCA2 is caused by mutations in the ATXN2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.']}"}, "time": 1746283454.9243011}
