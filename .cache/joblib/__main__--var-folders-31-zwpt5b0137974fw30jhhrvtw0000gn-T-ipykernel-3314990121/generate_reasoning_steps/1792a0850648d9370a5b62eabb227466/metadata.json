The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 6. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Apnea - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Cerebellar atrophy - Cerebellar hypoplasia - Cerebral atrophy - Congenital onset - Death in childhood - Deeply set eye - Failure to thrive - Hyperreflexia - Increased CSF lactate - Increased serum lactate - Lower limb spasticity - Muscular hypotonia - Narrow forehead - Narrow palate - Poor head control - Poor suck - Progressive - Progressive microcephaly - Prominent nasal bridge - Seizures - Upper limb spasticity - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', \"Gangliocytoma is a rare type of central nervous system (CNS) tumor made up of mature neurons. Gangliocytomas may occur in all age groups but most often occur in people between the ages of 10 and 30. The most common site is the temporal lobe of the brain, but they can arise anywhere in the CNS including the cerebellum, brainstem, floor of the third ventricle, and spinal cord. They are among the most frequent tumors associated with epilepsy. Signs and symptoms may depend on the tumor's location and may include seizures (most commonly); increased brain pressure; endocrine disorders; and focal symptoms. Gangliocytomas are generally slow-growing and usually do not become malignant. Treatment involves surgical removal of the tumor.

Signs and symptoms caused by the presence of a gangliocytoma can vary depending on the tumor's location. Seizures are the most common symptom. Other symptoms may include increased brain pressure, endocrine disorders, and focal symptoms. Gangliocytomas can also be asymptomatic (cause no symptoms) and may be diagnosed incidentally on imaging studies.\", 'What are the signs and symptoms of Amish lethal microcephaly?
