Often the first sign of melanoma is a change in the size, shape, color, or feel of a mole. Most melanomas have a black or black-blue area. Melanoma may also appear as a new mole. It may be black, abnormal, or \"ugly looking.\"    Thinking of \"ABCDE\" can help you remember what to watch for:       -  Asymmetry - the shape of one half does not match the other    -  Border - the edges are ragged, blurred or irregular    -  Color - the color is uneven and may include shades of black, brown and tan    -  Diameter - there is a change in size, usually an increase    - Evolving - the mole has changed over the past few weeks or months       Surgery is the first treatment of all stages of melanoma. Other treatments include chemotherapy and radiation, biologic, and targeted therapies. Biologic therapy boosts your body\\'s own ability to fight cancer. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells.    NIH: National Cancer Institute', 'Marfan syndrome is a disorder that affects connective tissue. Connective tissues are proteins that support skin, bones, blood vessels, and other organs. One of these proteins is fibrillin. A problem with the fibrillin gene causes Marfan syndrome.     Marfan syndrome can be mild to severe, and the symptoms can vary. People with Marfan syndrome are often very tall, thin, and loose jointed. Most people with Marfan syndrome have heart and blood vessel problems, such as a weakness in the aorta or heart valves that leak. They may also have problems with their bones, eyes, skin, nervous system, and lungs.    There is no single test to diagnose Marfan syndrome. Your doctor may use your medical history, family history, and a physical exam to diagnose it. Marfan syndrome has no cure, but treatments can help delay or prevent complications. Treatments include medicines, surgery, and other therapies.    NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', \"Summary : Most men need to pay more attention to their health. Compared to women, men are more likely to       - Smoke and drink    - Make unhealthy or risky choices    - Put off regular checkups and medical care       There are also health conditions that only affect men, such as prostate cancer and low testosterone. Many of the major health risks that men face - like colon cancer or heart disease - can be prevented and treated with early diagnosis. Screening tests can find diseases early, when they are easier to treat. It's important to get the screening tests you need.\", \"Many people enjoy gambling, whether it's betting on a horse or playing poker on the Internet. Most people who gamble don't have a problem, but some lose control of their gambling. Signs of problem gambling include        -  Always thinking about gambling    -  Lying about gambling    -  Spending work or family time gambling     -  Feeling bad after you gamble, but not quitting     -  Gambling with money you need for other things       If you have concerns about your gambling, ask for help. Your health care provider can work with you to find the treatment that's best for you.    NIH: National Institutes of Health\"]}"}, "time": 1746283467.7380989}
