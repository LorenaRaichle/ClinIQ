The condition occurs in 1 in 15,000 to 40,000 newborns.', 'Mutations in the FGFR3 gene cause achondroplasia. The FGFR3 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the development and maintenance of bone and brain tissue. Two specific mutations in the FGFR3 gene are responsible for almost all cases of achondroplasia. Researchers believe that these mutations cause the FGFR3 protein to be overly active, which interferes with skeletal development and leads to the disturbances in bone growth seen with this disorder.', 'Achondroplasia is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. About 80 percent of people with achondroplasia have average-size parents; these cases result from new mutations in the FGFR3 gene. In the remaining cases, people with achondroplasia have inherited an altered FGFR3 gene from one or two affected parents. Individuals who inherit two altered copies of this gene typically have a severe form of achondroplasia that causes extreme shortening of the bones and an underdeveloped rib cage. These individuals are usually stillborn or die shortly after birth from respiratory failure.', 'These resources address the diagnosis or management of achondroplasia:  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Achondroplasia  - GeneFacts: Achondroplasia: Diagnosis  - GeneFacts: Achondroplasia: Management  - Genetic Testing Registry: Achondroplasia  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Achondroplasia  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Hydrocephalus  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Lordosis  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Spinal Stenosis   These resources from MedlinePlus offer information about the diagnosis and management of various health conditions:  - Diagnostic Tests  - Drug Therapy  - Surgery and Rehabilitation  - Genetic Counseling   - Palliative Care']}"}, "time": 1746283448.017632}
