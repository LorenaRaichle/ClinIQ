The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Hereditary sensory neuropathy type IE. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Apathy - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Cerebral atrophy - Decreased number of peripheral myelinated nerve fibers - Dementia - Hyporeflexia - Impulsivity - Irritability - Memory impairment - Osteomyelitis - Progressive - Sensorineural hearing impairment - Sensory neuropathy - Somnolence - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'How is hereditary sensory neuropathy type IE inherited? Hereditary sensory neuropathy type IE (HSNIE) is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that having only one changed (mutated) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause features of the condition. When a person with a mutation that causes HSNIE has children, each child has a 50% (1/2) chance to inherit the mutated gene. A person who does not inherit the mutation from an affected parent is not at risk to pass the condition on to his/her children.', 'How might hereditary sensory neuropathy type IE be treated? There is currently no effective treatment for any type of hereditary sensory neuropathy. Management of symptoms may include: meticulous care of the distal limbs, which includes proper fit of shoes, prevention and treatment of callus formation, cleaning and protection of wounds, and avoidance of trauma to the hands and feet injury prevention when sensory impairment is significant the use of hearing aids and/or assistive communication methods as needed sedative or antipsychotic medications to help reduce the restlessness, roaming behavior, delusions, and hallucinations associated with dementia psychological support for caregivers', \"Leukonychia totalis is a nail condition characterized by complete whitening of the entire nail plate. It is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Less commonly, it may be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, or acquired (not inherited) during a person's lifetime. The inherited forms can be caused by mutations in the PLCD1 gene and generally involve the entire plate of all 20 nails. In some cases, leukonychia totalis has been associated with various other abnormalities or syndromes. Treatment may focus on the underlying cause when it is associated with another condition.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283457.167459}
