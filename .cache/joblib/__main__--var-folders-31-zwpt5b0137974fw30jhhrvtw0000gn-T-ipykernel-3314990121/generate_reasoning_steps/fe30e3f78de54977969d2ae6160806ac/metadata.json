During an arrhythmia, the heart can beat too fast, too slow, or with an irregular rhythm.\\n                \\nA heartbeat that is too fast is called tachycardia (TAK-ih-KAR-de-ah). A heartbeat that is too slow is called bradycardia (bray-de-KAR-de-ah).\\n                \\nMost arrhythmias are harmless, but some can be serious or even life threatening. During an arrhythmia, the heart may not be able to pump enough blood to the body. Lack of blood flow can damage the brain, heart, and other organs.\\n                \\nUnderstanding the Heart's Electrical System\\n                \\nTo understand arrhythmias, it helps to understand the heart's internal electrical system. The heart's electrical system controls the rate and rhythm of the heartbeat.\\n                \\nWith each heartbeat, an electrical signal spreads from the top of the heart to the bottom. As the signal travels, it causes the heart to contract and pump blood.\\n                \\nEach electrical signal begins in a group of cells called the sinus node or sinoatrial (SA) node. The SA node is located in the heart's upper right chamber, the right atrium (AY-tree-um). In a healthy adult heart at rest, the SA node fires off an electrical signal to begin a new heartbeat 60 to 100 times a minute.\\n                \\nFrom the SA node, the electrical signal travels through special pathways in the right and left atria. This causes the atria to contract and pump blood into the heart's two lower chambers, the ventricles (VEN-trih-kuls).\\n                \\nThe electrical signal then moves down to a group of cells called the atrioventricular (AV) node, located between the atria and the ventricles. Here, the signal slows down just a little, allowing the ventricles time to finish filling with blood.\\n                \\nThe electrical signal then leaves the AV node and travels along a pathway called the bundle of His. This pathway divides into a right bundle branch and a left bundle branch. The signal goes down these branches to the ventricles, causing them to contract and pump blood to the lungs and the rest of the body.\\n                \\nThe ventricles then relax, and the heartbeat process starts all over again in the SA node. (For more information about the heart's electrical system, including detailed animations, go to the Health Topics How the Heart Works article.)\\n                \\nA problem with any part of this process can cause an arrhythmia. For example, in atrial fibrillation (A-tre-al fi-bri-LA-shun), a common type of arrhythmia, electrical signals travel through the atria in a fast and disorganized way. This causes the atria to quiver instead of contract.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nThere are many types of arrhythmia. Most arrhythmias are harmless, but some are not. The outlook for a person who has an arrhythmia depends on the type and severity of the arrhythmia.\\n                \\nEven serious arrhythmias often can be successfully treated. Most people who have arrhythmias are able to live normal, healthy lives.\", 'An arrhythmia can occur if the electrical signals that control the heartbeat are delayed or blocked. This can happen if the special nerve cells that produce electrical signals don\\'t work properly. It also can happen if the electrical signals don\\'t travel normally through the heart.\\n                \\nAn arrhythmia also can occur if another part of the heart starts to produce electrical signals. This adds to the signals from the special nerve cells and disrupts the normal heartbeat.\\n                \\nSmoking, heavy alcohol use, use of some drugs (such as cocaine or amphetamines), use of some prescription or over-the-counter medicines, or too much caffeine or nicotine can lead to arrhythmias in some people.\\n                \\nStrong emotional stress or anger can make the heart work harder, raise blood pressure, and release stress hormones. Sometimes these reactions can lead to arrhythmias.\\n                \\nA heart attack or other condition that damages the heart\\'s electrical system also can cause arrhythmias. Examples of such conditions include high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, heart failure, an overactive or underactive thyroid gland (too much or too little thyroid hormone produced), and rheumatic heart disease.\\n                \\nCongenital (kon-JEN-ih-tal) heart defects can cause some arrhythmias, such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. The term \"congenital means the defect is present at birth.\\n                \\nSometimes the cause of arrhythmias is unknown.', \"Arrhythmias are very common in older adults. Atrial fibrillation (a common type of arrhythmia that can cause problems) affects millions of people, and the number is rising.\\n                \\nMost serious arrhythmias affect people older than 60. This is because older adults are more likely to have heart disease and other health problems that can lead to arrhythmias.\\n                \\nOlder adults also tend to be more sensitive to the side effects of medicines, some of which can cause arrhythmias. Some medicines used to treat arrhythmias can even cause arrhythmias as a side effect.\\n                \\nSome types of arrhythmia happen more often in children and young adults. Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), including Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, is more common in young people. PSVT is a fast heart rate that begins and ends suddenly.\\n                \\nMajor Risk Factors\\n                \\nArrhythmias are more common in people who have diseases or conditions that weaken the heart, such as:\\n                \\nHeart attack\\n                \\nHeart failure or cardiomyopathy, which weakens the heart and changes the way electrical signals move through the heart\\n                \\nHeart tissue that's too thick or stiff or that hasn't formed normally\\n                \\nLeaking or narrowed heart valves, which make the heart work too hard and can lead to heart failure\\n                \\nCongenital heart defects (defects present at birth) that affect the heart's structure or function\\n                \\nOther conditions also can raise the risk for arrhythmias, such as:\\n                \\nHigh blood pressure\\n                \\nInfections that damage the heart muscle or the sac around the heart\\n                \\nDiabetes, which increases the risk of high blood pressure and coronary heart disease\\n                \\nSleep apnea, which can stress the heart because the heart doesn't get enough oxygen\\n                \\nAn overactive or underactive thyroid gland (too much or too little thyroid hormone in the body)\\n                \\nSeveral other risk factors also can raise your risk for arrhythmias. Examples include heart surgery, certain drugs (such as cocaine or amphetamines), or an imbalance of chemicals or other substances (such as potassium) in the bloodstream.\", 'Many arrhythmias cause no signs or symptoms. When signs or symptoms are present, the most common ones are:\\n                \\nPalpitations (feelings that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, or beating too hard or fast)\\n                \\nA slow heartbeat\\n                \\nAn irregular heartbeat\\n                \\nFeeling pauses between heartbeats\\n                \\nMore serious signs and symptoms include:\\n                \\nAnxiety\\n                \\nWeakness, dizziness, and light-headedness\\n                \\nFainting or nearly fainting\\n                \\nSweating\\n                \\nShortness of breath\\n                \\nChest pain']}"}, "time": 1746283466.503267}
