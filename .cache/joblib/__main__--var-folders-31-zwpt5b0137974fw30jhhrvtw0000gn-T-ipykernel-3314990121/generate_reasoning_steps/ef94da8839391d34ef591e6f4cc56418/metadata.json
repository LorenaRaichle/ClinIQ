Diabetic mastopathy is a benign condition and should be managed as such. Patients should be advised about the condition and how to self examine the breasts. They should be advised that iif there are any changes in size and number of breast lumps that they should consult their breast team or general practitioner. Patients should be routinely followed up with MRI or ultrasound and core biopsy if the lesions become clinically or radiologically suspicious. Lesions can be excised for cosmetic reasons or if malignancy cannot be excluded. No followup is recommended when malignancy has been ruled out.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Amino aciduria with mental deficiency, dwarfism, muscular dystrophy, osteoporosis and acidosis? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Amino aciduria with mental deficiency, dwarfism, muscular dystrophy, osteoporosis and acidosis. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Acidosis - Aminoaciduria - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Intellectual disability - Muscular dystrophy - Osteoporosis - Severe short stature - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Mesomelia-synostoses syndrome?

It is most common in Caucasian women who have mental illness or emotional stress. Symptoms typically include the formation of multiple, small, purple bruises that may be associated with burning, redness and swelling. Most affected people report that the bruising occurs either spontaneously, or some time after trauma or surgery at other sites of the body. The cause of GDS is poorly understood. Management typically involves psychiatric treatment.']}"}, "time": 1746283460.021013}
