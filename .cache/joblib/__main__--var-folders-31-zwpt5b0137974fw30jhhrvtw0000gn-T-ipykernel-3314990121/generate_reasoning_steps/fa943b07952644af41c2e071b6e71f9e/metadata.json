Mitochondria are tiny structures found in almost every cell of the body. They are responsible for creating most of the energy necessary to sustain life and support growth. People affected by this condition generally experience early-onset lactic acidosis, severe encephalopathy, seizures, poor growth, hypotonia, and developmental delay. It is caused by changes (mutations) in the LIAS gene and it is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Lipoic acid synthetase deficiency? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Lipoic acid synthetase deficiency. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Apnea - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Encephalopathy - Feeding difficulties - Flexion contracture - Growth delay - Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy - Increased serum lactate - Lactic acidosis - Microcephaly - Motor delay - Muscular hypotonia - Respiratory insufficiency - Seizures - Severe global developmental delay - Sleep disturbance - Spastic tetraplegia - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) is a rare condition that affects the lymph nodes and related tissues. It is a form of Castleman disease that is \"systemic\" and affects multiple sets of lymph nodes and other tissues throughout the body (as opposed to unicentric Castleman disease which has more \"localized\" effects). The signs and symptoms of MCD are often nonspecific and blamed on other, more common conditions. They can vary but may include fever; weight loss; fatigue; night sweats; enlarged lymph nodes; nausea and vomiting; and an enlarged liver or spleen. The eact underlying cause is unknown. Treatment may involve immunotherapy, chemotherapy, corticosteroid medications and/or anti-viral drugs.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of multicentric Castleman disease? The signs and symptoms of multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) are often nonspecific and blamed on other, more common conditions. They can vary but may include: Fever Enlarged lymph nodes Night sweats Loss of appetite and weight loss Weakness and fatigue Shortness of breath Nausea and vomiting Enlarged liver or spleen Peripheral neuropathy Skin abnormalities such as rashes and/or pemphigus Less commonly (<10% of cases), people affected by MCD will have no signs or symptoms of the condition. Other conditions associated with MCD include amyloidosis, POEMS syndrome, autoimmune disease, hemolytic anemia, and immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).']}"}, "time": 1746283456.321364}
