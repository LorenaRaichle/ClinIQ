It can lead to premature birth. Premature babies may face serious health risks.     Symptoms of preterm labor include       - Contractions every 10 minutes or more often    - Leaking fluid or bleeding from the vagina    - Feeling of pressure in the pelvis    - Low, dull backache    - Cramps that feel like menstrual cramps    - Abdominal cramps with or without diarrhea        If you think you might be having preterm labor, contact your health care provider.     NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'An acoustic neuroma is a benign tumor that develops on the nerve that connects the ear to the brain. The tumor usually grows slowly. As it grows, it presses against the hearing and balance nerves. At first, you may have no symptoms or mild symptoms. They can include       -  Loss of hearing on one side     -  Ringing in ears    -  Dizziness and balance problems       The tumor can also eventually cause numbness or paralysis of the face. If it grows large enough, it can press against the brain, becoming life-threatening.    Acoustic neuroma can be difficult to diagnose, because the symptoms are similar to those of middle ear problems. Ear exams, hearing tests, and scans can show if you have it.    If the tumor stays small, you may only need to have it checked regularly. If you do need treatment, surgery and radiation are options.    If the tumors affect both hearing nerves, it is often because of a genetic disorder called neurofibromatosis.    NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Communication Disorders', \"Summary : Pulmonary rehabilitation (rehab) is a medically supervised program to help people who have chronic breathing problems, including       - COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)    - Sarcoidosis    - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis    - Cystic fibrosis       During pulmonary rehab you may do exercise training and learn breathing techniques. You'll also get tips on conserving your energy and advice on nutrition and coping. These can't cure your lung disease or completely ease your breathing problems. But it can help you function better in your daily life.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\", \"Respiratory failure happens when not enough oxygen passes from your lungs into your blood. Your body's organs, such as your heart and brain, need oxygen-rich blood to work well. Respiratory failure also can happen if your lungs can't remove carbon dioxide (a waste gas) from your blood. Too much carbon dioxide in your blood can harm your body's organs.    Diseases and conditions that affect your breathing can cause respiratory failure. Examples include       - Lung diseases such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and cystic fibrosis    - Conditions that affect the nerves and muscles that control breathing, such as spinal cord injuries, muscular dystrophy and stroke    - Damage to the tissues and ribs around the lungs. An injury to the chest can cause this damage.    - Drug or alcohol overdose    - Injuries from inhaling smoke or harmful fumes       Treatment for respiratory failure depends on whether the condition is acute (short-term) or chronic (ongoing) and how severe it is. It also depends on the underlying cause. You may receive oxygen therapy and other treatment to help you breathe.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\"]}"}, "time": 1746283466.793331}
