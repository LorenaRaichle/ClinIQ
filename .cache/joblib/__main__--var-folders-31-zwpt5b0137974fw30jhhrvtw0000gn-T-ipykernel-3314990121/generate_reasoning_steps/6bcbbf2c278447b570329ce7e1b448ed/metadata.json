Some common types of skin infections are       - Bacterial: Cellulitis and impetigo. Staphylococcal infections can also affect the skin.    - Viral: Shingles, warts, and herpes simplex    - Fungal: Athlete's foot and yeast infections    - Parasitic: Body lice, head lice, and scabies       Treatment of skin infections depends on the cause.\", 'Children vary in their development of speech and language skills. Health professionals have milestones for what\\'s normal. These milestones help determine if a child is on track or if he or she may need extra help. For example, a child usually has one or two words like \"Hi,\" \"dog,\" \"Dada,\" or \"Mama\" by her first birthday.    Sometimes a delay may be caused by hearing loss, while other times it may be due to a speech or language disorder. Language disorders can mean that the child has trouble understanding what others say or difficulty sharing her thoughts. Children who have trouble producing speech sounds correctly or who hesitate or stutter when talking may have a speech disorder.    If your child\\'s speech or language appears to be delayed, talk to your child\\'s doctor.    NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Summary : After a serious injury, illness or surgery, you may recover slowly. You may need to regain your strength, relearn skills or find new ways of doing things you did before. This process is rehabilitation.     Rehabilitation often focuses on       -  Physical therapy to help your strength, mobility and fitness    -  Occupational therapy to help you with your daily activities    -  Speech-language therapy to help with speaking, understanding, reading, writing and swallowing    -  Treatment of pain       The type of therapy and goals of therapy may be different for different people. An older person who has had a stroke may simply want rehabilitation to be able to dress or bathe without help. A younger person who has had a heart attack may go through cardiac rehabilitation to try to return to work and normal activities. Someone with a lung disease may get pulmonary rehabilitation to be able to breathe better and improve their quality of life.', \"Your adrenal, or suprarenal, glands are located on the top of each kidney. These glands produce hormones that you can't live without, including sex hormones and cortisol, which helps you respond to stress and has many other functions.    A number of disorders can affect the adrenal glands, including tumors. Tumors can be either benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer. Malignant ones are. Most adrenal gland tumors are benign. They usually do not cause symptoms and may not require treatment. Malignant adrenal gland cancers are uncommon.    Types of tumors include       - Adrenocortical carcinoma - cancer in the outer part of the gland    - Neuroblastoma, a type of childhood cancer    - Pheochromocytoma - a rare tumor that is usually benign       Symptoms depend on the type of cancer you have. Treatments may include surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283466.6672509}
