Generally, individuals with the disorder appear \"out of sync\" with their environment. Symptoms vary and may include poor balance and coordination, clumsiness, vision problems, perception difficulties, emotional and behavioral problems, difficulty with reading, writing, and speaking, poor social skills, poor posture, and poor short-term memory. Although individuals with the disorder may be of average or above average intelligence, they may behave immaturely.', 'Treatment is symptomatic and supportive and may include occupational and speech therapy, and \"cueing\" or other forms of communication such as using pictures and hand gestures. Many children with the disorder require special education.', 'Developmental dyspraxia is a lifelong disorder. Many individuals are able to compensate for their disabilities through occupational and speech therapy.', 'The NINDS supports research on developmental disorders, such as developmental dyspraxia, aimed at learning more about these disorders, and finding ways to prevent and treat them.']}"}, "time": 1746283462.233495}
