Even though most infants and toddlers have received all recommended vaccines by age 2, many under-immunized children remain, leaving the potential for outbreaks of disease. Many adolescents and adults are under-immunized as well, missing opportunities to protect themselves against diseases such as Hepatitis B, influenza, and pneumococcal disease. CDC works closely with public health agencies and private partners to improve and sustain immunization coverage and to monitor the safety of vaccines so that this public health success story can be maintained and expanded in the century to come.

However, if the individual is experiencing fever and fatigue and has a history of potential rural rodent exposure, together with shortness of breath, would be strongly suggestive of HPS. If the individual is experiencing these symptoms they should see their physician immediately and mention their potential rodent exposure.\\n  Treating HPS\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n     \\n   \\n  \\n  \\nThere is no specific treatment, cure, or vaccine for hantavirus infection. However, we do know that if infected individuals are recognized early and receive medical care in an intensive care unit, they may do better. In intensive care, patients are intubated and given oxygen therapy to help them through the period of severe respiratory distress.\\n  \\nThe earlier the patient is brought in to intensive care, the better. If a patient is experiencing full distress, it is less likely the treatment will be effective.\\n  \\nTherefore, if you have been around rodents and have symptoms of fever, deep muscle aches, and severe shortness of breath, see your doctor immediately. Be sure to tell your doctor that you have been around rodents\u2014this will alert your physician to look closely for any rodent-carried disease, such as HPS.', 'Due to the small number of HPS cases, the \"incubation time\" is not positively known. However, on the basis of limited information, it appears that symptoms may develop between 1 and 5 weeks after exposure to fresh urine, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents.\\n  Early Symptoms\\n  \\n    \\n   \\nEarly symptoms include fatigue, fever and muscle aches, especially in the large muscle groups\u2014thighs, hips, back, and sometimes shoulders. These symptoms are universal.\\n   \\nThere may also be headaches, dizziness, chills, and abdominal problems, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. About half of all HPS patients experience these symptoms.\\n  \\n  Late Symptoms\\n  \\n    \\n   \\nFour to 10 days after the initial phase of illness, the late symptoms of HPS appear. These include coughing and shortness of breath, with the sensation of, as one survivor put it, a \"...tight band around my chest and a pillow over my face\" as the lungs fill with fluid.\\n  \\n  Is the Disease Fatal?\\n  \\nYes. HPS can be fatal. It has a mortality rate of 38%.']}"}, "time": 1746283483.77642}
