It usually begins in the bone marrow where blood cells are formed. In leukemia, the bone marrow produces abnormal white blood cells. Over time, as the number of abnormal white blood cells builds up in the blood, they crowd out healthy blood cells. This makes it difficult for the blood to carry out its normal functions.', 'Acute leukemia gets worse quickly. In chronic leukemia, symptoms develop gradually and are generally not as severe as in acute leukemia.', 'There are four common types of leukemia. They are chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and acute lymphocytic leukemia. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, and acute myeloid leukemia are diagnosed more often in older adults. Acute lymphocytic leukemia is found more often in children.

Learn more about acute myeloid leukemia.', \"Myeloma and lymphoma are other types of blood cancers. Both are common among older adults and occur more often in men than women. Myeloma affects plasma cells, a type of white blood cells typically found in the bone marrow. Lymphoma starts in the lymphatic system, which is part of the body's immune system.
