Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the voice 90% Hemiplegia/hemiparesis 90% Laryngomalacia 90% Ptosis 90% Premature birth 50% Short stature 50% Autosomal dominant inheritance - Bilateral ptosis - Vocal cord paralysis - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available.
