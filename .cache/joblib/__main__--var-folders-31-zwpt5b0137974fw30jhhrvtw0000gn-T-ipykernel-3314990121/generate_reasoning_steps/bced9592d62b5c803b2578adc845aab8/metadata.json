The diagnosis of SIOD is made on clinical findings.  The most definitive diagnostic findings are skeletal dysplasia (spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia), renal dysfunction (urinary protein loss), T lymphocyte deficiency, characteristic facial features, and hyperpigmented macules.  DNA testing for mutations in SMARCAL1 is available on a clinical basis.', \"How might Schimke immunoosseous dysplasia be treated? Treatment of Schimke immunoosseous dysplasia (SIOD) is based on addressing individual symptoms as they develop.  Renal transplantation can treat the renal disease, and bone marrow transplantation has been done to treat the immunodeficiency.  Blood thinning medications can transiently improve blood flow through the atherosclerotic arteries but do not provide enduring relief from cerebral ischemia.  Treatment with acyclovir and some antibacterial agents has been beneficial for preventing of reducing the frequency of opportunistic infections.  More detailed information about treatment for SIOD can be found on the GeneReview's Web site.

Specifically, the surface of the brain develops too many folds which are unusually small. The signs and symptoms associated with the condition vary based on how much of the brain and which areas of the brain are affected; however, affected people may experience recurrent seizures (epilepsy); delayed development; crossed eyes; problems with speech and swallowing; and muscle weakness or paralysis. Bilateral forms (affecting both sides of the brain) tend to cause more severe neurological problems. Polymicrogyria can result from both genetic and environmental causes. It may occur as an isolated finding or as part of a syndrome. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.', 'Michels syndrome is an extremely rare disorder characterized by the eyelid triad of blepharophimosis (a narrowing of the eye opening), blepharoptosis and epicanthus inversus (an upward fold of the skin of the lower eyelid near the inner corner of the eye), skeletal defects including craniosynostosis, cranial asymmetry, abnormality of the occipital bone (at the base of the skull), and radioulnar synostosis, cleft lip and palate, and mental deficiency. Only 10 cases have been reported in the medical literature. While the underlying cause of this condition remains unknown, it is believed to be transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait.  Based on phenotypic overlap and autosomal recessive inheritance, some researchers have suggested that Michels, Malpuech, Carnevale and Mingarelli syndromes represent a spectrum and should be referred to a 3MC syndrome (for Malpuech-Michels-Mingarelli-Carnevale).']}"}, "time": 1746283457.642745}
