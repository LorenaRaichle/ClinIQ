Babies with this condition are generally born without eyeballs (anophthalmia) or with eyes that are unusually small (microphthalmia). Both of these abnormalities can be associated with severe vision loss. Other signs and symptoms of syndromic microphthalmia, type 3 may include seizures, brain malformations, esophageal atresia, delayed motor development, learning disabilities, and sensorineural hearing loss. The condition is caused by changes (mutations) in the SOX2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Syndromic microphthalmia, type 3? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Syndromic microphthalmia, type 3. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Aplasia/Hypoplasia affecting the eye 90% Tracheoesophageal fistula 90% Abnormal form of the vertebral bodies 50% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the corpus callosum 50% Cryptorchidism 50% External ear malformation 50% Visual impairment 50% Abnormality of the ribs 7.5% Cognitive impairment 7.5% Displacement of the external urethral meatus 7.5% Holoprosencephaly 7.5% Hydrocephalus 7.5% Hypoplasia of penis 7.5% Iris coloboma 7.5% Patent ductus arteriosus 7.5% Sclerocornea 7.5% Ventricular septal defect 7.5% Agenesis of corpus callosum - Anophthalmia - Anterior pituitary hypoplasia - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Butterfly vertebrae - Coloboma - Esophageal atresia - Frontal bossing - Hemivertebrae - Hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism - Hypoplasia of the corpus callosum - Hypospadias - Hypothalamic hamartoma - Microcephaly - Micropenis - Microphthalmia - Missing ribs - Muscular hypotonia - Optic nerve hypoplasia - Postnatal growth retardation - Rib fusion - Sensorineural hearing impairment - Short stature - Spastic diplegia - Spastic tetraplegia - Specific learning disability - Supernumerary ribs - Vertebral fusion - Vertebral hypoplasia - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) is a condition characterized mainly by a loss of the muscle functions involved in eye and eyelid movement. Signs and symptoms tend to begin in early adulthood and most commonly include weakness or paralysis of the muscles that move the eye (ophthalmoplegia) and drooping of the eyelids (ptosis). Some affected individuals also have general weakness of the skeletal muscles (myopathy), which may be especially noticeable during exercise. Muscle weakness may also cause difficulty swallowing (dysphagia). CPEO can be caused by mutations in any of several genes, which may be located in mitochondrial DNA or nuclear DNA. It has different inheritance patterns depending on the gene involved in the affected individual. CPEO can occur as part of other underlying conditions, such as ataxia neuropathy spectrum and Kearns-Sayre syndrome. These conditions may not only involve CPEO, but various additional features that are not shared by most individuals with CPEO.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia? The signs and symptoms of chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) typically begin in young adults between the ages of 18 and 40. The most common symptoms in affected individuals include drooping eyelids (ptosis) and weakness or paralysis of the eye muscles (ophthalmoplegia). The condition may be unilateral (affecting one eye) or bilateral (affecting both eyes). Some affected individuals also have weakness of the skeletal muscles (myopathy), specifically of the arms, legs, and/or neck. This may be especially noticeable during exercise. Muscle weakness may also cause difficulty swallowing (dysphagia). Sometimes, CPEO may be associated with other signs and symptoms. In these cases, the condition is referred to as \"progressive external ophthalmoplegia plus\" (PEO+). Additional signs and symptoms can include hearing loss caused by nerve damage in the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss), weakness and loss of sensation in the limbs due to nerve damage (neuropathy), impaired muscle coordination (ataxia), a pattern of movement abnormalities known as parkinsonism, or depression. CPEO can also occur as part of other underlying conditions such as Kearns-Sayre syndrome. These conditions may not only involve CPEO, but various additional features that are not shared by most individuals with CPEO.
