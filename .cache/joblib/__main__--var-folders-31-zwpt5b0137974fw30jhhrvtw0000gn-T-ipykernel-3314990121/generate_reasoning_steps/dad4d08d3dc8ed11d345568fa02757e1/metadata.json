Hereditary hearing loss conditions, in general, tend to be managed by a team that includes an otolaryngologist, an audiologist, a clinical geneticist, a pediatrician, sometimes an educator of the Deaf, a neurologist, and in case of branchiootorenal syndrome, a nephrologist (kidney doctor). Treatment of hearing loss may include determining which aids would be most helpful, for example hearing aids or vibrotactile devices; cochlear implantation may be considered in children over age 12 months with severe-to-profound hearing loss. Early hearing intervention through amplification, surgery, or cochlear implantation may be recommended for children who are at risk to lose their hearing before they learn to speak. People with hereditary hearing loss often require regular follow-up with a hearing specialist such as an audiologist to monitor stability or progression of the hearing loss. Treatment of branchial fistulae or cysts may require surgery. For people with branchiootorenal syndrome and severe kidney malformations or complications, dialysis or kidney transplant may be required.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Corneal dystrophy and perceptive deafness? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Corneal dystrophy and perceptive deafness. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Corneal dystrophy 90% Opacification of the corneal stroma 90% Sensorineural hearing impairment 90% Visual impairment 90% Nystagmus 50% Autosomal recessive inheritance - Hearing impairment - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Kimura disease is a rare, benign, chronic disorder that causes inflammation of tissue (nodules) under the skin of the head or neck.  These nodules tend to recur despite treatment. The cause of this condition is unknown, but may be due to an immune response.', 'How might Kimura disease be treated? For individuals with symptoms caused by Kimura disease, surgery to remove the nodules is the treatment of choice; however, the nodules often reappear after surgery. Steroids (such as prednisone), taken by mouth or via an injection in the skin, can shrink the nodules but rarely result in a cure. Other, less common, treatments include oral pentoxifylline, medication that supresses the immune system (such as cyclosporine), radiotherapy, and a combination of all trans-retinoic acid and prednisone. It is important to consult with your healthcare provider before taking any medication.']}"}, "time": 1746283456.732321}
