It makes hormones that help the body work normally. There are several types of cancer of the thyroid gland. You are at greater risk if you       - Are between ages 25 and 65    - Are a woman    - Are Asian    - Have a family member who has had thyroid disease    - Have had radiation treatments to your head or neck       You should see a doctor if you have a lump or swelling in your neck. Doctors use a physical exam, blood tests, imaging tests, and a biopsy to diagnose thyroid cancer. Treatment depends on the type of cancer you have and how far the cancer has spread. Many patients receive a combination of treatments. They may include surgery, radioactive iodine, hormone treatment, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells.    NIH: National Cancer Institute', 'Noroviruses are a group of related viruses. Infection with these viruses causes an illness called gastroenteritis, an inflammation of the stomach and intestines. It can spread from person to person, or through contaminated food or water. You can also get it if you touch a contaminated surface. Norovirus can be serious, especially for young children and older adults.    The most common symptoms of norovirus infection are       - Diarrhea    - Nausea and vomiting    - Stomach pain       Other symptoms may include fever, headache or body aches.    Treatment includes bed rest and lots of liquids to prevent dehydration. There is no specific medicine to treat norovirus infections.    Proper hand washing and safe food preparation may help prevent infections.    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (whooping cough) are serious bacterial infections. Tetanus causes painful tightening of the muscles, usually all over the body. It can lead to \"locking\" of the jaw. Diphtheria usually affects the nose and throat. Whooping cough causes uncontrollable coughing. Vaccines can protect you from these diseases. In the U.S., there are four combination vaccines:       - DTaP prevents all three diseases. It is for children younger than seven years old.    - Tdap also prevents all three. It is for older children and adults.    - DT prevents diphtheria and tetanus. It is for children younger than seven who cannot tolerate the pertussis vaccine.    - Td prevents diphtheria and tetanus. It is for older children and adults. It is usually given as a booster dose every 10 years. You may also get it earlier if you get a severe and dirty wound or burn.       Some people should not get these vaccines, including those who have had severe reactions to the shots before. Check with your doctor first if you have seizures, a neurologic problem, or Guillain-Barre syndrome. Also let your doctor know if you don\\'t feel well the day of the shot; you may need to postpone it.    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', \"Summary : Hospice care is end-of-life care. A team of health care professionals and volunteers provides it. They give medical, psychological, and spiritual support. The goal of the care is to help people who are dying have peace, comfort, and dignity. The caregivers try to control pain and other symptoms so a person can remain as alert and comfortable as possible. Hospice programs also provide services to support a patient's family.     Usually, a hospice patient is expected to live 6 months or less. Hospice care can take place       - At home    - At a hospice center    - In a hospital    - In a skilled nursing facility       NIH: National Cancer Institute\"]}"}, "time": 1746283467.1301}
