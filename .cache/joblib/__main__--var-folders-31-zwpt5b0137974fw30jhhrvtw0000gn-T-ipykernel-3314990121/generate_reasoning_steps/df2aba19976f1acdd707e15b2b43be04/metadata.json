There is currently no cure for lipoid proteinosis (LP) of Urbach and Wiethe. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. The skin abnormalities found in people affected by LP may be treated with certain medications, including corticosteriods, dimethyl sulfoxide; or d-penicillamine. An additional medication called acitretin can be used to treat hoarseness and some skin problems. Anticonvulsant medications are often prescribed for people with seizures. The success of these medications in treating the signs and symptoms of LP varies. Affected people with growths on their vocal cords or eyelids may be treated with carbon dioxide laser surgery. Dermabrasion (removal of the top layer of skin) may also improve the appearance of skin abnormalities.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Radio-ulnar synostosis type 2? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Radio-ulnar synostosis type 2. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal dominant inheritance - Dislocated radial head - Limited elbow extension - Radioulnar synostosis - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Deafness, autosomal dominant nonsyndromic sensorineural 22?

Signs and symptoms of TEMPI syndrome have appeared in mid-adulthood in all known affected individuals. The telangiectasias develop mostly on the face, trunk and arms. The intrapulmonary shunt causes hypoxia (not enough oxygen supply), which slowly progresses until the person needs continuous supplemental oxygen to support their breathing. Blood clots and bleeding in the brain have also been reported in some affected individuals. The cause of TEMPI syndrome is currently unknown. Treatment has reportedly been completely or partially successful with the medication bortezomib.']}"}, "time": 1746283456.8457222}
