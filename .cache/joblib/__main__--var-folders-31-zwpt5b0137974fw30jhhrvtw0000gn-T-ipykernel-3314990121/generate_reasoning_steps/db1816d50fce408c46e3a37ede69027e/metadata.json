Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'How is Fryns syndrome inherited? Although the exact cause of Fryns syndrome is not currently known (and no disease-causing gene has yet been identified), it is thought to be genetic because it tends to \"run in families\" and has features common to other genetic disorders. It appears to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that both copies of the disease-causing gene in each cell of the body (one copy inherited from each parent) have mutations. The parents of an affected individual are referred to as carriers, who typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier.', 'Michelin tire baby syndrome (MTBS) is a rare skin condition that consists of many, symmetrical skin folds found on the arms and legs of an affected individual at birth (congenital).  The skin folds do not cause any problems or impairments and usually disappear naturally as the child grows.  MTBS may be associated with other signs, such as unusual facial features or delays in development; these other features are different for each affected individual.  The exact cause of MTBS is unknown.  It has been suggested that MTBS might have a genetic cause, because there are reports of multiple affected members of the same family.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Michelin tire baby syndrome?
