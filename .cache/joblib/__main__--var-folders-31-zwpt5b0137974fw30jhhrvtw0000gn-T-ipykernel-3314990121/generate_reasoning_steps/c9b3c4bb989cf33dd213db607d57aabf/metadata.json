Congenital radio-ulnar synostosis is caused by abnormal development of the forearm bones in the fetal period, although the underlying cause of the developmental abnormality is not always known. The condition may be isolated (occur without other abnormalities) or it may be associated with various other skeletal, cardiac (heart), neurologic, or gastrointestinal abnormalities. When other abnormalities are present, the condition may be due to an underlying genetic cause, including a variety of syndromes or chromosome abnormalities. In some cases, congenital radio-ulnar synostosis appears to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. In an article published in 2000, the authors found that autosomal dominant radio-ulnar synostosis with amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia was caused by mutations in the HOXA11 gene in 2 families.', 'How is congenital radio-ulnar synostosis inherited? Congenital radio-ulnar synostosis appears to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner in some cases. This means that one mutated copy of the disease-causing gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. The mutated gene may occur for the first time in an affected individual, or it may be inherited from an affected parent. Each child of an individual with an autosomal dominant condition has a 50% (1 in 2) risk to inherit the mutated copy of the gene. Congenital radio-ulnar synostosis may also occur with a variety of other abnormalities and may be associated with a chromosome abnormality or genetic syndrome. In these cases, the inheritance pattern may depend upon that of the underlying genetic abnormality. Some genetic abnormalities that have been reported in association with this condition include Apert syndrome, Carpenter syndrome, arthrogryposis, Treacher Collins syndrome, Williams syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, and Holt-Oram syndrome. Congenital radio-ulnar synostosis may also occur sporadically as an isolated abnormality, in which case the cause may be unknown.', 'Calciphylaxis is a disease in which blood vessels (veins and arteries) become blocked by a build-up of calcium in the walls of the vessels, preventing blood from flowing to the skin or internal organs.  The lack of blood flow (ischemia) damages healthy tissue and causes it to die (necrosis).  The most obvious and frequent symptom of calciphylaxis is damage to the skin, as ulcers can develop and become infected easily.  Calciphylaxis can also affect fat tissue, internal organs, and skeletal muscle, causing infections, pain, and organ failure.  These symptoms are often irreversible, and many individuals with calciphylaxis may not survive more than a few months after they are diagnosed due to infection that spreads throughout the body (sepsis), or organ failure.  The exact cause of calciphylaxis is unknown.  Treatments may include medications to reduce pain, antibiotics to treat infections, and various approaches to preventing the development or worsening of this condition.', 'Chromosome 16q deletion is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is a missing (deleted) copy of genetic material on the long arm (q) of chromosome 16. The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the deletion and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with chromosome 16q deletion include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems and distinctive facial features. Chromosome testing of both parents can provide more information on whether or not the deletion was inherited. In most cases, parents do not have any chromosomal anomaly. However, sometimes one parent is found to have a balanced translocation, where a piece of a chromosome has broken off and attached to another one with no gain or loss of genetic material. The balanced translocation normally does not cause any signs or symptoms, but it increases the risk for having an affected child with a chromosomal anomaly like a deletion. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. This page is meant to provide general information about 16q deletions. You can contact GARD if you have questions about a specific deletion on chromosome 16.
