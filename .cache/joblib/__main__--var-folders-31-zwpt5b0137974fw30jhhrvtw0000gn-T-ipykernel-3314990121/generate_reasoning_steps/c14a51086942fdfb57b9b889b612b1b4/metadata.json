Although surgical removal of adult worms moving under the skin or across the eye can be done to relieve anxiety, loiasis is not cured by surgery alone. There are two medications that can be used to treat the infection and manage the symptoms. The treatment of choice is diethylcarbamazine (DEC), which kills the microfilariae and adult worms. Albendazole is sometimes used in patients who are not cured with multiple DEC treatments. It is thought to kill adult worms. Certain people with heavy infections are at risk of brain inflammation when treated with DEC. This can cause coma or sometimes death. People with heavy infections need to be treated by experienced specialists.  Sometimes, other medical conditions need to be addressed first in order to make it safer to use DEC. Sometimes treatment is not recommended.\\n    \\nMore on: Resources for Health Professionals: Treatment', \"There are no programs to control or eliminate loiasis in affected areas. Your risk of infection may be less in areas where communities receive regular treatment for onchocerciasis or lymphatic filariasis.\\n    \\nThere are no vaccines that protect you from loiasis. If you are going to be in an area with loiasis for a long period of time, diethylcarbamazine (DEC)\u2014300mg taken once a week\u2014can reduce your risk of infection. Avoiding areas where the deerflies are found, such as muddy, shaded areas along rivers or around wood fires, may also reduce your risk of infection. You may reduce your risk of bites by using insect repellants that contain DEET (N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide) and wearing long sleeves and long pants during the day, which is when deerflies bite. Treating your clothes with permethrin may also help. For a description of CDC's information for preventing insect bites, see CDC's Yellow Book.\\n    \\nMore on: Insect Bite Prevention\", 'The bacteria that cause nocardiosis are commonly found in soil and water.\\n    \\nYou could become sick with nocardiosis if:\\n    \\n     - You inhale (breathe in) the bacteria\\n     - Bacteria gets into an open wound or cut\\n    \\n    \\nIn rare cases, infection can occur during surgical procedures.\\n    \\nFortunately, nocardiosis is not spread person to person, so being around someone who has the disease will not make you sick.', 'People with very weak immune (body defense) systems are at risk for getting nocardiosis. \\n    \\nSeveral diseases and circumstances can cause the immune system to be weak.

Approximately 60% of nocardiosis cases are associated with pre-existing immune compromise. \\n    \\nIn addition, men have a greater risk of getting the infection than women; for every female who gets sick with nocardiosis, there are about 3 males who get the disease.']}"}, "time": 1746283483.874965}
