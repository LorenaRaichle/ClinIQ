Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\\n                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.\", 'Key Points\\n                    - Adult soft tissue sarcoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the soft tissues of the body.    - Having certain inherited disorders can increase the risk of adult soft tissue sarcoma.    - A sign of adult soft tissue sarcoma is a lump or swelling in soft tissue of the body.     - Adult soft tissue sarcoma is diagnosed with a biopsy.     - Certain factors affect treatment options and prognosis (chance of recovery).\\n                \\n                \\n                    Adult soft tissue sarcoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the soft tissues of the body.\\n                    The soft tissues of the body include the muscles, tendons (bands of fiber that connect muscles to bones), fat, blood vessels, lymph vessels, nerves, and tissues around joints. Adult soft tissue sarcomas can form almost anywhere in the body, but are most common in the head, neck, arms, legs, trunk, and abdomen.     There are many types of soft tissue sarcoma. The cells of each type of sarcoma look different under a microscope, based on the type of soft tissue in which the cancer began.    See the following PDQ summaries for more information on soft tissue sarcomas:         -  Childhood Soft Tissue Sarcoma Treatment     -  Ewing Sarcoma Family of Tumors Treatment     -  Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors Treatment     -  Kaposi Sarcoma Treatment     -  Uterine Sarcoma Treatment', \"Having certain inherited disorders can increase the risk of adult soft tissue sarcoma. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for soft tissue sarcoma include the following inherited disorders:         -  Retinoblastoma.    -  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1; von Recklinghausen disease).    -  Tuberous sclerosis (Bourneville disease).    -  Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP; Gardner syndrome).    -  Li-Fraumeni syndrome.    -  Werner syndrome (adult progeria).    -  Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (Gorlin syndrome).        Other risk factors for soft tissue sarcoma include the following:         - Past treatment with radiation therapy for certain cancers.    - Being exposed to certain chemicals, such as Thorotrast (thorium dioxide), vinyl chloride, or arsenic.    - Having swelling (lymphedema) in the arms or legs for a long time.\", 'A sign of adult soft tissue sarcoma is a lump or swelling in soft tissue of the body. A sarcoma may appear as a painless lump under the skin, often on an arm or a leg. Sarcomas that begin in the abdomen may not cause signs or symptoms until they get very big. As the sarcoma grows bigger and presses on nearby organs, nerves, muscles, or blood vessels, signs and symptoms may include:          - Pain.    - Trouble breathing.        Other conditions may cause the same signs and symptoms. Check with your doctor if you have any of these problems.']}"}, "time": 1746283465.297256}
