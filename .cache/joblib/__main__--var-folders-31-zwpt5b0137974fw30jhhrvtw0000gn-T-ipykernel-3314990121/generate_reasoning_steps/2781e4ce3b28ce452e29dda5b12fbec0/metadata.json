Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats andmeats.\\n                \\nSaturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5 percent to 6 percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples:\\n                \\n1,200 calories a day\\n                \\n8 grams of saturated fat a day\\n                \\n1,500 calories a day\\n                \\n10 grams of saturated fat a day\\n                \\n1,800 calories a day\\n                \\n12 grams of saturated fat a day\\n                \\n2,000 calories a day\\n                \\n13 grams of saturated fat a day\\n                \\n2,500 calories a day\\n                \\n17 grams of saturated fat a day\\n                \\nNot all fats are bad.

This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.\\n                \\nDietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension\\n                \\nYour doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt.\\n                \\nThe DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH.\\n                \\nAlcohol\\n                \\nTry to limit alcohol intake. Too much alcohol canraise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain.\\n                \\nMen should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is:\\n                \\n12 ounces of beer\\n                \\n5 ounces of wine\\n                \\n1 ounces of liquor\\n                \\nMaintaining a Healthy Weight\\n                \\nMaintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for coronary heart disease. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active.\\n                \\nKnowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBI) online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI:\\n                \\nBelow 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.\\n                \\nBetween 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range.\\n                \\nBetween 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight.\\n                \\nOf 30 or more is considered obese.\\n                \\nA general goal to aim for is a BMI below 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal.\\n                \\nMeasuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. This risk may be high with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk.\\n                \\nIf youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol.\\n                \\nManaging Stress\\n                \\nResearch shows that the most commonly reported trigger for a heart attack is an emotionally upsetting eventparticularly one involving anger. Also, some of the ways people cope with stresssuch as drinking, smoking, or overeatingarent healthy.\\n                \\nLearning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as:\\n                \\nA stress management program\\n                \\nMeditation\\n                \\nPhysical activity\\n                \\nRelaxation therapy\\n                \\nTalking things out with friends or family\\n                \\nPhysical Activity\\n                \\nRoutine physical activity can lower many coronary heart disease risk factors, including LDL (bad) cholesterol, high blood pressure, and excess weight. Physical activity also can lower your risk for diabetes and raise your HDL cholesterol level. HDL is the good cholesterol that helps prevent coronary heart disease.\\n                \\nEveryone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week, or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1hour and 15minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10minutes at a time spread throughout the week.\\n                \\nRead more about physical activity at:\\n                \\nPhysical Activity and Your Heart\\n                \\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines forAmericans\\n                \\nTalk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.\\n                \\nQuitting Smoking\\n                \\nIf you smoke, quit. Smoking can raise your risk for coronary heart disease and heart attack and worsen other coronary heart disease risk factors. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.\\n                \\nIf you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.\\n                \\nRead more about quitting smoking at Smoking and Your Heart.\\n                \\nOngoing Medical Care\\n                \\nLearn more about heart disease and the traits, conditions, and habits that can raise your risk for developing it. Talk with your doctor about your risk factors for heart disease and how to controlthem.\\n                \\nIf lifestyle changes arent enough, your doctor may prescribe medicines to control your risk factors. Take all of your medicines as your doctor advises. Visit your doctor regularly and have recommended testing.\\n                \\nKnow your numbers. Ask your doctor for these three tests and have the results explained toyou:\\n                \\nBlood pressure measurement.\\n                \\nFasting blood glucose. This test is for diabetes.\\n                \\nLipoprotein panel. This test measures total cholesterol, LDL (bad) cholesterol, HDL (good) cholesterol, and triglycerides (a type of fat in the blood).\\n                \\nFinally, know your family history of heart disease. If you or someone in your family has heart disease, tell your doctor.', 'The term \"diabetic heart disease\" (DHD) refers to heart disease that develops in people who have diabetes. Compared with people who don\\'t have diabetes, people who have diabetes:\\n                \\nAre at higher risk for heart disease\\n                \\nHave additional causes of heart disease\\n                \\nMay develop heart disease at a younger age\\n                \\nMay have more severe heart disease\\n                \\nWhat Is Diabetes?\\n                \\nDiabetes is a disease in which the body\\'s blood glucose (sugar) level is too high. Normally, the body breaks down food into glucose and carries it to cells throughout the body. The cells use a hormone called insulin to turn the glucose into energy.\\n                \\nThe two main types of diabetes are type 1 and type 2. In type 1 diabetes, the body doesn\\'t make enough insulin. This causes the body\\'s blood sugar level to rise.\\n                \\nIn type 2 diabetes, the body\\'s cells don\\'t use insulin properly (a condition called insulin resistance). At first, the body reacts by making more insulin. Over time, though, the body can\\'t make enough insulin to control its blood sugar level.\\n                \\nFor more information about diabetes, go to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\\' Introduction to Diabetes Web page.\\n                \\nWhat Heart Diseases Are Involved in Diabetic Heart Disease?\\n                \\nDHD may include coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure, and/or diabetic cardiomyopathy (KAR-de-o-mi-OP-ah-thee).\\n                \\nCoronary Heart Disease\\n                \\nIn CHD, a waxy substance called plaque (plak) builds up inside the coronary arteries. These arteries supply your heart muscle with oxygen-rich blood.\\n                \\nPlaque is made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. When plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis (ATH-er-o-skler-O-sis).\\n                \\nPlaque narrows the coronary arteries and reduces blood flow to your heart muscle. The buildup of plaque also makes it more likely that blood clots will form in your arteries. Blood clots can partially or completely block blood flow.\\n                \\nCHD can lead to chest pain or discomfort called angina (an-JI-nuh or AN-juh-nuh), irregular heartbeats called arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs), a heart attack, or even death.\\n                \\nHeart Failure\\n                \\nHeart failure is a condition in which your heart can\\'t pump enough blood to meet your body\\'s needs. The term heart failure doesn\\'t mean that your heart has stopped or is about to stop working. However, heart failure is a serious condition that requires medical care.\\n                \\nIf you have heart failure, you may tire easily and have to limit your activities. CHD can lead to heart failure by weakening the heart muscle over time.\\n                \\nDiabetic Cardiomyopathy\\n                \\nDiabetic cardiomyopathy is a disease that damages the structure and function of the heart. This disease can lead to heart failure and arrhythmias, even in people who have diabetes but don\\'t have CHD.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nPeople who have type 1 or type 2 diabetes can develop DHD. The higher a person\\'s blood sugar level is, the higher his or her risk of DHD.\\n                \\nDiabetes affects heart disease risk in three major ways.\\n                \\nFirst, diabetes alone is a very serious risk factor for heart disease, just like smoking, high blood pressure, and high blood cholesterol. In fact, people who have type 2 diabetes have the same risk of heart attack and dying from heart disease as people who already have had heart attacks.\\n                \\nSecond, when combined with other risk factors, diabetes further raises the risk of heart disease. Although research is ongoing, it\\'s clear that diabetes and other conditionssuch as overweight and obesity and metabolic syndromeinteract to cause harmful physical changes to the heart.\\n                \\nThird, diabetes raises the risk of earlier and more severe heart problems. Also, people who have DHD tend to have less success with some heart disease treatments, such as coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous coronary intervention,also known as coronary angioplasty.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nIf you have diabetes, you can lower your risk of DHD. Making lifestyle changes and taking prescribed medicines can help you prevent or control many risk factors.\\n                \\nTaking action to manage multiple risk factors helps improve your outlook. The good news is that many lifestyle changes help control multiple risk factors. For example, physical activity can lower your blood pressure, help control your blood sugar level and your weight, and reduce stress.\\n                \\nIt\\'s also very important to follow your treatment plan for diabetes and see your doctor for ongoing care.\\n                \\nIf you already have DHD, follow your treatment plan as your doctors advises. This may help you avoid or delay serious problems, such as a heart attack or heart failure.', 'At least four complex processes, alone or combined, can lead to diabetic heart disease (DHD). They include coronary atherosclerosis; metabolic syndrome; insulin resistance in people who have type 2 diabetes; and the interaction of coronary heart disease (CHD), high blood pressure, and diabetes.\\n                \\nResearchers continue to study these processes because all of the details aren\\'t yet known.\\n                \\nCoronary Atherosclerosis\\n                \\nAtherosclerosis is a disease in which plaque builds up inside the arteries. The exact cause of atherosclerosis isn\\'t known. However, studies show that it is a slow, complex disease that may start in childhood. The disease develops faster as you age.\\n                \\nCoronary atherosclerosis may start when certain factors damage the inner layers of the coronary (heart) arteries. These factors include:\\n                \\nSmoking\\n                \\nHigh amounts of certain fats and cholesterol in the blood\\n                \\nHigh blood pressure\\n                \\nHigh amounts of sugar in the blood due to insulin resistance or diabetes\\n                \\nPlaque may begin to build up where the arteries are damaged. Over time, plaque hardens and narrows the arteries. This reduces the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle.\\n                \\nEventually, an area of plaque can rupture (break open). When this happens, blood cell fragments called platelets (PLATE-lets) stick to the site of the injury. They may clump together to form blood clots.\\n                \\nBlood clots narrow the coronary arteries even more. This limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart and may worsen angina (chest pain) or cause a heart attack.\\n                \\nMetabolic Syndrome\\n                \\nMetabolic syndrome is the name for a group of risk factors that raises your risk of both CHD and type 2 diabetes.\\n                \\nIf you have three or more of the five metabolic risk factors, you have metabolic syndrome. The risk factors are:\\n                \\nA large waistline (a waist measurement of 35 inches or more for women and 40 inches or more for men).\\n                \\nA high triglyceride (tri-GLIH-seh-ride) level (or youre on medicine to treat high triglycerides). Triglycerides are a type of fat found in the blood.\\n                \\nA low HDL cholesterol level (or you\\'re on medicine to treat low HDL cholesterol). HDL sometimes is called \"good\" cholesterol. This is because it helps remove cholesterol from your arteries.\\n                \\nHigh blood pressure (or youre on medicine to treat high blood pressure).\\n                \\nA high fasting blood sugar level (or you\\'re on medicine to treat high blood sugar).\\n                \\nIt\\'s unclear whether these risk factors have a common cause or are mainly related by their combined effects on the heart.\\n                \\nObesity seems to set the stage for metabolic syndrome. Obesity can cause harmful changes in body fats and how the body uses insulin.\\n                \\nChronic (ongoing) inflammation also may occur in people who have metabolic syndrome. Inflammation is the body\\'s response to illness or injury. It may raise your risk of CHD and heart attack. Inflammation also may contribute to or worsen metabolic syndrome.\\n                \\nResearch is ongoing to learn more about metabolic syndrome and how metabolic risk factors interact.\\n                \\nInsulin Resistance in People Who Have Type 2 Diabetes\\n                \\nType 2 diabetes usually begins with insulin resistance. Insulin resistance means that the body can\\'t properly use the insulin it makes.\\n                \\nPeople who have type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance have higher levels of substances in the blood that cause blood clots. Blood clots can block the coronary arteries and cause a heart attack or even death.\\n                \\nThe Interaction of Coronary Heart Disease, High Blood Pressure, and Diabetes\\n                \\nEach of these risk factors alone can damage the heart. CHD reduces the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle. High blood pressure and diabetes may cause harmful changes in the structure and function of the heart.\\n                \\nHaving CHD, high blood pressure, and diabetes is even more harmful to the heart. Together, these conditions can severely damage the heart muscle. As a result, the heart has to work harder than normal. Over time, the heart weakens and isnt able to pump enough blood to meet the bodys needs. This condition is called heart failure.\\n                \\nAs the heart weakens, the body may release proteins and other substances into the blood. These proteins and substances also can harm the heart and worsen heart failure.']}"}, "time": 1746283466.415997}
