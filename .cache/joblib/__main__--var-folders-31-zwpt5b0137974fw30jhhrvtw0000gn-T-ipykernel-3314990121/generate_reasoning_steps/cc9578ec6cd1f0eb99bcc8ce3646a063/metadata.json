Treatment may include\\n                \\n- nutritional support  - medications  - surgery  - intestinal transplant\\n                \\nNutritional Support\\n                \\nThe main treatment for short bowel syndrome is nutritional support, which may include the following:\\n                \\n- Oral rehydration. Adults should drink water, sports drinks, sodas without caffeine, and salty broths. Children should drink oral rehydration solutionsspecial drinks that contain salts and minerals to prevent dehydrationsuch as Pedialyte, Naturalyte, Infalyte, and CeraLyte, which are sold in most grocery stores and drugstores.  - Parenteral nutrition. This treatment delivers fluids, electrolytes, and liquid vitamins and minerals into the bloodstream through an intravenous (IV) tubea tube placed into a vein. Health care providers give parenteral nutrition to people who cannot or should not get their nutrition or enough fluids through eating.  - Enteral nutrition. This treatment delivers liquid food to the stomach or small intestine through a feeding tubea small, soft, plastic tube placed through the nose or mouth into the stomach. Gallstonessmall, pebblelike substances that develop in the gallbladderare a complication of enteral nutrition. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Gallstones.  - Vitamin and mineral supplements. A person may need to take vitamin and mineral supplements during or after parenteral or enteral nutrition.  - Special diet. A health care provider can recommend a specific diet plan for the patient that may include      - small, frequent feedings    - avoiding foods that can cause diarrhea, such as foods high in sugar, protein, and fiber    - avoiding high-fat foods\\n                \\nMedications\\n                \\nA health care provider may prescribe medications to treat short bowel syndrome, including\\n                \\n- antibiotics to prevent bacterial overgrowth  - H2 blockers to treat too much gastric acid secretion  - proton pump inhibitors to treat too much gastric acid secretion  - choleretic agents to improve bile flow and prevent liver disease  - bile-salt binders to decrease diarrhea  - anti-secretin agents to reduce gastric acid in the intestine  - hypomotility agents to increase the time it takes food to travel through the intestines, leading to increased nutrient absorption  - growth hormones to improve intestinal absorption  - teduglutide to improve intestinal absorption\\n                \\nSurgery\\n                \\nThe goal of surgery is to increase the small intestine's ability to absorb nutrients. Approximately half of the patients with short bowel syndrome need surgery.2 Surgery used to treat short bowel syndrome includes procedures that\\n                \\n- prevent blockage and preserve the length of the small intestine  - narrow any dilated segment of the small intestine  - slow the time it takes for food to travel through the small intestine  - lengthen the small intestine\\n                \\nLong-term treatment and recovery, which for some may take years, depend in part on\\n                \\n- what sections of the small intestine were removed  - how much of the intestine is damaged  - how well the muscles of the intestine work  - how well the remaining small intestine adapts over time\\n                \\nIntestinal Transplant\\n                \\nAn intestinal transplant is surgery to remove a diseased or an injured small intestine and replace it with a healthy small intestine from a person who has just died, called a donor. Sometimes a living donor can provide a segment of his or her small intestine.\\n                \\nTransplant surgeonsdoctors who specialize in performing transplant surgeryperform the surgery on patients for whom other treatments have failed and who have lifethreatening complications from long-term parenteral nutrition. An intestinal-transplant team performs the surgery in a hospital. The patient will need anesthesia. Complications of intestinal transplantation include infections and rejection of the transplanted organ.\\n                \\nA successful intestinal transplant can be a life-saving treatment for people with intestinal failure caused by short bowel syndrome. By 2008, transplant surgeons had performed almost 2,000 intestinal transplantations in the United Statesapproximately 75 percent of which were in patients younger than 18 years of age.3\\n                \\nA health care provider will tailor treatment to the severity of the patient's disease:   - Treatment for mild short bowel syndrome involves eating small, frequent meals; drinking fluid; taking nutritional supplements; and using medications to treat diarrhea.   - Treatment for moderate short bowel syndrome is similar to that for mild short bowel syndrome, with the addition of parenteral nutrition as needed.   - Treatment for severe short bowel syndrome involves use of parenteral nutrition and oral rehydration solutions. Patients may receive enteral nutrition or continue normal eating, even though most of the nutrients are not absorbed. Both enteral nutrition and normal eating stimulate the remaining intestine to work better and may allow patients to discontinue parenteral nutrition. Some patients with severe short bowel syndrome require parenteral nutrition indefinitely or surgery.\", 'People can ask their health care providers about surgical techniques that minimize scar tissue. Scientists have not yet found a way to prevent short bowel syndrome that is present at birth, as its cause is unknown.', 'Intestinal adaptation is a process that usually occurs in children after removal of a large portion of their small intestine. The remaining small intestine goes through a period of adaptation and grows to increase its ability to absorb nutrients. Intestinal adaptation can take up to 2 years to occur, and during this time a person may be heavily dependent on parenteral or enteral nutrition.1', 'Researchers have not found that eating, diet, and nutrition play a role in causing or preventing short bowel syndrome.']}"}, "time": 1746283485.105812}
