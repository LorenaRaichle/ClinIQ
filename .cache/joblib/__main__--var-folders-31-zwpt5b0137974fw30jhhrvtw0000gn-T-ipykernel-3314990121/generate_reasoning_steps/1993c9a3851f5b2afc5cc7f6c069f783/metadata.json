Yes. Genetic testing is available for MTHFR gene mutations. This testing can be used in people with suspected homocystinuria or to determine the cause of elevated homocysteine levels in the blood. Genetic testing for C677T and A1286C may be indicated in a person with elevated homocysteine levels and one or more of the following, coronary artery disease venous thromboembolism stroke heart attack peripheral artery disease aneurysm high blood pressure recurrent pregnancy loss However, the American Heart Association recommends against testing for the common MTHFR gene mutations (C677T and A1298C) as a screen for increased risk of cardiovascular conditions. The College of American Pathologists and the American College of Medical Genetics recommend against testing for C677T and A1298C in people with blood clots. This is because the relationship between C677T and A1298C mutations and risk for cardiovascular disease is not completely understood. The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) is a centralized online resource for information about genetic tests. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional.', 'How might a MTHFR gene mutation be treated? High homocysteine levels in the body may occur if the MTHFR enzyme is not functioning normally due to MTHFR mutations, such as C677T and A1298C. Currently there are no treatments to remove adverse risks associated with MTHFR gene mutations. However, elevated levels of homocysteine can also occur if there is a lack of folate or B vitamins. Homocysteine levels also tend to rise with age, smoking, and use of certain drugs (such as carbamazepine, methotrexate, and phenytoin). It is important to ensure that people with and without MTHFR gene mutations receive adequate amounts of naturally occurring folate, choline, and B vitamins (B12, B6, and riboflavin) to mitigate nutritional risks. If adequate nutrition cannot be attained through diet alone, supplementation with folate (e.g., levomefolate (5-methyl THF) or folinic acid) and B vitamins is considered. We recommend that you talk to your doctor to learn if supplementation would benefit you. Smoking cessation and, when possible, avoidance of medications that adversely affect homocystiene level are additional management strategies.', 'Lipedema is a syndrome characterized by symmetric enlargement of the legs due to deposits of fat beneath the skin, which is often painful.  It is a common condition affecting up to 11% of women  The underlying cause is currently unknown; however many people with lipedema have a family history of similarly enlarged legs. Hormones are also thought to play a role.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of lipedema? Signs and symptoms of lipedema include enlarged legs extending from the buttocks to the ankles. This enlargement can be painful. The size of the legs are typically out of proportion to the upper body (despite the individuals BMI). The feet are much less involved or spared entirely. In lipedema, the skin does not appear warty, hard (sclerotic), or discolored. Lipedema is not thought to predispose a person to ulcer development. People with lipedema may tend to bruise easily, possibly due to increased fragility of small blood vessel within the fat tissue.']}"}, "time": 1746283457.354166}
