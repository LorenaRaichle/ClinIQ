Less than 40 cases have been reported in the literature, mostly as single case reports or small series. Early death is common due to respiratory complications. The cause of this disease remains unknown, but its sporadic occurrence suggests a de novo (new) dominant mutation. Aggressive management of the early respiratory and feeding problems may improve survival in individuals affected by this condition.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Marshall-Smith syndrome? Marshall-Smith syndrome is characterized by accelerated skeletal maturation, relative failure to thrive, respiratory difficulties, mental retardation, and unusual facies, including wide and prominent forehead, protruding and widely spaced eyes, blue sclerae (the white part of the eye), depressed nasal bridge, a small, upturned nose, and micrognathia. There are often problems with structures in the respiratory tract (such as the larynx and trachea) and this can lead to difficulty with breathing and frequent infections. Pneumonia is common. Severe feeding difficulties may also result. X-rays show advanced bone age and short and conical phalanges (finger and/or toes bones). The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Marshall-Smith syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Dyskeratosis congenita autosomal dominant?
