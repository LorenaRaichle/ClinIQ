The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Bare lymphocyte syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition.

Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal recessive inheritance - Bronchiectasis - Bronchiolitis - Chronic otitis media - Chronic sinusitis - Ectopia lentis - Emphysema - Recurrent bronchitis - Skin ulcer - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Premature aging Okamoto type?

Other signs and symptoms include intrauterine growth restriction, feeding difficulties, distinctive craniofacial features, hypotonia, developmental delay and mild to severe intellectual disability. In most cases, affected infants pass away before age 7 months, but rare reports exist of survival into the teens or early 20s. Although the exact underlying cause of neonatal progeroid syndrome is unknown, it is likely a genetic condition that is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Neonatal progeroid syndrome? The signs and symptoms of neonatal progeroid syndrome vary but may include: Subcutaneous lipoatrophy (deficiency or absence of the fat layer beneath the skin) which gives infants an aged appearance at birth Intrauterine growth restriction Failure to thrive Feeding difficulties Distinctive craniofacial features such as a triangular face; large skull with wide anterior (front) fontanelle; small, underdeveloped facial bones; natal teeth; low-set, posteriorly (towards the back) rotated ears, ectropion; and/or unusually sparse scalp hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes Thin arms and legs with disproportionately large hands and feet Small fingers and toes with underdeveloped nails Osteopenia (low bone density) Horizontal nystagmus Developmental delay Mild to severe intellectual disability The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Neonatal progeroid syndrome.
