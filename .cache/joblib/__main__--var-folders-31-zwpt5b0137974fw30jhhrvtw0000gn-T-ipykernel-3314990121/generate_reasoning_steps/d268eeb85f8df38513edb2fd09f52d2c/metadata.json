The affected joint may become swollen, red, or warm. Attacks usually occur at night. Sometime during the course of the disease, many patients will develop gout in the big toe. Other signs and symptoms of gout include - hyperuricemia -- high levels of uric acid in the body   - the presence of uric acid crystals in joint fluid   - more than one attack of acute arthritis  - arthritis that develops in a day, producing a swollen, red, and warm joint  - attack of arthritis in only one joint, often the toe, ankle, or knee. hyperuricemia -- high levels of uric acid in the body the presence of uric acid crystals in joint fluid more than one attack of acute arthritis arthritis that develops in a day, producing a swollen, red, and warm joint attack of arthritis in only one joint, often the toe, ankle, or knee.', 'To confirm a diagnosis of gout, the doctor inserts a needle into the inflamed joint and draws a sample of synovial fluid, the substance that lubricates a joint. A laboratory technician places some of the fluid on a slide and looks for uric acid crystals under a microscope. If uric acid crystals are found in the fluid surrounding the joint, the person usually has gout.', 'Physicians often prescribe high doses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or steroids for a sudden attack of gout. NSAIDs are taken by mouth and corticosteroids are either taken by mouth or injected into the affected joint. Patients often begin to improve within a few hours of treatment, and the attack usually goes away completely within a week or so. When NSAIDs or corticosteroids fail to control pain and swelling, the doctor may use another drug, colchicine. This drug is most effective when taken within the first 12 hours of an acute attack. For patients who have repeated gout attacks, the doctor may prescribe medicine such as allupurinol, febuxostat, or probenecid to lower uric acid levels. In severe cases of gout that do not respond to other treatments, pegloticase, a medicine administered by intravenous infusion, may be prescribed to reduce levels of uric acid.', 'The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) at NIH has more information about gout.
