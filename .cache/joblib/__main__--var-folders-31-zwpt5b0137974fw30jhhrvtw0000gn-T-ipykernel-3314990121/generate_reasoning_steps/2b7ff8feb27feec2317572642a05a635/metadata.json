Current treatment approaches focus on improving blood oxygen levels and providing supportive care. Doctors also will try to pinpoint and treat the underlying cause of the condition.\\n                \\nOxygen Therapy\\n                \\nOne of the main goals of treating ARDS is to provide oxygen to your lungs and other organs (such as your brain and kidneys). Your organs need oxygen to work properly.\\n                \\nOxygen usually is given through nasal prongs or a mask that fits over your mouth and nose. However, if your oxygen level doesn't rise or it's still hard for you to breathe, your doctor will give you oxygen through a breathing tube. He or she will insert the flexible tube through your mouth or nose and into your windpipe.\\n                \\nBefore inserting the tube, your doctor will squirt or spray a liquid medicine into your throat (and possibly your nose) to make it numb. Your doctor also will give you medicine through an intravenous (IV) line in your bloodstream to make you sleepy and relaxed.\\n                \\nThe breathing tube will be connected to a machine that supports breathing (a ventilator). The ventilator will fill your lungs with oxygen-rich air.\\n                \\nYour doctor will adjust the ventilator as needed to help your lungs get the right amount of oxygen. This also will help prevent injury to your lungs from the pressure of the ventilator.\\n                \\nYou'll use the breathing tube and ventilator until you can breathe on your own. If you need a ventilator for more than a few days, your doctor may do a tracheotomy (tra-ke-OT-o-me).\\n                \\nThis procedure involves making a small cut in your neck to create an opening to the windpipe. The opening is called a tracheostomy (TRA-ke-OS-to-me). Your doctor will place the breathing tube directly into the windpipe. The tube is then connected to the ventilator.\\n                \\nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Oxygen Therapy article.\\n                \\nSupportive Care\\n                \\nSupportive care refers to treatments that help relieve symptoms, prevent complications, or improve quality of life. Supportive approaches used to treat ARDS include:\\n                \\nMedicines to help you relax, relieve discomfort, and treat pain.\\n                \\nOngoing monitoring of heart and lung function (including blood pressure and gas exchange).\\n                \\nNutritional support. People who have ARDS often suffer from malnutrition. Thus, extra nutrition may be given through a feeding tube.\\n                \\nTreatment for infections. People who have ARDS are at higher risk for infections, such as pneumonia. Being on a ventilator also increases the risk of infections. Doctors use antibiotics to treat pneumonia and other infections.\\n                \\nPrevention of blood clots. Lying down for long periods can cause blood clots to form in the deep veins of your body. These clots can travel to your lungs and block blood flow (a condition called pulmonary embolism). Blood-thinning medicines and other treatments, such as compression stocking (stockings that create gentle pressure up the leg), are used to prevent blood clots.\\n                \\nPrevention of intestinal bleeding. People who receive long-term support from a ventilator are at increased risk of bleeding in the intestines. Medicines can reduce this risk.\\n                \\nFluids. You may be given fluids to improve blood flow through your body and to provide nutrition. Your doctor will make sure you get the right amount of fluids. Fluids usually are given through an IV line inserted into one of your blood vessels.\", 'Aplastic anemia (a-PLAS-tik uh-NEE-me-uh) is a blood disorder in which the body\\'s bone marrow doesn\\'t make enough new blood cells. Bone marrow is a sponge-like tissue inside the bones. It makes stem cells that develop into red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets (PLATE-lets).\\n                \\nRed blood cells carry oxygen to all parts of your body. They also carry carbon dioxide (a waste product) to your lungs to be exhaled. White blood cells help your body fight infections. Platelets are blood cell fragments that stick together to seal small cuts or breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding.\\n                \\nIt\\'s normal for blood cells to die. The lifespan of red blood cells is about 120 days. White blood cells live less than a day. Platelets live about 6 days. As a result, your bone marrow must constantly make new blood cells.\\n                \\nIf your bone marrow can\\'t make enough new blood cells, many health problems can occur. These problems include irregular heartbeats called arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs), an enlarged heart, heart failure, infections, and bleeding. Severe aplastic anemia can even cause death.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nAplastic anemia is a type of anemia. The term \"anemia\" usually refers to a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal number of red blood cells. Anemia also can occur if your red blood cells don\\'t contain enough hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin). This iron-rich protein helps carry oxygen to your body.\\n                \\nIn people who have aplastic anemia, the body doesn\\'t make enough red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. This is because the bone marrow\\'s stem cells are damaged. (Aplastic anemia also is called bone marrow failure.)\\n                \\nMany diseases, conditions, and factors can damage the stem cells. These conditions can be acquired or inherited. \"Acquired\" means you aren\\'t born with the condition, but you develop it. \"Inherited\" means your parents passed the gene for the condition on to you.\\n                \\nIn many people who have aplastic anemia, the cause is unknown.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nAplastic anemia is a rare but serious disorder. It can develop suddenly or slowly. The disorder tends to get worse over time, unless its cause is found and treated. Treatments for aplastic anemia include blood transfusions, blood and marrow stem cell transplants, and medicines.\\n                \\nWith prompt and proper care, many people who have aplastic anemia can be successfully treated. Blood and marrow stem cell transplants may offer a cure for some people who have aplastic anemia.', 'Damage to the bone marrow\\'s stem cells causes aplastic anemia. When stem cells are damaged, they don\\'t grow into healthy blood cells.\\n                \\nThe cause of the damage can be acquired or inherited. \"Acquired\" means you aren\\'t born with the condition, but you develop it. \"Inherited\" means your parents passed the gene for the condition on to you.\\n                \\nAcquired aplastic anemia is more common, and sometimes it\\'s only temporary. Inherited aplastic anemia is rare.\\n                \\nIn many people who have aplastic anemia, the cause is unknown. Some research suggests that stem cell damage may occur because the body\\'s immune system attacks its own cells by mistake.\\n                \\nAcquired Causes\\n                \\nMany diseases, conditions, and factors can cause aplastic anemia, including:\\n                \\nToxins, such as pesticides, arsenic, and benzene.\\n                \\nRadiation and chemotherapy (treatments for cancer).\\n                \\nMedicines, such as chloramphenicol (an antibiotic rarely used in the United States).\\n                \\nInfectious diseases, such as hepatitis, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus (si-to-MEG-ah-lo-VI-rus), parvovirus B19, and HIV.\\n                \\nAutoimmune disorders, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.\\n                \\nPregnancy. (Aplastic anemia that occurs during pregnancy often goes away after delivery.)\\n                \\nSometimes, cancer from another part of the body can spread to the bone and cause aplastic anemia.\\n                \\nInherited Causes\\n                \\nCertain inherited conditions can damage the stem cells and lead to aplastic anemia. Examples include Fanconi anemia, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, dyskeratosis (DIS-ker-ah-TO-sis) congenita, and Diamond-Blackfan anemia.', 'Aplastic anemia is a rare but serious blood disorder. People of all ages can develop aplastic anemia. However, it\\'s most common in adolescents, young adults, and the elderly.
