The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Naegeli syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of dental enamel 90% Abnormality of the fingernails 90% Abnormality of the toenails 90% Irregular hyperpigmentation 90% Palmoplantar keratoderma 90% Autosomal dominant inheritance - Carious teeth - Fragile nails - Heat intolerance - Hypohidrosis - Premature loss of teeth - Reticular hyperpigmentation - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'How is Naegeli syndrome diagnosed? In most cases of Naegeli syndrome, a diagnosis is made based on the typical clinical features of this condition. The clinical diagnosis may be confirmed by genetic testing of the KRT14 gene.  GeneTests lists a laboratory that performs genetic testing of the KRT14 gene. If you are interested in genetic testing for this condition, we recommend that you consult with a genetics professional.', \"Is there a treatment for Naegeli syndrome? Treatment for Naegeli syndrome is based on an individual's symptoms. Dry skin can be moisturized with creams. To avoid overheating, affected individuals should wear appropriate clothing and use wet dressings. Dental care is needed treat cavities and tooth loss.\", 'Hemoglobin E (HbE) disease is an inherited blood disorder characterized by an abnormal form of hemoglobin, called hemoglobin E. People with this condition have red blood cells that are smaller than normal and have an irregular shape. HbE disease is thought to be a benign condition. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and is caused by a particular mutation in the HBB gene. The mutation that causes hemoglobin E disease has the highest frequency among people of Southeast Asian heritage (Cambodian, Laotian, Vietnamese and Thai). However, it is also found in people of Chinese, Filipino, Asiatic Indian, and Turkish descent.']}"}, "time": 1746283455.968925}
