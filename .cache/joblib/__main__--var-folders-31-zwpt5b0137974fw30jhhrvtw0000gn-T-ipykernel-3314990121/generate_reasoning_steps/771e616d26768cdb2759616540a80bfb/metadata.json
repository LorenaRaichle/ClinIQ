The National Kidney Disease Education Program recommends the following:\\n                \\n- urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio measured at least once a year in all people with type 2 diabetes and people who have had type 1 diabetes for 5 years or more  - eGFR calculated at least once a year in all people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes', 'People can prevent or slow the progression of diabetic kidney disease by\\n                \\n- taking medications to control high blood pressure  - managing blood glucose levels  - making changes in their eating, diet, and nutrition  - losing weight if they are overweight or obese  - getting regular physical activity\\n                \\nPeople with diabetes should see a health care provider who will help them learn to manage their diabetes and monitor their diabetes control. Most people with diabetes get care from primary care providers, including internists, family practice doctors, or pediatricians. However, having a team of health care providers can often improve diabetes care. In addition to a primary care provider, the team can include\\n                \\n- an endocrinologista doctor with special training in diabetes  - a nephrologista doctor who specializes in treating people who have kidney problems or related conditions  - diabetes educators such as a nurse or dietitian  - a podiatrista doctor who specializes in foot care  - an ophthalmologist or optometrist for eye care  - a pharmacist  - a dentist  - a mental health counselor for emotional support and access to community resources\\n                \\nThe team can also include other health care providers and specialists.\\n                \\nBlood Pressure Medications\\n                \\nMedications that lower blood pressure can also significantly slow the progression of kidney disease. Two types of blood pressure-lowering medications, angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), have been shown to slow the progression of kidney disease. Many people require two or more medications to control their blood pressure. In addition to an ACE inhibitor or an ARB, a health care provider may prescribe a diuretica medication that helps the kidneys remove fluid from the blood. A person may also need beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and other blood pressure medications.\\n                \\nPeople should talk with their health care provider about their individual blood pressure goals and how often they should have their blood pressure checked.\\n                \\nManaging Blood Glucose Levels\\n                \\nPeople manage blood glucose levels by\\n                \\n- testing blood glucose throughout the day  - following a diet and physical activity plan  - taking insulin throughout the day based on food and liquid intake and physical activity\\n                \\nPeople with diabetes need to talk with their health care team regularly and follow their directions closely. The goal is to keep blood glucose levels within the normal range or within a range set by the persons health care team.

A health care provider may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan. DASH focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and lower in sodium, which often comes from salt. The DASH eating plan\\n                \\n- is low in fat and cholesterol  - features fat-free or low-fat milk and dairy products, fish, poultry, and nuts  - suggests less red meat, and fewer sweets, added sugars, and sugarcontaining beverages  - is rich in nutrients, protein, and fiber\\n                \\nRead more about DASH at www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/dash.\\n                \\nPeople with diabetic kidney disease may need to limit sodium and salt intake to help reduce edema and lower blood pressure. A dietitian may also recommend a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol to help control high levels of lipids, or fats, in the blood.\\n                \\nHealth care providers may recommend that people with CKD eat moderate or reduced amounts of protein, though the benefits of reducing protein in a persons diet are still being researched. Proteins break down into waste products the kidneys must filter from the blood. Eating more protein than the body needs may burden the kidneys and cause kidney function to decline faster. However, protein intake that is too low may lead to malnutrition, a condition that occurs when the body does not get enough nutrients.

Overweight is defined as a body mass index (BMI)a measurement of weight in relation to heightof 25 to 29. A BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese. People should aim to keep their BMI lower than 25.4\\n                \\nExperts recommend physical activity as an important part of losing weight, keeping sensitivity to insulin, and treating high blood pressure. Most people should try to get at least 30 to 60 minutes of activity most or all days of the week. A person can do all physical activity at once or break up activities into shorter periods of at least 10 minutes each. Moderate activities include brisk walking, dancing, bowling, riding a bike, working in a garden, and cleaning the house.

In some cases, people with diabetic kidney disease receive kidney and pancreas transplants.\\n                \\nIn most cases, people with diabetic kidney disease start dialysis earlier than people with kidney failure who do not have diabetes. People with diabetic end-stage kidney disease who receive a kidney transplant have a much better survival rate than those people on dialysis, although survival rates for those on dialysis have increasingly improved over time. However, people who receive a kidney transplant and do not have diabetes have a higher survival rate than people with diabetic kidney disease who receive a transplant.5\\n                \\nMore information about treatment options for kidney failure is provided in the NIDDK health topics:\\n                \\n- Treatment Methods for Kidney Failure: Hemodialysis  - Treatment Methods for Kidney Failure: Peritoneal Dialysis  - Treatment Methods for Kidney Failure: Transplantation', 'People with diabetes should work with their health care team to prevent or manage CKD through the following steps:\\n                \\n- measure A1C levelsa blood test that provides information about a persons average blood glucose levels for the previous 3 months at least twice a year and keep A1C levels below 7 percent  - learn about insulin injections, diabetes medications, meal planning, physical activity, and blood glucose monitoring  - find out whether protein, salt, or liquid should be limited in the diet  - see a registered dietitian to help with meal planning  - check blood pressure every visit with a health care provider or at least two to four times a year  - learn about possible benefits from taking an ACE inhibitor or an ARB if a person has high blood pressure  - measure eGFR at least once a year to check kidney function  - get the amount of protein in the urine tested at least once a year to check for kidney damage']}"}, "time": 1746283485.654739}
