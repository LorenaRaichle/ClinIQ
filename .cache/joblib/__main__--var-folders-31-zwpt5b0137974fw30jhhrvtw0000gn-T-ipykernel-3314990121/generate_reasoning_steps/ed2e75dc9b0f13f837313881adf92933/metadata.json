It is characterized by oval or irregularly shaped brown to gray-brown macules and patches on the skin. Areas that are exposed to sun such as the forehead, temples and neck are most commonly affected. However, the macules and patches may also develop on the trunk or in places where two areas of skin touch or rub together (i.e. the armpit, groin, etc). LPP is a chronic, relapsing condition with periods of exacerbations (worsening symptoms) separated by periods of remission (a decrease in or disappearance of symptoms). Although the exact underlying cause of LPP is unknown, studies suggest that UV light, viral infections, and certain topical (applied to the skin) agents such as mustard oil and amla oil, may trigger the condition. Treatment for LPP is symptomatic.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of lichen planus pigmentosus?

Although the skin findings of LPP are usually not associated with any additional symptoms, some affected people may experience mild itching and/or burning or develop other features of lichen planus.

LPP usually affects young to middle-aged adults who have dark skin, especially those of Indian, Latin American, and the Middle Eastern descent.', 'What causes lichen planus pigmentosus? The exact underlying cause of lichen planus pigmentosus is currently unknown. However, studies suggest that the condition may be triggered by viral infections, UV light or the application of certain oils on the hair or skin (i.e. mustard oil, amla oil).', 'How is lichen planus pigmentosus diagnosed? A diagnosis of lichen planus pigmentosus is usually suspected based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms. A skin biopsy may then be ordered to confirm the diagnosis.']}"}, "time": 1746283458.0136042}
