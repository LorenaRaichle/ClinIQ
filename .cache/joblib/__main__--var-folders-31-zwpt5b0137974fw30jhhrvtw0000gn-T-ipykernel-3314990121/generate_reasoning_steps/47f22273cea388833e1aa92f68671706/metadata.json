The most well known retinoid is isotretinoin (Accutane), a drug used to treat severe cystic acne. Birth defects associated with fetal retinoid syndrome include: hydrocephalus, microcephaly, intellectual disabilities, ear and eye abnormalities, cleft palate and other facial differences, and heart defects. Isotretinoin can cause these birth defects in the early weeks of pregnancy, even before a woman knows that she is pregnant.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Richieri Costa Da Silva syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Richieri Costa Da Silva syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Absent tibia - Autosomal recessive inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Lymphocytic infiltrate of Jessner is a skin condition characterized by single or multiple small, nonscaly, red, bumps on the face, neck, and upper back. The bumps can enlarge to create a red plaque. Rarely, the skin lesions cause burning or itching. The condition tends to last for several months, sometimes longer. The lesions may fluctuate between periods of worsening and periods of improvement. Currently, the cause is not known.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Lymphocytic infiltrate of Jessner?
