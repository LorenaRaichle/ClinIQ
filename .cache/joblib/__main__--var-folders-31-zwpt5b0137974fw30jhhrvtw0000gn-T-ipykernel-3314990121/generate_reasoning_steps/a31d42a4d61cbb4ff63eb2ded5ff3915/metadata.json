People with any kind of kidney disease, including PKD, should talk with a dietitian about foods that should be added to their diet and foods that might be harmful.\\n                \\nPKD may require diet changes for blood pressure control. Kidney disease in general also calls for certain diet changes.\\n                \\nFollowing a healthy eating plan can help lower blood pressure. A health care provider may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan, which focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and lower in sodium, which often comes from salt. The DASH eating plan\\n                \\n- is low in fat and cholesterol  - features fat-free or low-fat milk and dairy products, fish, poultry, and nuts  - suggests less red meat, sweets, added sugars, and sugar-containing beverages  - is rich in nutrients, protein, and fiber\\n                \\nMore information about the DASH eating planis available from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.\\n                \\nAs your kidneys become more damaged, you may need to eat foods that are lower in phosphorus and potassium. The health care provider will use lab tests to watch your levels.\\n                \\nFoods high in potassium include\\n                \\n- bananas  - oranges  - potatoes  - tomatoes\\n                \\nLower-potassium foods include\\n                \\n- apples  - peaches  - carrots  - green beans\\n                \\nFoods higher in phosphorus include\\n                \\n- large portions of meat, fish and dairy foods  - bran cereals and oatmeal  - beans and nuts  - colas\\n                \\nLower-phosphorus alternatives include\\n                \\n- fresh fruits and vegetables  - breads  - pasta  - rice  - corn and rice cereals  - light-colored sodas\\n                \\nPeople with kidney disease and high blood pressure should also limit how much sodium they get to 2,300 mg or less each day.5\\n                \\nPeople with CKD may need to watch how much protein they eat. Everyone needs protein. However, protein breaks down into wastes the kidneys must remove. Large amounts of protein make the kidneys work harder. High-quality proteins such as meat, fish, and eggs create fewer wastes than other sources of protein. Beans, whole grains, soy products, nuts and nut butters, and dairy products can also be good sources of protein. Most people eat more protein than they need. Eating high-quality protein and smaller portions of protein can help protect the kidneys.\\n                \\nMore information about nutrition for kidney disease is provided in the NIDDK health topics:\\n                \\n- Nutrition for Children with Chronic Kidney Disease  - Nutrition for Adults with Early Chronic Kidney Disease  - Nutrition for Adults with Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease\\n                \\nThe National Kidney Disease Education Program offers a series of easy-to-read fact sheets about nutrition for people with CKD.', '- Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a genetic disorder that causes numerous cysts to grow in the kidneys.  - A gene mutation, or defect, causes polycystic kidney disease.  - Autosomal dominant PKD is the most common form of PKD and the most common inherited disorder of the kidneys.  - Health care providers identify most cases of autosomal dominant PKD between the ages of 30 and 50.  - The most common symptoms of PKD are pain in the back and sidesbetween the ribs and hipsand headaches. The pain can be temporary or persistent, mild or severe. Hematuriablood in the urinemay also be a sign of autosomal dominant PKD.  - The complications of autosomal dominant PKD include the following:      - pain    - high blood pressure    - kidney failure    - urinary tract infections (UTIs)    - kidney stones    - liver cysts    - pancreatic cysts    - abnormal heart valves    - diverticula    - brain aneurysms    - A health care provider diagnoses autosomal dominant PKD using imaging tests and genetic testing.  - A radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imagingwill interpret the images produced by the following imaging tests:      - ultrasound    - computerized tomography scans    - magnetic resonance imaging    - Genetic testing can show whether a persons cells carry a gene mutation that causes autosomal dominant PKD. A health care provider may also use genetic testing results to determine whether someone with a family history of PKD is likely to develop the disorder in the future. Prenatal testing can diagnose autosomal recessive PKD in unborn children.  - Although a cure for autosomal dominant PKD is not currently available, treatment can ease symptoms and prolong life.  - Autosomal recessive PKD is a rare genetic disorder that affects the liver as well as the kidneys.  - The complications of autosomal recessive PKD include the following:      - death due to breathing problems    - kidney failure    - liver scarring    - high blood pressure    - UTIs    - A health care provider diagnoses autosomal recessive PKD with ultrasound imaging, even in a fetus or newborn.  - Treatments for autosomal recessive PKD focus on the symptoms and complications.  - Scientists have not yet found a way to prevent PKD. However, people with PKD may slow the progression of kidney damage caused by high blood pressure through lifestyle changes, diet, and blood pressure medications.  - People with any kind of kidney disease, including PKD, should talk with a dietitian about foods they should add to their diet and foods that might be harmful.', 'When a person has only one kidney or one working kidney, this kidney is called a solitary kidney. The three main causes of a solitary kidney are\\n                \\n- birth defects. People with kidney agenesis are born with only one kidney. People born with kidney dysplasia have both kidneys; however, one kidney does not function. Many people with kidney agenesis or kidney dysplasia do not discover that they have a solitary kidney until they have an x ray, an ultrasound, or surgery for an unrelated condition.  - surgical removal of a kidney. Some people must have a kidney removed to treat cancer or another disease or injury. When a kidney is removed surgically due to disease or for donation, both the kidney and ureter are removed.  - kidney donation. A growing number of people are donating a kidney to be transplanted into a family member or friend whose kidneys have failed.\\n                \\nIn general, people with a solitary kidney lead full, healthy lives. However, some people are more likely to develop kidney disease.', 'The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They are located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. Every day, the kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine, composed of wastes and extra fluid. The urine flows from the kidneys to the bladder through tubes called ureters. The bladder stores urine until releasing it through urination.']}"}, "time": 1746283484.448946}
