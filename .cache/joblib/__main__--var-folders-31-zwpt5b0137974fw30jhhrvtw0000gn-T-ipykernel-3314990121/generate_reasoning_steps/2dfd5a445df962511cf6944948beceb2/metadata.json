These sporadic cases may not be inherited, or they may have an inheritance pattern that is unknown.  Among familial cases of Parkinson disease, the inheritance pattern differs depending on the gene that is altered. If the LRRK2 or SNCA gene is involved, the disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition.  If the PARK2, PARK7, or PINK1 gene is involved, Parkinson disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. This type of inheritance means that two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. Most often, the parents of an individual with autosomal recessive Parkinson disease each carry one copy of the altered gene but do not show signs and symptoms of the disorder.  When genetic alterations modify the risk of developing Parkinson disease, the inheritance pattern is usually unknown.', \"These resources address the diagnosis or management of Parkinson disease:  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Parkinson Disease Overview  - Genetic Testing Registry: Parkinson disease 1  - Genetic Testing Registry: Parkinson disease 10  - Genetic Testing Registry: Parkinson disease 11  - Genetic Testing Registry: Parkinson disease 12  - Genetic Testing Registry: Parkinson disease 13  - Genetic Testing Registry: Parkinson disease 14  - Genetic Testing Registry: Parkinson disease 15  - Genetic Testing Registry: Parkinson disease 16  - Genetic Testing Registry: Parkinson disease 17  - Genetic Testing Registry: Parkinson disease 18  - Genetic Testing Registry: Parkinson disease 2  - Genetic Testing Registry: Parkinson disease 3  - Genetic Testing Registry: Parkinson disease 4  - Genetic Testing Registry: Parkinson disease 5  - Genetic Testing Registry: Parkinson disease 6, autosomal recessive early-onset  - Genetic Testing Registry: Parkinson disease 7  - Genetic Testing Registry: Parkinson disease 8, autosomal dominant  - Genetic Testing Registry: Parkinson disease, late-onset  - Genetic Testing Registry: Parkinson disease, mitochondrial  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Parkinson's Disease  - Michael J.

The abnormal movements that occur in ADCY5-related dyskinesia typically appear as sudden (paroxysmal) jerks, twitches, tremors, muscle tensing (dystonia), or writhing (choreiform) movements, and can affect the limbs, neck, and face.  The abnormal movements associated with ADCY5-related dyskinesia usually begin between infancy and late adolescence. They can occur continually during waking hours and in some cases also during sleep. Severely affected infants may experience weak muscle tone (hypotonia) and delay in development of motor skills such as crawling and walking; these individuals may have difficulties with activities of daily living and may eventually require a wheelchair. In more mildly affected individuals, the condition has little impact on walking and other motor skills, although the abnormal movements can lead to clumsiness or difficulty with social acceptance in school or other situations.  In some people with ADCY5-related dyskinesia, the disorder is generally stable throughout their lifetime. In others, it slowly gets worse (progresses) in both frequency and severity before stabilizing or even improving in middle age. Anxiety, fatigue, and other stress can temporarily increase the severity of the signs and symptoms of ADCY5-related dyskinesia, while some affected individuals may experience remission periods of days or weeks without abnormal movements. Life expectancy and intelligence are unaffected by this disorder.', 'The prevalence of ADCY5-related dyskinesia is unknown. At least 50 affected individuals have been described in the medical literature.']}"}, "time": 1746283447.182889}
