Symptoms for people with multisystemic smooth muscle dysfunction syndrome can include the following : Congenital mydriasis (fixed dilated pupils) Patent Ductus Arteriosus Vascular problems including aneurysms Gastrintestinal problems Weak bladder Lung disease White matter abnormalities Changes consistent with MoyaMoya disease The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Multisystemic smooth muscle dysfunction syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal dominant inheritance - Cerebral aneurysm - Cryptorchidism - Hyperperistalsis - Intestinal malrotation - Mydriasis - Patent ductus arteriosus - Pulmonary hypertension - Retinal infarction - Tachypnea - Thoracic aortic aneurysm - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Prurigo nodularis is a skin condition characterized by hard crusty lumps that itch intensely.  The exact cause of the condition is unknown. However, it can occur in isolation or as a result of repeated trauma to chronic pruritus (itching). Treatment for the condition can be challenging.', 'Is there treatment for prurigo nodularis? Prurigo nodularis can be challenging to treat.  Due to the intensity of the itch patients may go from doctor to doctor without receiving much relief. Treatment may vary from person to person, as no one treatment is always effective at alleviating symptoms. Several treatments may need to be tried.
