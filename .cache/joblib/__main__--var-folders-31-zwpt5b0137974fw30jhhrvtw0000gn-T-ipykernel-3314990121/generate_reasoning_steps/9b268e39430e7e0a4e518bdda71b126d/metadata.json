There is little evidence regarding the effectiveness of specific treatment approaches for Ledderhose disease. Initial treatment approach may invovle regular (monthly or less often) glucocorticoid injection and soft shoe inserts with cutouts for the nodules. Surgery, such as selective fasciectomy or dermofasciectomy, has been used as treatment of people who do not respond to initial therapy. Recurrence following surgery is common. Collagenase injection is an additional therapy which has been used with variable sucess. Our search identified one case report describing the use of \"upper lateral arm flaps\" on the feet of two brother\\'s who had multiple recurrences following other procedures.

The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Simosa cranio facial syndrome.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Split hand split foot nystagmus is a rare congenital syndrome characterized by split hand and split foot deformity and eye abnormalities, especially nystagmus. It is thought to have an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Currently, the underlying genetic defect has not been identified. The outlook for children with this condition is good.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Split hand split foot nystagmus? People with this condition are born with split hands and feet. Split hands and split foot refers to a developmental malformation consisting of missing digits (fingers and/or toes), a deep median cleft (cleft down the center of the hand or foot), and fusion of remaining digits. People with this syndrome also have rapid involuntary movements of the eyes, called nystagmus. Abnormalities of the teeth can occur rarely.
