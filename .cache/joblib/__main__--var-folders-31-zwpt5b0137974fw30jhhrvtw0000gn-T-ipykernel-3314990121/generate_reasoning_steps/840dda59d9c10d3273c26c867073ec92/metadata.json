If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Hypomagnesemia 7.5% Autosomal recessive inheritance - Chondrocalcinosis - Constipation - Dehydration - Diarrhea - Failure to thrive - Fetal polyuria - Fever - Frontal bossing - Generalized muscle weakness - Hyperactive renin-angiotensin system - Hyperaldosteronism - Hypercalciuria - Hyperchloridura - Hyperprostaglandinuria - Hypochloremia - Hypokalemia - Hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis - Hyposthenuria - Impaired platelet aggregation - Increased circulating renin level - Increased serum prostaglandin E2 - Increased urinary potassium - Intellectual disability - Large eyes - Low-to-normal blood pressure - Macrocephaly - Macrotia - Muscle cramps - Nephrocalcinosis - Osteopenia - Paresthesia - Polydipsia - Polyhydramnios - Polyuria - Premature birth - Prominent forehead - Renal juxtaglomerular cell hypertrophy/hyperplasia - Renal potassium wasting - Renal salt wasting - Seizures - Short stature - Small for gestational age - Tetany - Triangular face - Vomiting - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Congenital torticollis?

It is often characterized by muscle weakness or stiffness, cramps, and exercise induced muscle fatigue. The exact cause of the condition is unknown. Sporadic and genetic forms have been reported. Some cases appear to be due to dominant mutations in the STIM1 gene.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Tubular aggregate myopathy? In general, many people with tubular aggregate myopathy have muscle weakness, muscle cramps, and exercise induced fatigue. Typically the facial muscles are not affected in tubular aggregate myopathy.

Symptoms of  tubular aggregate myopathy can be be grouped into at least three different types.  The first type is characterized by exercise induced cramps with or without muscle pain associated or not with weakness in the proximal muscles. The second type of tubular aggregate myopathy is characterized by isolated, slowly progressive weakness of the proximal muscles. The third type is characterized by progressive proximal weakness and sometimes fatigability. In this type the serum creatine kinase levels are often elevated.']}"}, "time": 1746283458.919036}
