Factor V deficiency is caused by mutations in the F5 gene that prevent the production of a functional factor V protein or decrease the amount of the protein in the bloodstream. Mutations are present in both copies of the F5 gene in each cell, which prevents blood from clotting normally.', 'How is factor V deficiency treated? Resources state that fresh plasma or fresh frozen plasma infusions will correct the deficiency temporarily and may be administered daily during a bleeding episode or after surgery.  Individuals with factor V deficiency should discuss treatment options with their primary health care provider and a hematologist.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Thyroid cancer, follicular? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Thyroid cancer, follicular. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of metabolism/homeostasis - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Follicular thyroid carcinoma - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Lung agenesis? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Lung agenesis. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition.
