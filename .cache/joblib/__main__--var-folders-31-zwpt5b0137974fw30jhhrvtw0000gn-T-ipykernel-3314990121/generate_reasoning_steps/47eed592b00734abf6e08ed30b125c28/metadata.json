Because Cowden syndrome is associated with an increased risk for certain types of cancer, management is typically focused on high-risk cancer screening. According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network 2014, the recommended screening protocol for Cowden syndrome includes: Cancer Screening for Women Breast self exams beginning at age 18 Clinical breast exams every 6-12 months beginning at age 25** Annual mammogram and breast MRI beginning at age 30-35** Annual screening for endometrial cancer with ultrasound and/or random biopsy may be considered beginning at age 30-35 Prophylactic surgeries may be considered as a preventative option for some forms of cancer Cancer Screening for Men and Women Annual physical examination beginning at age 18** Annual thyroid ultrasound beginning at age 18** Baseline colonoscopy at age 35 with follow-up every 5 years (more frequent if polyps identified) Consider renal (kidney) ultrasound every 1-2 years beginning at age 40 **or individualized based on the earliest diagnosis of cancer in the family GeneReviews offers more specific information on the treatment and management of Cowden syndrome.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Microcephaly cervical spine fusion anomalies?

It only occurs in males. Affected individuals have delayed development that begins in early childhood. Speech difficulties are common. Low muscle tone (hypotonia) and muscle mass leads to difficulty walking and an unsteady gait. Other features include thinning of the bones (osteoporosis), an abnormal curvature of the spine (kyphoscoliosis), and unusual facial features including a prominent lower lip, cleft palate, and facial asymmetry. Snyder-Robinson syndrome is caused by mutations in the SMS gene and is inherited in an X-linked recessive fashion.']}"}, "time": 1746283456.1842382}
