The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Snowflake vitreoretinal degeneration. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal dominant inheritance - Cataract - Vitreoretinal degeneration - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', \"Light chain deposition disease (LCDD) involves the immune system, the body's system of protecting ourselves against infection. The body fights infection with antibodies. Antibodies are made up of small protein segments called light chains and heavy chains. People with LCDD make  too many light chains which get deposited in many different tissues and organs of the body. While LCDD can occur in any organ, the kidneys are always involved. Deposits of light chains can also occur in the liver, heart, small intestine, spleen, skin, nervous system and bone marrow. Additionally, about 50-60% of patients with LCDD have multiple myeloma and 17% have a disease called monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS). Early signs and symptoms of light chain deposition disease may include protein in the urine, high blood pressure, decreased kidney function, and nephrotic syndrome. The goal of treatment in patients with LCDD is to stop/decrease the production of light chains and damage to organs. Treatment options can include: autologous stem cell transplantation; a drug called Bortezomib; a class of drugs called immunomodulatory drugs; and kidney transplant.\", 'Is light chain deposition disease a genetic/inheritable disease? Currently, we are not aware of inherited genes or genetic factors that would increase a persons risk for developing light chain deposition disease. You can read more about risk factors for multiple myeloma and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance at the following links to the MayoClinic.com Website. Multiple myeloma risk factors: http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/multiple-myeloma/DS00415/DSECTION=risk-factors Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance risk factors: http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/multiple-myeloma/DS00415/DSECTION=risk-factors', \"Hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1 (HSN1) is a neurological condition characterized by nerve abnormalities in the legs and feet. Many people with this condition have tingling, weakness, and a reduced ability to feel pain and sense hot and cold. Some affected people do not lose sensation, but instead feel shooting pains in their legs and feet. As HSN1 progresses, sensory problems can affect the hands, arms, shoulders, and abdomen. In rare cases, people with this condition develop sensorineural hearing loss. Symptoms of HSN1 typically begin during a person's teens or twenties and worsen over time.  HSN1 is caused by mutations in any of several genes, depending on the form of HSN1 (HSN1A is caused by mutations in the SPTLC1 gene; HSN1B is linked to a gene located in chromosome 3; HSN1C is caused by mutations in the SPTLC2 gene; HSN1D is caused by mutations in the ATL1 gene and HSN1E is caused by mutations in DNMT1 gene. All forms of HSN1 are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. If symptoms are treated properly, the condition does not appear to affect life expectancy.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283456.496147}
