The condition may also result from a chromosomal abnormality affecting one or more genes. Most genetic changes associated with isolated microphthalmia have been identified only in very small numbers of affected individuals.  Microphthalmia may also be caused by environmental factors that affect early development, such as a shortage of certain vitamins during pregnancy, radiation, infections such as rubella, or exposure to substances that cause birth defects (teratogens).', 'Isolated microphthalmia is sometimes inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. In some cases, parents of affected individuals have less severe eye abnormalities.  When microphthalmia occurs as a feature of a genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality, it may cluster in families according to the inheritance pattern for that condition, which may be autosomal recessive or other patterns.  Often microphthalmia is not inherited, and there is only one affected individual in a family.', 'These resources address the diagnosis or management of microphthalmia:  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Microphthalmia/Anophthalmia/Coloboma Spectrum  - Genetic Testing Registry: Cataract, congenital, with microphthalmia  - Genetic Testing Registry: Cataract, microphthalmia and nystagmus  - Genetic Testing Registry: Microphthalmia, isolated 1  - Genetic Testing Registry: Microphthalmia, isolated 2  - Genetic Testing Registry: Microphthalmia, isolated 3  - Genetic Testing Registry: Microphthalmia, isolated 4  - Genetic Testing Registry: Microphthalmia, isolated 5  - Genetic Testing Registry: Microphthalmia, isolated 6  - Genetic Testing Registry: Microphthalmia, isolated 7  - Genetic Testing Registry: Microphthalmia, isolated 8  - Genetic Testing Registry: Microphthalmia, isolated, with coloboma 1  - Genetic Testing Registry: Microphthalmia, isolated, with coloboma 2  - Genetic Testing Registry: Microphthalmia, isolated, with coloboma 3  - Genetic Testing Registry: Microphthalmia, isolated, with coloboma 4  - Genetic Testing Registry: Microphthalmia, isolated, with coloboma 5  - Genetic Testing Registry: Microphthalmia, isolated, with coloboma 6  - Genetic Testing Registry: Microphthalmia, isolated, with corectopia  - Genetic Testing Registry: Microphthalmos   These resources from MedlinePlus offer information about the diagnosis and management of various health conditions:  - Diagnostic Tests  - Drug Therapy  - Surgery and Rehabilitation  - Genetic Counseling   - Palliative Care', 'Renal tubular acidosis with deafness is a disorder characterized by kidney (renal) problems and hearing loss. The kidneys normally filter fluid and waste products from the body and remove them in urine; however, in people with this disorder, the kidneys do not remove enough acidic compounds from the body. Instead, the acids are absorbed back into the bloodstream, and the blood becomes too acidic. This chemical imbalance, called metabolic acidosis, can result in a range of signs and symptoms that vary in severity. Metabolic acidosis often causes nausea, vomiting, and dehydration; affected infants tend to have problems feeding and gaining weight (failure to thrive). Most children and adults with renal tubular acidosis with deafness have short stature, and many develop kidney stones.  The metabolic acidosis that occurs in renal tubular acidosis with deafness may also lead to softening and weakening of the bones, called rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. This bone disorder is characterized by bone pain, bowed legs, and difficulty walking. Rarely, people with renal tubular acidosis with deafness have episodes of hypokalemic paralysis, a condition that causes extreme muscle weakness associated with low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia).  In people with renal tubular acidosis with deafness, hearing loss caused by changes in the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss) usually begins between childhood and young adulthood, and gradually gets worse. An inner ear abnormality affecting both ears occurs in most people with this disorder. This feature, which is called enlarged vestibular aqueduct, can be seen with medical imaging. The vestibular aqueduct is a bony canal that runs from the inner ear into the temporal bone of the skull and toward the brain. The relationship between enlarged vestibular aqueduct and hearing loss is unclear. In renal tubular acidosis with deafness, enlarged vestibular aqueduct typically occurs in individuals whose hearing loss begins in childhood.']}"}, "time": 1746283452.265483}
