If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Blindness 5% Nystagmus 5% Autosomal recessive inheritance - Cerebral atrophy - Decreased methionine synthase activity - Decreased methylcobalamin - Failure to thrive - Feeding difficulties in infancy - Gait disturbance - Homocystinuria - Hyperhomocystinemia - Hypomethioninemia - Infantile onset - Intellectual disability - Megaloblastic anemia - Muscular hypotonia - Poor coordination - Seizures - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Hypocalcemia, autosomal dominant?

Signs and symptoms of the condition vary but may include severe orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing); fainting; constipation; fixed and dilated pupils; urinary retention; and/or dry mouth and eyes. The exact underlying cause of AAG is poorly understood. Treatment depends on many factors including the severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms present in each person. Due to the rarity of AAG, there are no standard treatment protocols; however, treatment with plasmapheresis, intravenous (IV) immunoglobulin, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs has been reported with variable success. Approximately one third of affected people may improve spontaneously without treatment, but the recovery is often incomplete.\", 'What are the signs and symptoms of autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy? The symptoms of autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy can include: Severe orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing) that persists for weeks to years Fainting Constipation and gastrointestinal dysmotility (a condition in which the muscles and nerves of the digestive system do not move food through the digestive tract efficiently) Urinary retention Fixed and dilated pupils Dry mouth and eyes Some people with autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy present with POTS-like symptoms.']}"}, "time": 1746283459.051667}
