Asbestos is a mineral that, in the past, was widely used in many industries.\\n                \\nAsbestos is made up of tiny fibers that can escape into the air. When breathed in, these fibers can stay in your lungs for a long time. If the fibers build up in your lungs, they can lead to:\\n                \\nPleural plaque. In this condition, the tissue around the lungs and diaphragm (the muscle below your lungs) thickens and hardens. This tissue is called the pleura. Pleural plaque usually causes no symptoms. Rarely, as the pleura thickens, it can trap and compress part of the lung. This may show up as a mass on an x-ray image.\\n                \\nPleural effusion. In this condition, excess fluid builds up in the pleural space. The pleural space is the area between the lungs and the chest wall.\\n                \\nAsbestosis (as-bes-TOE-sis). In this condition, the lung tissue becomes scarred. People who have asbestosis are at greater risk for lung cancer, especially if they smoke.\\n                \\nLung cancer. This type of cancer forms in the lung tissue, usually in the cells lining the air passages.\\n                \\nMesothelioma (MEZ-o-thee-lee-O-ma). This disease is cancer of the pleura.\\n                \\nAsbestos also can cause cancer in the lining of the abdominal cavity. This lining is known as the peritoneum (PER-ih-to-NE-um).\\n                \\nAsbestos-Related Lung Diseases\\n                \\n\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nUntil the 1970s, asbestos was widely used in many industries in the United States. For example, it was used to insulate pipes, boilers, and ships; make brakes; strengthen cement; and fireproof many items, such as drywall.\\n                \\nPeople who worked around asbestos during that time are at risk for asbestos-related lung diseases. People at highest risk include:\\n                \\nUnprotected workers who made, installed, or removed products containing asbestos. People who worked near others who did these jobs also are at risk.\\n                \\nFamily members of workers who were exposed to asbestos. Family members may have breathed in asbestos fibers that workers brought home on their clothes, shoes, or bodies.\\n                \\nPeople who live in areas with large deposits of asbestos in the soil. This risk is limited to areas where the deposits were disturbed and asbestos fibers got into the air.\\n                \\nAsbestos fibers also can be released into the air when older buildings containing asbestos-made products are destroyed. Removing these products during building renovations also can release asbestos fibers into the air.\\n                \\nGenerally, being around asbestos-made products isnt a danger as long as the asbestos is enclosed. This prevents the fibers from getting into the air.\\n                \\nPeople in the United States are less likely to have asbestos-related lung diseases now because the mineral is no longer widely used.\\n                \\nThe use of asbestos is heavily restricted, and rules and standards are now in place to protect workers and others from asbestos exposure. Asbestos is found in only a few new products, such as gaskets used in brakes.\\n                \\nHowever, many countries do not yet restrict asbestos use. People in those countries are still exposed to the mineral.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nThe outlook for people who have asbestos-related lung diseases can vary. It will depend on which disease a person has and how much it has damaged the lungs.\\n                \\nNo treatments can reverse the effects of asbestos on your lungs. However, treatments may help relieve symptoms, slow the progress of the disease, and prevent complications.\\n                \\nIf you've been exposed to asbestos, let your doctor know. He or she can watch you for signs of asbestos-related problems and start treatment early, if needed. Early treatment may help prevent or delay complications.\\n                \\nQuitting smoking and making other lifestyle changes may help people who are at high risk for asbestos-related lung diseases. These lifestyle changes may prevent more serious diseases, such as cancer.\", 'Significant exposure to asbestos fibers causes asbestos-related lung diseases. \"Significant\" usually means you were exposed for at least several months to visible dust from the fibers.\\n                \\nAsbestos fibers are very small. When you breathe in, they can get stuck deep in your lungs. The fibers remain in your lung tissue for a long time and may cause scarring and inflammation. This can lead to pleural plaque and widespread pleural thickening, pleural effusion, asbestosis, lung cancer, or mesothelioma.\\n                \\nGenerally, asbestos-related lung diseases develop 10 to 40 or more years after a person has been exposed to asbestos.\\n                \\nBeing around products that contain asbestos isn\\'t a danger, as long as the asbestos is enclosed. This prevents the fibers from getting into the air.', \"Until the late 1970s, asbestos was widely used in many industries in the United States. During that time, workplace rules to ensure workers' safety around asbestos weren't required by law.\\n                \\nAsbestos was used in or with many products. Examples include steam pipes, boilers, furnaces, and furnace ducts; wallboard; floor and ceiling tiles; wood-burning stoves and gas fireplaces; car brakes, clutches, and gaskets; railroad engines; roofing and shingles; and wall-patching materials and paints.\\n                \\nAsbestos also was used in many other products, such as fireproof gloves, ironing board covers, cooking pot handles, and hairdryers.\\n                \\nAnyone employed for a prolonged period in mining, milling, making, or installing asbestos products before the late 1970s is at risk for asbestos-related lung diseases. Some examples of these workers include:\\n                \\nMiners\\n                \\nAircraft and auto mechanics\\n                \\nBuilding construction workers\\n                \\nElectricians\\n                \\nShipyard workers\\n                \\nBoiler operators\\n                \\nBuilding engineers\\n                \\nRailroad workers\\n                \\nIn general, the risk is greatest for people who worked with asbestos and were exposed for at least several months to visible dust from asbestos fibers. The risk for asbestos-related lung diseases also depends on:\\n                \\nHow much asbestos you were exposed to.\\n                \\nHow long you were exposed to asbestos, and how often during that time you were in direct contact with it.\\n                \\nThe size, shape, and chemical makeup of the asbestos fibers. Different types of asbestos fibers can affect the lungs differently. For example, chrysotile asbestos (a curly fiber) is less likely to cause mesothelioma than amphibole asbestos (a straight fiber).\\n                \\nYour personal risks, such as smoking or having an existing lung disease.\\n                \\nFamily members of people exposed to asbestos on the job also may be at risk. Family members may have breathed in asbestos fibers that were brought home on workers clothes, shoes, and bodies.\\n                \\nPeople who live in areas that have large deposits of asbestos in the soil also are at risk for asbestos-related lung diseases. However, this risk is limited to areas where the deposits were disturbed and asbestos fibers got into the air.\\n                \\nAsbestos fibers also can be released into the air when older buildings containing asbestos-made products are destroyed. Removing the products, such as during a building renovation, also can release asbestos fibers into the air.\\n                \\nGenerally, being around asbestos-made products isnt a danger, as long as the asbestos is enclosed. This prevents the fibers from getting into the air.\\n                \\nPeople in the United States are less likely to develop asbestos-related lung diseases today than in the past. This is because the mineral no longer is widely used. Also, where asbestos is still used, rules and standards are now in place to protect workers and others from asbestos exposure.\", \"The signs and symptoms of asbestos-related lung diseases vary. They depend on which disease you have and how much it has damaged your lungs. Signs and symptoms may not appear for 10 to 40 or more years after exposure to asbestos.\\n                \\nIf you have pleural plaque, you may not have any signs or symptoms. Pleural effusion may cause pain on one side of the chest. Both conditions often are found with a chest x ray. These conditions may occur earlier than other asbestos-related lung diseases.\\n                \\nThe main symptom of asbestosis is shortness of breath with physical exertion. You also may have a dry cough and feel tired. If your doctor listens to your lungs with a stethoscope, he or she may hear a crackling sound when you breathe in.\\n                \\nThe symptoms of lung cancer may include a worsening cough or a cough that won't go away, trouble breathing, ongoing chest pain, and coughing up blood. Other symptoms of lung cancer include frequent lung infections, fatigue (tiredness), and weight loss without a known cause.\\n                \\nSymptoms of mesothelioma include shortness of breath and chest pain due to pleural effusion.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283466.5496478}
