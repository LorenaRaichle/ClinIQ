It accounts for approximately 1% of all DFSP cases. Bednar tumor is also known as pigmented DFSP because it contains dark-colored cells that give may give the tumor a multi-colored (i.e red and brown) appearance. The tumor may begin as a painless, slow-growing papule or patch of skin; however, accelerated growth, bleeding and/or pain are often observed as it grows. The underlying cause of Bednar tumor is unknown. There is currently no evidence of an inherited risk for the condition and most cases occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. Treatment varies based on the severity of the condition, the location of the tumor and the overall health of the affected person. The tumor is generally treated with surgery. In advanced cases, radiation therapy and/or systemic therapy may be recommended, as well.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Spastic paraplegia 2? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Spastic paraplegia 2. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Gait disturbance 90% Hyperreflexia 90% Muscle weakness 90% Abnormal renal physiology 50% Abnormality of extrapyramidal motor function 50% Bowel incontinence 50% Cognitive impairment 50% Optic atrophy 50% Incoordination 7.5% Limitation of joint mobility 7.5% Neurological speech impairment 7.5% Nystagmus 7.5% Pulmonary embolism 7.5% Recurrent respiratory infections 7.5% Babinski sign - Degeneration of the lateral corticospinal tracts - Dysarthria - Dysmetria - Flexion contracture - Intellectual disability - Juvenile onset - Lower limb muscle weakness - Lower limb spasticity - Pes cavus - Phenotypic variability - Skeletal muscle atrophy - Spastic gait - Spastic paraparesis - Spastic paraplegia - Spinocerebellar tract degeneration - X-linked recessive inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Eisenmenger syndrome is a rare progressive heart condition caused by a structural error in the heart, typically a \"hole in the heart\" (ventricular septal defect) present at birth (congenital heart defect). This causes abnormal blood flow in the heart, resulting in high pressure within the pulmonary artery, the main blood vessel that connects the heart to the lungs (pulmonary hypertension).', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Eisenmenger syndrome? Symptoms of Eisenmenger include shortness of breath, chest pain, feeling tired or dizzy, fainting, abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia), stroke, coughing up blood, swelling of joints from excess uric acid (gout) and, bluish lips, fingers, toes, and skin (cyanosis). Eisenmenger syndrome usually develops before a child reaches puberty but can also develop in young adulthood.']}"}, "time": 1746283456.3981}
