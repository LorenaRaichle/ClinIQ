You may want to make surprise visits at different times of the day to verify conditions. - Is the nursing home Medicare- or Medicaid-certified?  - Does the nursing home have the level of care needed (such as skilled or custodial care) and is a bed available?  - Does the nursing home have special services if needed in a separate unit (such as a ventilator or rehabilitation) and is a bed available?   - Are residents clean, well groomed, and appropriately dressed for the season or time of day?  - Is the nursing home free from strong, unpleasant odors?  - Does the nursing home appear to be clean and well kept?  - Does the nursing home conduct staff background checks?  - Does the nursing home staff interact warmly and respectfully with home residents?  - Does the nursing home meet cultural, religious, and language needs?  - Are the nursing home and the current administrator licensed?

Does the nursing home meet cultural, religious, and language needs? Are the nursing home and the current administrator licensed?', 'Nursing home care can be very expensive. Medicare generally doesn\\'t cover nursing home care. There are many ways people can pay for nursing home care. For example, they can use their own money, they may be able to get help from their state, or they may use long-term care insurance. Nursing home care isn\\'t covered by many types of health insurance. Most people who enter nursing homes begin by paying for their care out of their own pocket. As they use up their resources over a period of time, they may eventually become eligible for Medicaid. Medicaid is a state and Federal program that will pay most nursing home costs for people with limited income and resources. Eligibility varies by state. Medicaid pays for care for about 7 out of every 10 nursing home residents. Medicaid will pay for nursing home care only when provided in a Medicaid-certified facility. For information about Medicaid eligibility, call your state Medical Assistance (Medicaid) Office. If you have questions about Medicaid, you can call your State Medical Assistance (Medicaid) office for more information. Visit http://www.medicare.gov on the web.

Skilled care is health care given when the person needs skilled nursing or rehabilitation staff to manage, observe, and evaluate his or her care. Care that can be given by non-professional staff isn\\'t considered skilled care. Medicare does not cover custodial care or adult day care.
