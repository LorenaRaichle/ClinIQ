Asthma causes recurring periods of wheezing (a whistling sound when you breathe), chest tightness, shortness of breath, and coughing. The coughing often occurs at night or early in the morning.\\n                \\nAsthma affects people of all ages, but it most often starts during childhood. In the United States, more than 25 million people are known to have asthma. About 7million of these people are children.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nTo understand asthma, it helps to know how the airways work. The airways are tubes that carry air into and out of your lungs. People who have asthma have inflamed airways. The inflammation makes the airways swollen and very sensitive. The airways tend to react strongly to certain inhaled substances.\\n                \\nWhen the airways react, the muscles around them tighten. This narrows the airways, causing less air to flow into the lungs. The swelling also can worsen, making the airways even narrower. Cells in the airways might make more mucus than usual. Mucus is a sticky, thick liquid that can further narrow the airways.\\n                \\nThis chain reaction can result in asthma symptoms. Symptoms can happen each time the airways are inflamed.\\n                \\nAsthma\\n                \\n\\n                \\nSometimes asthma symptoms are mild and go away on their own or after minimal treatment with asthma medicine. Other times, symptoms continue to get worse.\\n                \\nWhen symptoms get more intense and/or more symptoms occur, you're having an asthma attack. Asthma attacks also are called flareups or exacerbations (eg-zas-er-BA-shuns).\\n                \\nTreating symptoms when you first notice them is important. This will help prevent the symptoms from worsening and causing a severe asthma attack. Severe asthma attacks may require emergency care, and they can be fatal.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nAsthma has no cure. Even when you feel fine, you still have the disease and it can flare up at any time.\\n                \\nHowever, with today's knowledge and treatments, most people who have asthma are able to manage the disease. They have few, if any, symptoms. They can live normal, active lives and sleep through the night without interruption from asthma.\\n                \\nIf you have asthma, you can take an active role in managing the disease. For successful, thorough, and ongoing treatment, build strong partnerships with your doctor and other health care providers.\", 'The exact cause of asthma isn\\'t known. Researchers think some genetic and environmental factors interact to cause asthma, most often early in life. These factors include:\\n                \\nAn inherited tendency to develop allergies, called atopy (AT-o-pe)\\n                \\nParents who have asthma\\n                \\nCertain respiratory infections during childhood\\n                \\nContact with some airborne allergens or exposure to some viral infections in infancy or in early childhood when the immune system is developing\\n                \\nIf asthma or atopy runs in your family, exposure to irritants (for example, tobacco smoke) may make your airways more reactive to substances in the air.\\n                \\nSome factors may be more likely to cause asthma in some people than in others. Researchers continue to explore what causes asthma.\\n                \\nThe \"Hygiene Hypothesis\"\\n                \\nOne theory researchers have for what causes asthma is the \"hygiene hypothesis.\" They believe that our Western lifestylewith its emphasis on hygiene and sanitationhas resulted in changes in our living conditions and an overall decline in infections in early childhood.\\n                \\nMany young children no longer have the same types of environmental exposures and infections as children did in the past. This affects the way that young children\\'s immune systems develop during very early childhood, and it may increase their risk for atopy and asthma. This is especially true for children who have close family members with one or both of these conditions.', \"Asthma affects people of all ages, but it most often starts during childhood. In the United States, more than 22 million people are known to have asthma. Nearly 6 million of these people are children.\\n                \\nYoung children who often wheeze and have respiratory infectionsas well as certain other risk factorsare at highest risk of developing asthma that continues beyond 6 years of age. The other risk factors include having allergies, eczema (an allergic skin condition), or parents who have asthma.\\n                \\nAmong children, more boys have asthma than girls. But among adults, more women have the disease than men. It's not clear whether or how sex and sex hormones play a role in causing asthma.\\n                \\nMost, but not all, people who have asthma have allergies.\\n                \\nSome people develop asthma because of contact with certain chemical irritants or industrial dusts in the workplace. This type of asthma is called occupational asthma.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283465.466632}
