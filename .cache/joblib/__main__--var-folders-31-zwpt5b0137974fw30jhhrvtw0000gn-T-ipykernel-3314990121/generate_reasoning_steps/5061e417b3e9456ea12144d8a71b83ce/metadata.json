In this disorder, either both copies of the RBM8A gene in each cell have mutations or, more commonly, one copy of the gene has a mutation and the other is lost as part of a deleted segment on chromosome 1. The affected individual usually inherits an RBM8A gene mutation from one parent. In about 75 percent of cases, the affected person inherits a copy of chromosome 1 with the 200-kb deletion from the other parent. In the remaining cases, the deletion occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early fetal development. Although parents of an individual with TAR syndrome can carry an RBM8A gene mutation or a 200-kb deletion, they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.', 'These resources address the diagnosis or management of TAR syndrome:  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Thrombocytopenia Absent Radius Syndrome  - Genetic Testing Registry: Radial aplasia-thrombocytopenia syndrome  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Skeletal Limb Abnormalities   These resources from MedlinePlus offer information about the diagnosis and management of various health conditions:  - Diagnostic Tests  - Drug Therapy  - Surgery and Rehabilitation  - Genetic Counseling   - Palliative Care', \"Spondyloenchondrodysplasia with immune dysregulation (SPENCDI) is an inherited condition that primarily affects bone growth and immune system function. The signs and symptoms of SPENCDI can become apparent anytime from infancy to adolescence.  Bone abnormalities in individuals with SPENCDI include flattened spinal bones (platyspondyly), abnormalities at the ends of long bones in the limbs (metaphyseal dysplasia), and areas of damage (lesions) on the long bones and spinal bones that can be seen on x-rays. Additional skeletal problems occur because of abnormalities of the tough, flexible tissue called cartilage that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. Individuals with SPENCDI often have areas where cartilage did not convert to bone. They may also have noncancerous growths of cartilage (enchondromas). The bone and cartilage problems contribute to short stature in people with SPENCDI.  Individuals with SPENCDI have a combination of immune system problems. Many affected individuals have malfunctioning immune systems that attack the body's own tissues and organs, which is known as an autoimmune reaction. The malfunctioning immune system can lead to a variety of disorders, such as a decrease in blood cells called platelets (thrombocytopenia), premature destruction of red blood cells (hemolytic anemia), an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism), or chronic inflammatory disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, affected individuals often have abnormal immune cells that cannot grow and divide in response to harmful invaders such as bacteria and viruses. As a result of this immune deficiency, these individuals have frequent fevers and recurrent respiratory infections.  Some people with SPENCDI have neurological problems such as abnormal muscle stiffness (spasticity), difficulty with coordinating movements (ataxia), and intellectual disability. They may also have abnormal deposits of calcium (calcification) in the brain.  Due to the range of immune system problems, people with SPENCDI typically have a shortened life expectancy, but figures vary widely.\", 'SPENCDI appears to be a rare condition, although its prevalence is unknown.']}"}, "time": 1746283448.4059992}
