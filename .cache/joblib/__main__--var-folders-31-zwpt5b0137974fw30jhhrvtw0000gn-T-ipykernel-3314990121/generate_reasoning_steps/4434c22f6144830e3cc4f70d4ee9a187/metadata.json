Presently there are no treatment guidelines for disseminated peritoneal leiomyomatosis (DPL). DPL is considered a benign condition and some cases of DPL resolve after the baby is delivered (if pregnant), hormone treatment is stopped (including both birth control pill and hormone replacement therapy), or a hormone producing tumor is removed. However, surgery may be suggested based on the size and location of the tumor.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Paragangliomas 4? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Paragangliomas 4. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Gastrointestinal stroma tumor 5% Neuroblastoma 5% Abnormality of urine catecholamine concentration - Adrenal pheochromocytoma - Adult onset - Anxiety (with pheochromocytoma) - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Chemodectoma - Diaphoresis (with pheochromocytoma) - Extraadrenal pheochromocytoma - Glomus jugular tumor - Headache (with pheochromocytoma) - Hypertension associated with pheochromocytoma - Incomplete penetrance - Palpitations - Palpitations (with pheochromocytoma) - Paraganglioma-related cranial nerve palsy - Pulsatile tinnitus (tympanic paraganglioma) - Renal cell carcinoma - Tachycardia (with pheochromocytoma) - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Hepatocellular carcinoma, childhood is a rare type of cancer of the liver that affects children. Symptoms may include a mass in the abdomen, swollen abdomen, abdominal pain, weight loss, poor appetite, jaundice, vomiting, fever, itchy skin, anemia, and back pain.
