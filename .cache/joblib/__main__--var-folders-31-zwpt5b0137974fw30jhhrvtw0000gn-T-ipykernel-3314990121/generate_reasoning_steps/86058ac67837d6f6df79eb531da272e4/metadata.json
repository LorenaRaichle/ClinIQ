The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Whistling face syndrome, recessive form. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal recessive inheritance - Blepharophimosis - Camptodactyly - Chin dimple - Elbow flexion contracture - Epicanthus - Flat midface - High palate - Hypertelorism - Inguinal hernia - Knee flexion contracture - Kyphoscoliosis - Long philtrum - Malar flattening - Microglossia - Narrow mouth - Prominent nasal bridge - Ptosis - Short neck - Short palpebral fissure - Shoulder flexion contracture - Talipes equinovarus - Telecanthus - Ulnar deviation of finger - Underdeveloped nasal alae - Whistling appearance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Gorlin Chaudhry Moss syndrome?

Characteristic features of this condition include underdeveloped or absent collarbones (clavicles) and delayed closing of the spaces between the bones of the skull (fontanels). Individuals with cleidocranial dysplasia may also have decreased bone density (osteopenia), osteoporosis, dental abnormalities, hearing loss, and recurrent sinus and ear infections. Mutations in the RUNX2 gene cause most cases of cleidocranial dysplasia. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. In some cases, a person inherits cleidocranial dysplasia from a parent who also has the condition. Other cases result from new mutations (de novo mutations) in the RUNX2 gene.  Dental problems are addressed with several procedures. Ear and sinus infections may be treated with antibiotics and use of ear tubes. In some cases surgery is needed for the cranial defect.']}"}, "time": 1746283458.499861}
