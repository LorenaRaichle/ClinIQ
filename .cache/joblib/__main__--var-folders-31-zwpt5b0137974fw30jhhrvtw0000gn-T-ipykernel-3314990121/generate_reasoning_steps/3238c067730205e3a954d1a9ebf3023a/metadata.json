Somatic gene mutations are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells. These changes are not inherited.  The BRAF gene provides instructions for making a protein that is normally switched on and off in response to signals that control cell growth and development. Somatic mutations cause the BRAF protein in affected cells to be continuously active and to transmit messages to the nucleus even in the absence of these chemical signals. The overactive protein may contribute to the development of Langerhans cell histiocytosis by allowing the Langerhans cells to grow and divide uncontrollably.  Changes in other genes have also been identified in the Langerhans cells of some individuals with Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Some researchers believe that additional factors, such as viral infections and environmental toxins, may also influence the development of this complex disorder.\", 'Langerhans cell histiocytosis is usually not inherited and typically occurs in people with no history of the disorder in their family.  A few families with multiple cases of Langerhans cell histiocytosis have been identified, but the inheritance pattern is unknown.', \"These resources address the diagnosis or management of Langerhans cell histiocytosis:  - Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center  - Cleveland Clinic  - Genetic Testing Registry: Langerhans cell histiocytosis, multifocal  - National Cancer Institute: Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis Treatment  - Seattle Children's Hospital  - St. Jude Children's Research Hospital  - Sydney Children's Hospital   These resources from MedlinePlus offer information about the diagnosis and management of various health conditions:  - Diagnostic Tests  - Drug Therapy  - Surgery and Rehabilitation  - Genetic Counseling   - Palliative Care\", 'Leptin receptor deficiency is a condition that causes severe obesity beginning in the first few months of life. Affected individuals are of normal weight at birth, but they are constantly hungry and quickly gain weight. The extreme hunger leads to chronic excessive eating (hyperphagia) and obesity. Beginning in early childhood, affected individuals develop abnormal eating behaviors such as fighting with other children over food, hoarding food, and eating in secret.  People with leptin receptor deficiency also have hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which is a condition caused by reduced production of hormones that direct sexual development. Affected individuals experience delayed puberty or do not go through puberty, and may be unable to conceive children (infertile).']}"}, "time": 1746283453.790516}
