In some cases, a diagnosis of dextrocardia with situs inversus is suspected based on the presence of concerning signs and symptoms; however, it is often discovered by chance when an x-ray or ultrasound is performed to investigate a different condition. Computed tomography (CT) scanning is typically the preferred examination to confirm the diagnosis of dextrocardia with situs inversus. Magnetic resonance imaging may be substituted in cases that are associated with congenital heart defects.', 'How might dextrocardia with situs inversus be treated? Treatment typically depends on the heart or physical problems the person may have in addition to dextrocardia with situs inversus. For example, infants born with congenital heart defects or other organ malformations may require surgery. The management of people affected by Kartagener syndrome typically includes measures to enhance clearance of mucus, prevent respiratory infections, and treat bacterial infections. GeneReviews offers more specific information on the treatment of Kartagener syndrome and other types of primary ciliary dyskinesia.

The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Schisis association. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Anencephaly 90% Cleft palate 90% Non-midline cleft lip 90% Omphalocele 90% Congenital diaphragmatic hernia 50% Encephalocele 50% Spina bifida 50% Microcephaly 7.5% Micromelia 7.5% Renal hypoplasia/aplasia 7.5% Tracheoesophageal fistula 7.5% Urogenital fistula 7.5% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Mandibulofacial dysostosis with microcephaly (MFDM) is a disorder characterized by developmental delay and abnormalities of the head and face. Affected people are usually born with a small head that does not grow at the same rate as the body (progressive microcephaly). Developmental delay and intellectual disability can range from mild to severe. Facial abnormalities may include underdevelopment of the midface and cheekbones; a small lower jaw; small and abnormally-shaped ears; and other distinctive facial features. Other features of MFDM may include hearing loss, cleft palate, heart problems, abnormalities of the thumbs, abnormalities of the trachea and/or esophagus, and short stature. MFDM is caused by mutations in the EFTUD2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.']}"}, "time": 1746283456.558458}
