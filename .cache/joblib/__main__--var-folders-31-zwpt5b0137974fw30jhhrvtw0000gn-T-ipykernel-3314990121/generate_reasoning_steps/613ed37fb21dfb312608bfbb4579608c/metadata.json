You're often in a hospital for at least the first week or more of treatment. This allows your doctor to make sure the medicine is helping.\\n                \\nIf you're allowed to go home before the treatment is done, the antibiotics are almost always continued by vein at home. You'll need special care if you get IV antibiotic treatment at home. Before you leave the hospital, your medical team will arrange for you to receive home-based care so you can continue your treatment.\\n                \\nYou also will need close medical followup, usually by a team of doctors. This team often includes a doctor who specializes in infectious diseases, a cardiologist (heart specialist), and a heart surgeon.\\n                \\nSurgery\\n                \\nSometimes surgery is needed to repair or replace a damaged heart valve or to help clear up IE. For example, IE caused by fungi often requires surgery. This is because this type of IE is harder to treat than IE caused by bacteria.\", \"If you're at risk for infective endocarditis (IE), you can take steps to prevent the infection and its complications.\\n                \\nBe alert to the signs and symptoms of IE. Contact your doctor right away if you have any of these signs or symptoms, especially a persistent fever or unexplained fatigue (tiredness).\\n                \\nBrush and floss your teeth regularly, and have regular dental checkups. Germs from a gum infection can enter your bloodstream.\\n                \\nAvoid body piercing, tattoos, and other procedures that may allow germs to enter your bloodstream.\\n                \\nResearch shows that not everyone at risk for IE needs to take antibiotics before routine dental exams and certain other dental and medical procedures.\\n                \\nLet your health care providers, including your dentist, know if you're at risk for IE. They can tell you whether you need antibiotics before exams and procedures.\", 'Espaol\\n                \\nThe terms \"overweight\" and \"obesity\" refer to body weight thats greater than what is considered healthy for a certain height.\\n                \\nThe most useful measure of overweight and obesity is body mass index (BMI). BMI is calculated from your height and weight. For more information about BMI, go to \"How Are Overweight and Obesity Diagnosed?\"\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nMillions of Americans and people worldwide are overweight or obese. Being overweight or obese puts you at risk for many health problems. The more body fat that you have and the more you weigh, the more likely you are to develop:\\n                \\nCoronary heart disease\\n                \\nHigh blood pressure\\n                \\nType 2 diabetes\\n                \\nGallstones\\n                \\nBreathing problems\\n                \\nCertain cancers\\n                \\nYour weight is the result of many factors. These factors include environment, family history and genetics, metabolism (the way your body changes food and oxygen into energy), behavior or habits, and more.\\n                \\nYou can\\'t change some factors, such as family history. However, you can change other factors, such as your lifestyle habits.\\n                \\nFor example, follow a healthy eating plan and keep your calorie needs in mind. Be physically active and try to limit the amount of time that you\\'re inactive.\\n                \\nWeight-loss medicines and surgery also are options for some people if lifestyle changes aren\\'t enough.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nReaching and staying at a healthy weight is a long-term challenge for people who are overweight or obese. But it also is a chance to lower your risk for other serious health problems. With the right treatment and motivation, it\\'s possible to lose weight and lower your long-term disease risk.', \"Lack of Energy Balance\\n                \\nA lack of energy balance most often causes overweight and obesity. Energy balance means that your energy IN equals your energy OUT.\\n                \\nEnergy IN is the amount of energy or calories you get from food and drinks. Energy OUT is the amount of energy your body uses for things like breathing, digesting, and being physically active.\\n                \\nTo maintain a healthy weight, your energy IN and OUT don't have to balance exactly every day. It's the balance over time that helps you maintain a healthy weight.\\n                \\nThe same amount of energy IN and energy OUT over time = weight stays the same\\n                \\nMore energy IN than energy OUT over time = weight gain\\n                \\nMore energy OUT than energy IN over time = weight loss\\n                \\nOverweight and obesity happen over time when you take in more calories than you use.\\n                \\nOther Causes\\n                \\nAn Inactive Lifestyle\\n                \\nMany Americans aren't very physically active. One reason for this is that many people spend hours in front of TVs and computers doing work, schoolwork, and leisure activities. In fact, more than 2 hours a day of regular TV viewing time has been linked to overweight and obesity.\\n                \\nOther reasons for not being active include: relying on cars instead of walking, fewer physical demands at work or at home because of modern technology and conveniences, and lack of physical education classes in schools.\\n                \\nPeople who are inactive are more likely to gain weight because they don't burn the calories that they take in from food and drinks. An inactive lifestyle also raises your risk for coronary heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, colon cancer, and other health problems.\\n                \\nEnvironment\\n                \\nOur environment doesn't support healthy lifestyle habits; in fact, it encourages obesity. Some reasons include:\\n                \\nLack of neighborhood sidewalks and safe places for recreation. Not having area parks, trails, sidewalks, and affordable gyms makes it hard for people to be physically active.\\n                \\nWork schedules. People often say that they don't have time to be physically active because of long work hours and time spent commuting.\\n                \\nOversized food portions. Americans are exposed to huge food portions in restaurants, fast food places, gas stations, movie theaters, supermarkets, and even at home. Some of these meals and snacks can feed two or more people. Eating large portions means too much energy IN. Over time, this will cause weight gain if it isn't balanced with physical activity.\\n                \\nLack of access to healthy foods. Some people don't live in neighborhoods that have supermarkets that sell healthy foods, such as fresh fruits and vegetables. Or, for some people, these healthy foods are too costly.\\n                \\nFood advertising. Americans are surrounded by ads from food companies. Often children are the targets of advertising for high-calorie, high-fat snacks and sugary drinks. The goal of these ads is to sway people to buy these high-calorie foods, and often they do.\\n                \\nGenes and Family History\\n                \\nStudies of identical twins who have been raised apart show that genes have a strong influence on a person's weight. Overweight and obesity tend to run in families. Your chances of being overweight are greater if one or both of your parents are overweight or obese.\\n                \\nYour genes also may affect the amount of fat you store in your body and where on your body you carry the extra fat. Because families also share food and physical activity habits, a link exists between genes and the environment.\\n                \\nChildren adopt the habits of their parents. A child who has overweight parents who eat high-calorie foods and are inactive will likely become overweight too. However, if the family adopts healthy food and physical activity habits, the child's chance of being overweight or obese is reduced.\\n                \\nHealth Conditions\\n                \\nSome hormone problems may cause overweight and obesity, such as underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism), Cushing's syndrome, and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).\\n                \\nUnderactive thyroid is a condition in which the thyroid gland doesn't make enough thyroid hormone. Lack of thyroid hormone will slow down your metabolism and cause weight gain. You'll also feel tired and weak.\\n                \\nCushing's syndrome is a condition in which the body's adrenal glands make too much of the hormone cortisol. Cushing's syndrome also can develop if a person takes high doses of certain medicines, such as prednisone, for long periods.\\n                \\nPeople who have Cushing's syndrome gain weight, have upper-body obesity, a rounded face, fat around the neck, and thin arms and legs.\\n                \\nPCOS is a condition that affects about 510 percent of women of childbearing age. Women who have PCOS often are obese, have excess hair growth, and have reproductive problems and other health issues. These problems are caused by high levels of hormones called androgens.\\n                \\nMedicines\\n                \\nCertain medicines may cause you to gain weight. These medicines include some corticosteroids, antidepressants, and seizure medicines.\\n                \\nThese medicines can slow the rate at which your body burns calories, increase your appetite, or cause your body to hold on to extra water. All of these factors can lead to weight gain.\\n                \\nEmotional Factors\\n                \\nSome people eat more than usual when they're bored, angry, or stressed. Over time, overeating will lead to weight gain and may cause overweight or obesity.\\n                \\nSmoking\\n                \\nSome people gain weight when they stop smoking. One reason is that food often tastes and smells better after quitting smoking.\\n                \\nAnother reason is because nicotine raises the rate at which your body burns calories, so you burn fewer calories when you stop smoking. However, smoking is a serious health risk, and quitting is more important than possible weight gain.\\n                \\nAge\\n                \\nAs you get older, you tend to lose muscle, especially if you're less active. Muscle loss can slow down the rate at which your body burns calories. If you don't reduce your calorie intake as you get older, you may gain weight.\\n                \\nMidlife weight gain in women is mainly due to aging and lifestyle, but menopause also plays a role. Many women gain about 5 pounds during menopause and have more fat around the waist than they did before.\\n                \\nPregnancy\\n                \\nDuring pregnancy, women gain weight to support their babies growth and development. After giving birth, some women find it hard to lose the weight. This may lead to overweight or obesity, especially after a few pregnancies.\\n                \\nLack of Sleep\\n                \\nResearch shows that lack of sleep increases the risk of obesity. For example, one study of teenagers showed that with each hour of sleep lost, the odds of becoming obese went up. Lack of sleep increases the risk of obesity in other age groups as well.\\n                \\nPeople who sleep fewer hours also seem to prefer eating foods that are higher in calories and carbohydrates, which can lead to overeating, weight gain, and obesity.\\n                \\nSleep helps maintain a healthy balance of the hormones that make you feel hungry (ghrelin) or full (leptin). When you don't get enough sleep, your level of ghrelin goes up and your level of leptin goes down. This makes you feel hungrier than when you're well-rested.\\n                \\nSleep also affects how your body reacts to insulin, the hormone that controls your blood glucose (sugar) level. Lack of sleep results in a higher than normal blood sugar level, which may increase your risk for diabetes.\\n                \\nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Sleep Deprivation and Deficiency article.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283466.053393}
