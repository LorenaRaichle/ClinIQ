There are several types of acanthoma, including \"acantholytic\", \"epidermolytic\", \"clear cell\", and \"melanoacanthoma\".  Though most individuals have only one acanthoma, there have been rare reports of individuals who have developed many.  The exact cause of acanthoma is not known; it is sometimes called a benign tumor, and sometimes described as the result of inflammation.  Acanthomas are not considered dangerous and do not require treatment, but they may be removed for cosmetic reasons or to relieve any associated symptoms.', 'How might an acanthoma be treated? Acanthomas are considered benign, but treatment may be done for cosmetic reasons or to relieve any associated symptoms.  Because acanthomas are quite rare, there are no established guidelines for treatment.  Treatment may depend on the type, number, and location of acanthomas.  For example, a single acanthoma may be removed by surgery, whereas multiple acanthomas may be treated with cryosurgery or the use of the medication fluorouracil cream.', \"Myelomeningocele is the most severe form of spina bifida. It happens when parts of the spinal cord and nerves come through the open part of the spine. It causes nerve damage and other disabilities. Seventy to ninety percent of children with this condition also have too much fluid on their brains (hydrocephalus). This happens because fluid that protects the brain and spinal cord is unable to drain like it should. The fluid builds up, causing pressure and swelling. Without treatment, a persons head grows too big, and they may have brain damage. Other disorders of the spinal cord may be seen, including syringomyelia and hip dislocation. The cause of myelomeningocele is unknown. However, low levels of folic acid in a woman's body before and during early pregnancy is thought to play a part in this type of birth defect.\", 'What are the signs and symptoms of myelomeningocele? A baby born with a myelomeningocele may have a sac sticking out of the mid to lower back that the doctor cannot see through when shining a light behind it. Symptoms of this condition include:[5182] Loss of bladder or bowel control Partial or complete lack of sensation Partial or complete paralysis of the legs Weakness of the hips, legs, or feet Some individuals may have additional symptoms. Other symptoms include: Abnormal feet or legs, such as clubfoot. Build up of fluid inside the skull (hydrocephalus) Hair at the back part of the pelvis called the sacral area Dimpling of the sacral area Meningitis Chiari II malformation Twenty to 50 percent of children with myelomeningocele develop a condition called progressive tethering, or tethered cord syndrome. A part of the spinal cord becomes fastened to an immovable structuresuch as overlying membranes and vertebraecausing the spinal cord to become abnormally stretched and the vertebrae elongated with growth and movement. This condition can cause change in the muscle function of the legs, as well as changes in bowel and bladder function. Early surgery on the spinal cord may help the child to regain a normal level of functioning and prevent further neurological deterioration.']}"}, "time": 1746283461.395894}
