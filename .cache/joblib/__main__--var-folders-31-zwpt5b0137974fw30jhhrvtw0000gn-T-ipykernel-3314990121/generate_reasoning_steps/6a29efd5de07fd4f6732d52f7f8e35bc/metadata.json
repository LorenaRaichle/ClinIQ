They are living tissues that rebuild constantly throughout your life. During childhood and your teens, your body adds new bone faster than it removes old bone. After about age 20, you can lose bone faster than you make bone. To have strong bones when you are young, and to prevent bone loss when you are older, you need to get enough calcium, vitamin D, and exercise. You should also avoid smoking and drinking too much alcohol.    Bone diseases can make bones easy to break. Different kinds of bone problems include       - Low bone density and osteoporosis, which make your bones weak and more likely to break     - Osteogenesis imperfecta makes your bones brittle     - Paget's disease of bone makes them weak     - Bones can also develop cancer and infections    -  Other bone diseases, which are caused by poor nutrition, genetics, or problems with the rate of bone growth or rebuilding       NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases\", \"A cyst is a fluid-filled sac. In most cases a cyst on the ovary does no harm and goes away by itself. Most women have them sometime during their lives. Cysts are rarely cancerous in women under 50. Cysts sometimes hurt - but not always. Often, a woman finds out about a cyst when she has a pelvic exam.     If you're in your childbearing years or past menopause, have no symptoms, and have a fluid-filled cyst, you may choose to monitor the cyst. You may need surgery if you have pain, are past menopause or if the cyst does not go away. Birth control pills can help prevent new cysts.    A health problem that may involve ovarian cysts is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Women with PCOS can have high levels of male hormones, irregular or no periods and small ovarian cysts.    Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health\", 'Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis. It causes pain, swelling, and reduced motion in your joints. It can occur in any joint, but usually it affects your hands, knees, hips or spine.    Osteoarthritis breaks down the cartilage in your joints. Cartilage is the slippery tissue that covers the ends of bones in a joint. Healthy cartilage absorbs the shock of movement. When you lose cartilage, your bones rub together. Over time, this rubbing can permanently damage the joint.    Risk factors for osteoarthritis include       -  Being overweight    -  Getting older    -  Injuring a joint        No single test can diagnose osteoarthritis. Most doctors use several methods, including medical history, a physical exam, x-rays, or lab tests.    Treatments include exercise, medicines, and sometimes surgery.    NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'The bladder is a hollow organ in your lower abdomen that stores urine. Many conditions can affect your bladder. Some common ones are       - Cystitis - inflammation of the bladder, often from an infection    - Urinary incontinence - loss of bladder control    - Overactive bladder - a condition in which the bladder squeezes urine out at the wrong time    - Interstitial cystitis - a chronic problem that causes bladder pain and frequent, urgent urination    - Bladder cancer       Doctors diagnose bladder diseases using different tests. These include urine tests, x-rays, and an examination of the bladder wall with a scope called a cystoscope. Treatment depends on the cause of the problem. It may include medicines and, in severe cases, surgery.     NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases']}"}, "time": 1746283466.990149}
