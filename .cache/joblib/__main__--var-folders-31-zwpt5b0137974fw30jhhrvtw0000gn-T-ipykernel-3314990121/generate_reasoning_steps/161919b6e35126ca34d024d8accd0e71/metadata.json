They can come as pills, capsules, powders, drinks, and energy bars. Supplements do not have to go through the testing that drugs do.    Some supplements can play an important role in health. For example, calcium and vitamin D are important for keeping bones strong. Pregnant women can take the vitamin folic acid to prevent certain birth defects in their babies.    To take a supplement as safely as possible       - Tell your health care provider about any dietary supplements you use    - Do not take a bigger dose than the label recommends    - Check with your health care provider about the supplements you take if you are going to have any type of surgery    - Read trustworthy information about the supplement       NIH: National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements', 'Summary : A medical device is any product used to diagnose, cure, or treat a condition, or to prevent disease. They range from small and simple, like a blood glucose meter, to large and complicated, like a ventilator. You might use one at home or at work, or you may need one in a hospital.    To use medical devices safely       - Know how your device works. Keep instructions close by    - Understand and properly respond to device alarms    - Have a back-up plan and supplies in the event of an emergency    - Keep emergency numbers available and update them as needed    - Educate your family and caregivers about your device       Food and Drug Administration', 'Summary : When it comes to taking medicines, kids aren\\'t just small adults. For prescription medicines, there is a \"Pediatric\" section of the label. It says whether the medication has been studied for its effects on children. It also tells you what ages have been studied. Aside from drugs for fever or pain, most over-the-counter products haven\\'t actually been studied in children for effectiveness, safety, or dosing.    When you give medicine to your child, be sure you\\'re giving the right medicine and the right amount. Read and follow the label directions. Use the correct dosing device. If the label says two teaspoons and you\\'re using a dosing cup with ounces only, don\\'t guess. Get the proper measuring device. Don\\'t substitute another item, such as a kitchen spoon. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care provider before giving two medicines at the same time. That way, you can avoid a possible overdose or an unwanted interaction. Follow age and weight limit recommendations. If the label says don\\'t give to children under a certain age or weight, don\\'t do it.    Food and Drug Administration', \"Infertility is a term doctors use if a man hasn't been able to get a woman pregnant after at least one year of trying. Causes of male infertility include       - Physical problems with the testicles    - Blockages in the ducts that carry sperm    - Hormone problems    - A history of high fevers or mumps    - Genetic disorders    - Lifestyle or environmental factors       About a third of the time, infertility is because of a problem with the man. One third of the time, it is a problem with the woman. Sometimes no cause can be found.    If you suspect you are infertile, see your doctor. There are tests that may tell if you have fertility problems. When it is possible to find the cause, treatments may include medicines, surgery, or assisted reproductive technology. Happily, many couples treated for infertility are able to have babies.    NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development\"]}"}, "time": 1746283467.5050921}
