Any problem that affects your mouth can make it hard to eat, drink or even smile.     Some common mouth problems include       - Cold sores - painful sores on the lips and around the mouth, caused by a virus    - Canker sores - painful sores in the mouth, caused by bacteria or viruses    - Thrush - a yeast infection that causes white patches in your mouth     - Leukoplakia - white patches of excess cell growth on the cheeks, gums or tongue, common in smokers    - Dry mouth - a lack of enough saliva, caused by some medicines and certain diseases    - Gum or tooth problems    - Bad breath       Treatment for mouth disorders varies, depending on the problem. Keeping a clean mouth by brushing and flossing often is important.', 'Your toenails and fingernails protect the tissues of your toes and fingers. They are made up of layers of a hardened protein called keratin, which is also in your hair and skin. The health of your nails can be a clue to your overall health. Healthy nails are usually smooth and consistent in color. Specific types of nail discoloration and changes in growth rate can be signs of lung, heart, kidney, and liver diseases, as well as diabetes and anemia. White spots and vertical ridges are harmless.    Nail problems that sometimes require treatment include       - Bacterial and fungal infections    - Ingrown nails    - Tumors    - Warts       Keeping your nails clean, dry, and trimmed can help you avoid some problems. Do not remove the cuticle, which can cause infection.', 'The heart has an internal electrical system that controls the rhythm of the heartbeat. Problems can cause abnormal heart rhythms, called arrhythmias. There are many types of arrhythmia. During an arrhythmia, the heart can beat too fast, too slow, or it can stop beating. Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) occurs when the heart develops an arrhythmia that causes it to stop beating. This is different than a heart attack, where the heart usually continues to beat but blood flow to the heart is blocked.     There are many possible causes of SCA. They include coronary heart disease, physical stress, and some inherited disorders. Sometimes there is no known cause for the SCA.    Without medical attention, the person will die within a few minutes. People are less likely to die if they have early defibrillation. Defibrillation sends an electric shock to restore the heart rhythm to normal. You should give cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to a person having SCA until defibrillation can be done.    If you have had an SCA, an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) reduces the chance of dying from a second SCA.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', \"Summary : People in the U.S. are living longer than ever before. Many seniors live active and healthy lives. But there's no getting around one thing: as we age, our bodies and minds change. There are things you can do to stay healthy and active as you age.It is important to understand what to expect. Some changes may just be part of normal aging, while others may be a warning sign of a medical problem. It is important to know the difference, and to let your healthcare provider know if you have any concerns.    Having a healthy lifestyle can help you to deal with normal aging changes and make the most of your life.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283467.7932642}
