Symptoms can include fatigue, shortness of breath, gallstones, and yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice). Affected individuals can also have an enlarged spleen. Treatment is usually not necessary unless severe anemia occurs. Surgery to remove the spleen may decrease the rate of red blood cell damage.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Paris-Trousseau thrombocytopenia? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Paris-Trousseau thrombocytopenia. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the cardiovascular system 50% Cognitive impairment 50% Abnormal bleeding - Clinodactyly - Intellectual disability - Prolonged bleeding time - Ptosis - Pyloric stenosis - Radial deviation of finger - Sporadic - Thrombocytopenia - Trigonocephaly - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with hypothyroidism and ciliary dyskinesia is a rare condition characterized by alopecia (hair loss); nail dystrophy (abnormal development of the nails); ophthalmic (eye-related) complications; thyroid dysfunction (primary hypothyroidism); hypohidrosis; ephelides (freckles); enteropathy (disease of the intestine); and respiratory tract infections due to ciliary dyskinesia. These features have lead to the acronym ANOTHER syndrome as an alternative name for the condition. The gene that causes the condition is currently unknown but it is thought to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is generally symptomatic and supportive.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with hypothyroidism and ciliary dyskinesia?
