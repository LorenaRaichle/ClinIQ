Gas leaves the body when people burp through the mouth or pass gas through the anus*the opening at the end of the digestive tract where stool leaves the body.\\n                \\nEveryone has gas. Burping and passing gas are normal. Many people believe that they burp or pass gas too often and that they have too much gas. Having too much gas is rare.', 'Gas in the digestive tract is usually caused by swallowing air and the breakdown of certain foods in the large intestine.\\n                \\n*See the Pronunciation Guide for tips on how to say the underlined words.\\n                \\nYou typically swallow a small amount of air when you eat and drink.

This gas is passed through the anus.\\n                \\nNormally, few bacteria live in the small intestine. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is an increase in the number of bacteria or a change in the type of bacteria in the small intestine. These bacteria can produce excess gas and may also cause diarrhea and weight loss. SIBO is usually related to diseases or disorders that damage the digestive system or affect how it works, such as Crohns disease or diabetes.']}"}, "time": 1746283484.713218}
