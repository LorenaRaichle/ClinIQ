The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Lamellar ichthyosis. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal hair quantity 90% Abnormality of the eyelid 90% Abnormality of the nail 90% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the eyebrow 90% Dry skin 90% Hyperkeratosis 90% Ichthyosis 90% Lack of skin elasticity 90% Pruritus 90% Abnormality of the helix 50% Abnormality of the teeth 7.5% Cognitive impairment 7.5% Dehydration 7.5% Gangrene 7.5% Otitis media 7.5% Recurrent respiratory infections 7.5% Renal insufficiency 7.5% Sepsis 7.5% Short stature 7.5% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'How might lamellar ichthyosis be treated? Unfortunately, there is currently no cure for lamellar ichthyosis. Management is generally supportive and based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For infants, providing a moist environment in an isolette (incubator) and preventing infection are most important. Petrolatum-based creams and ointments are used to keep the skin soft, supple, and hydrated. As affected children become older, treatments to promote peeling and thinning of the stratum corneum (the outermost layer of skin cells) are often recommended. This may include humidification with long baths, lubrication, and keratolytic agents such as alpha-hydroxy acid or urea preparations. For people with ectropion (turning out of the eyelid), lubrication of the cornea with artificial tears or prescription ointments is helpful to prevent the cornea from drying out. Topical or oral retinoid therapy may be recommended for those with severe skin involvement; however, these medications can be associated with undesired side effects and are, therefore, generally prescribed with caution.', 'Chromosome 3p- syndrome is a rare chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is a missing copy of the genetic material located towards the end of the short arm (p) of chromosome 3. The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the exact size and location of the deletion and which genes are involved. Some affected people appear to have no features or mild features, while others are more severely affected. Common symptoms shared by many people with this deletion include poor growth, developmental delay, intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, autism spectrum disorder, an unusually small head (microcephaly), and poor muscle tone (hypotonia). Most cases are not inherited, but people can pass the deletion on to their children. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.', \"What are the signs and symptoms of Chromosome 3p- syndrome? The signs and symptoms of chromosome 3p- syndrome and the severity of the condition depend on the exact size and location of the deletion and which genes are involved. Some affected people appear to have no features or mild features, while others are more severely affected. Common symptoms shared by many people with this condition include: Growth problems both before and after birth Feeding difficulties Developmental delay Poor muscle tone (hypotonia) Intellectual disability Ptosis Distinctive facial features Microcephaly and/or unusual head shape Autism spectrum disorder Other features that may be seen include cleft palate; extra fingers and/or toes; gastrointestinal abnormalities; seizures; hearing impairment; kidney problems; and/or congenital heart defects. To read more about some of the signs and symptoms reported in people with 3p deletion syndrome, you can read Unique's disorder guide entitled '3p25 deletions.' The information in this guide is drawn partly from the published medical literature, and partly from Unique's database of members with a 3p deletion.
