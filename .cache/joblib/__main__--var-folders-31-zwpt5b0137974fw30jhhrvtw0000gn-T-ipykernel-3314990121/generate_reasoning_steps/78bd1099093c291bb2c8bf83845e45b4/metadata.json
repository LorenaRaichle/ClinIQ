Symptoms may vary, but often include an urgent or frequent need to urinate. Many of the individuals affected by IC are women. Because IC varies so much in symptoms and severity, most researchers believe it is not one, but several diseases. In recent years, scientists have started to use the terms bladder pain syndrome (BPS) or painful bladder syndrome (PBS) to describe cases with painful urinary symptoms that may not meet the strictest definition of IC. While there is no cure for IC/PBS, in many cases, the symptoms can be managed. Treatments include dietary and lifestyle changes; distending, or inflating, the bladder; bathing the inside of the bladder with a medicine solution; oral medicines and in rare cases, surgery.', 'Acrodysplasia scoliosis is a rare condition that has been reported in two brothers. The condition is characterized by scoliosis, brachydactyly (unusually short fingers and toes), spina bifida occulta, and carpal synostosis (fused bones of the wrist). The underlying genetic cause of the condition is unknown, but it appears to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Acrodysplasia scoliosis? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Acrodysplasia scoliosis. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Brachydactyly syndrome 90% Scoliosis 90% Spina bifida occulta 50% Vertebral segmentation defect 50% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Gray platelet syndrome (GPS) is a rare inherited bleeding disorder characterized by platelets that have a gray appearance, severe thrombocytopenia, myelofibrosis, and splenomegaly. About 60 cases from various populations around the world have been described in the literature to date. GPS results from the absence or reduction of alpha-granules in platelets, which store proteins that promote platelet adhesiveness and wound healing when secreted during an injury. GPS is caused by mutations in the NBEAL2 gene and inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.']}"}, "time": 1746283456.695359}
