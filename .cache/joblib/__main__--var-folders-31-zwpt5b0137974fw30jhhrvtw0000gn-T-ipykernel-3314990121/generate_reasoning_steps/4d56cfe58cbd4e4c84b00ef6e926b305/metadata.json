This is because narcolepsy is fairly rare. Also, many narcolepsy symptoms are like symptoms of other illnesses, such as infections, depression, and sleep disorders.\\n                \\nNarcolepsy sometimes is mistaken for learning problems, seizure disorders, or laziness, especially in school-aged children and teens. When narcolepsy symptoms are mild, the disorder is even harder to diagnose.\\n                \\nYour doctor will diagnose narcolepsy based on your signs and symptoms, your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and test results.\\n                \\nSigns and Symptoms\\n                \\nTell your doctor about any signs and symptoms of narcolepsy that you have. This is important because your doctor may not ask about them during a routine checkup.\\n                \\nYour doctor will want to know when you first had signs and symptoms and whether they bother your sleep or daily routine. He or she also will want to know about your sleep habits and how you feel and act during the day.\\n                \\nTo help answer these questions, you may want to keep a sleep diary for a few weeks. Keep a daily record of how easy it is to fall and stay asleep, how much sleep you get at night, and how alert you feel during the day.\\n                \\nFor a sample sleep diary, go to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\'s \"Your Guide to Healthy Sleep.\"\\n                \\nMedical and Family Histories\\n                \\nYour doctor may ask whether:\\n                \\nYou\\'re affected by certain factors that can lead to narcolepsy. Examples of these factors include infections, brain injuries, and autoimmune disorders. Some research suggests that environmental toxins may play a role in triggering narcolepsy.\\n                \\nYou take medicines and which ones you take. Some medicines can cause daytime sleepiness. Thus, your symptoms may be due to medicine, not narcolepsy.\\n                \\nYou have symptoms of other sleep disorders that cause daytime sleepiness.\\n                \\nYou have relatives who have narcolepsy or who have signs or symptoms of the disorder.\\n                \\nPhysical Exam\\n                \\nYour doctor will check you to see whether another condition is causing your symptoms. For example, infections, certain thyroid diseases, drug and alcohol use, and other medical or sleep disorders may cause symptoms similar to those of narcolepsy.\\n                \\nDiagnostic Tests\\n                \\nSleep Studies\\n                \\nIf your doctor thinks you have narcolepsy, he or she will likely suggest that you see a sleep specialist. This specialist may advise you to have sleep studies to find out more about your condition.\\n                \\nSleep studies usually are done at a sleep center. Doctors use the results from two tests to diagnose narcolepsy. These tests are a polysomnogram (PSG) and a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT).\\n                \\nPolysomnogram. You usually stay overnight at a sleep center for a PSG. The test records brain activity, eye movements, heart rate, and blood pressure. A PSG can help find out whether you:\\n                \\nFall asleep quickly\\n                \\nGo into rapid eye movement (REM) sleep soon after falling asleep\\n                \\nWake up often during the night\\n                \\nMultiple sleep latency test. This daytime sleep study measures how sleepy you are. It\\'s often done the day after a PSG. During the test, you\\'re asked to nap for 20minutes every 2 hours throughout the day. (You will nap a total of four or five times.)\\n                \\nA technician checks your brain activity during this time. He or she notes how quickly you fall asleep and how long it takes you to reach various stages of sleep.\\n                \\nAn MSLT finds out how quickly you fall asleep during the day (after a full night\\'s sleep). It also shows whether you go into REM sleep soon after falling asleep.\\n                \\nOther Tests\\n                \\nHypocretin test. This test measures the level of hypocretin in the fluid that surrounds your spinal cord. Most people who have narcolepsy have low levels of hypocretin. Hypocretin is a chemical that helps promote wakefulness.\\n                \\nTo get a sample of spinal cord fluid, a spinal tap (also called a lumbar puncture) is done. For this procedure, your doctor inserts a needle into your lower back area and then withdraws a sample of your spinal fluid.', 'Narcolepsy has no cure. However, medicines, lifestyle changes, and other therapies can relieve many of its symptoms. Treatment for narcolepsy is based on the type of symptoms you have and how severe they are.\\n                \\nNot all medicines and lifestyle changes work for everyone. It may take weeks to months for you and your doctor to find the best treatment.\\n                \\nMedicines\\n                \\nYou may need one or more medicines to treat narcolepsy symptoms. These may include:\\n                \\nStimulants to ease daytime sleepiness and raise your alertness.\\n                \\nA medicine that helps make up for the low levels of hypocretin in your brain. (Hypocretin is a chemical that helps promote wakefulness.) This medicine helps you stay awake during the day and sleep at night. It doesn\\'t always completely relieve daytime sleepiness, so your doctor may tell you to take it with a stimulant.\\n                \\nMedicines that help you sleep at night.\\n                \\nMedicines used to treat depression. These medicines also help prevent cataplexy, hallucinations, and sleep paralysis.\\n                \\nSome prescription and over-the-counter medicines can interfere with your sleep. Ask your doctor about these medicines and how to avoid them, if possible. For example, your doctor may advise you to avoid antihistamines. These medicines suppress the action of histamine, a substance in the blood that promotes wakefulness.\\n                \\nIf you take regular naps when you feel sleepy, you may need less medicine to stay awake.\\n                \\nLifestyle Changes\\n                \\nLifestyle changes also may help relieve some narcolepsy symptoms. You can take steps to make it easier to fall asleep at night and stay asleep.\\n                \\nFollow a regular sleep schedule. Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day.\\n                \\nDo something relaxing before bedtime, such as taking a warm bath.\\n                \\nKeep your bedroom or sleep area quiet, comfortable, dark, and free from distractions, such as a TV or computer.\\n                \\nAllow yourself about 20 minutes to fall asleep or fall back asleep after waking up. After that, get up and do something relaxing (like reading) until you get sleepy.\\n                \\nCertain activities, foods, and drinks before bedtime can keep you awake. Try to follow these guidelines:\\n                \\nExercise regularly, but not within 3 hours of bedtime.\\n                \\nAvoid tobacco, alcohol, chocolate, and drinks that contain caffeine for several hours before bedtime.\\n                \\nAvoid large meals and beverages just before bedtime.\\n                \\nAvoid bright lights before bedtime.\\n                \\nFor more tips on sleeping better, go to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\'s \"Your Guide to Healthy Sleep.\"\\n                \\nOther Therapies\\n                \\nLight therapy may help you keep a regular sleep and wake schedule. For this type of therapy, you sit in front of a light box, which has special lights, for 10 to 30 minutes. This therapy can help you feel less sleepy in the morning.', 'Espaol\\n                \\nDeep vein thrombosis (throm-BO-sis), or DVT, is a blood clot that forms in a vein deep in the body. Blood clots occur when blood thickens and clumps together.\\n                \\nMost deep vein blood clots occur in the lower leg or thigh. They also can occur in other parts of the body.\\n                \\nA blood clot in a deep vein can break off and travel through the bloodstream. The loose clot is called an embolus (EM-bo-lus). It can travel to an artery in the lungs and block blood flow. This condition is called pulmonary embolism (PULL-mun-ary EM-bo-lizm), or PE.\\n                \\nPE is a very serious condition. It can damage the lungs and other organs in the body and cause death.\\n                \\nBlood clots in the thighs are more likely to break off and cause PE than blood clots in the lower legs or other parts of the body.

Such factors include surgery, serious injuries, inflammation, and immune responses.\\n                \\nBlood flow is sluggish or slow. Lack of motion can cause sluggish or slow blood flow. This may occur after surgery, if you're ill and in bed for a long time, or if you're traveling for a long time.\\n                \\nYour blood is thicker or more likely to clot than normal. Some inherited conditions (such as factor V Leiden) increase the risk of blood clotting. Hormone therapy or birth control pills also can increase the risk of clotting.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283466.226901}
