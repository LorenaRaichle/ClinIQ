Clinical trials are part of the research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way disease will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\\n                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose tumors have not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop tumors from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.\", 'Key Points\\n                    - Chronic myelogenous leukemia is a disease in which the bone marrow makes too many white blood cells.    - Leukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.    - Signs and symptoms of chronic myelogenous leukemia include fever, night sweats, and tiredness.     - Most people with CML have a gene mutation (change) called the Philadelphia chromosome.    - Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect (find) and diagnose chronic myelogenous leukemia.    - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Chronic myelogenous leukemia is a disease in which the bone marrow makes too many white blood cells.\\n                    Chronic myelogenous leukemia (also called CML or chronic granulocytic leukemia) is a slowly progressing blood and bone marrow disease that usually occurs during or after middle age, and rarely occurs in children.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Leukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\\n                    Normally, the bone marrow makes blood stem cells (immature cells) that become mature blood cells over time. A blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell. A lymphoid stem cell becomes a white blood cell.    A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells:         -  Red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body.    -  Platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding.    -  Granulocytes (white blood cells) that fight infection and disease.         In CML, too many blood stem cells become a type of white blood cell called granulocytes. These granulocytes are abnormal and do not become healthy white blood cells. They are also called leukemia cells. The leukemia cells can build up in the blood and bone marrow so there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. When this happens, infection, anemia, or easy bleeding may occur.   This summary is about chronic myelogenous leukemia. See the following PDQ summaries for more information about leukemia:          -  Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment     -  Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment     -  Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment     -  Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia/Other Myeloid Malignancies Treatment     -  Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Treatment     -  Hairy Cell Leukemia Treatment', 'Signs and symptoms of chronic myelogenous leukemia include fever, night sweats, and tiredness. These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by CML or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:         - Feeling very tired.    - Weight loss for no known reason.    - Night sweats.    -  Fever.    - Pain or a feeling of fullness below the ribs on the left side.        Sometimes CML does not cause any symptoms at all.', 'Most people with CML have a gene mutation (change) called the Philadelphia chromosome. Every cell in the body contains DNA (genetic material) that determines how the cell looks and acts. DNA is contained inside chromosomes. In CML, part of the DNA from one chromosome moves to another chromosome. This change is called the  Philadelphia chromosome. It results in the bone marrow making an enzyme, called tyrosine kinase, that causes too many stem cells to become white blood cells (granulocytes or blasts).   The Philadelphia chromosome is not passed from parent to child.']}"}, "time": 1746283464.943529}
