Wilson disease is present at birth; however, the signs and symptoms of the disease do not appear until the copper builds up in the liver, the brain, or other organs.\\n                \\nWhen people have signs and symptoms, they usually affect the liver, the central nervous system, or both. The central nervous system includes the brain, the spinal cord, and nerves throughout the body. Sometimes a person does not have symptoms and a health care provider discovers the disease during a routine physical exam or blood test, or during an illness. Children can have Wilson disease for several years before any signs and symptoms occur. People with Wilson disease may have\\n                \\n- liver-related signs and symptoms  - central nervous system-related signs and symptoms  - mental health-related signs and symptoms  - other signs and symptoms\\n                \\nLiver-related Signs and Symptoms\\n                \\nPeople with Wilson disease may develop signs and symptoms of chronic, or long lasting, liver disease:\\n                \\n- weakness  - fatigue, or feeling tired  - loss of appetite  - nausea  - vomiting  - weight loss  - pain and bloating from fluid accumulating in the abdomen  - edemaswelling, usually in the legs, feet, or ankles and less often in the hands or face  - itching  - spiderlike blood vessels, called spider angiomas, near the surface of the skin  - muscle cramps  - jaundice, a condition that causes the skin and whites of the eyes to turn yellow\\n                \\nSome people with Wilson disease may not develop signs or symptoms of liver disease until they develop acute liver failurea condition that develops suddenly.\\n                \\nCentral Nervous System-related Signs and Symptoms\\n                \\nCentral nervous system-related symptoms usually appear in people after the liver has retained a lot of copper; however, signs and symptoms of liver disease may not be present. Central nervous system-related symptoms occur most often in adults and sometimes occur in children.1 Signs and symptoms include\\n                \\n- tremors or uncontrolled movements  - muscle stiffness  - problems with speech, swallowing, or physical coordination\\n                \\nA health care provider may refer people with these symptoms to a neurologista doctor who specializes in nervous system diseases.\\n                \\nMental Health-related Signs and Symptoms\\n                \\nSome people will have mental health-related signs and symptoms when copper builds up in the central nervous system. Signs and symptoms may include\\n                \\n- personality changes  - depression  - feeling anxious, or nervous, about most things  - psychosiswhen a person loses contact with reality\\n                \\nOther Signs and Symptoms\\n                \\nOther signs and symptoms of Wilson disease may include\\n                \\n- anemia, a condition in which red blood cells are fewer or smaller than normal, which prevents the bodys cells from getting enough oxygen  - arthritis, a condition in which a person has pain and swelling in one or more joints  - high levels of amino acids, protein, uric acid, and carbohydrates in urine  - low platelet or white blood cell count  - osteoporosis, a condition in which the bones become less dense and more likely to fracture', 'People who have Wilson disease that is not treated or diagnosed early can have serious complications, such as\\n                \\n- cirrhosisscarring of the liver  - kidney damageas liver function decreases, the kidneys may be damaged  - persistent nervous system problems when nervous system symptoms do not resolve  - liver cancerhepatocellular carcinoma is a type of liver cancer that can occur in people with cirrhosis  - liver failurea condition in which the liver stops working properly  - death, if left untreated', 'A health care provider may use several tests and exams to diagnose Wilson disease, including the following:\\n                \\n- medical and family history  - physical exam  - blood tests  - urine tests  - liver biopsy  - imaging tests\\n                \\nHealth care providers typically see the same symptoms of Wilson disease in other conditions, and the symptoms of Wilson disease do not occur together often, making the disease difficult to diagnose.\\n                \\nMedical and Family History\\n                \\nA health care provider may take a medical and family history to help diagnose Wilson disease.\\n                \\nPhysical Exam\\n                \\nA physical exam may help diagnose Wilson disease. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually\\n                \\n- examines a patients body  - uses a stethoscope to listen to sounds related to the abdomen\\n                \\nA health care provider will use a special light called a slit lamp to look for Kayser-Fleischer rings in the eyes.\\n                \\nBlood Tests\\n                \\nA nurse or technician will draw blood samples at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and send the samples to a lab for analysis. A health care provider may\\n                \\n- perform liver enzyme or function testsblood tests that may indicate liver abnormalities.  - check copper levels in the blood. Since the copper is deposited into the organs and is not circulating in the blood, most people with Wilson disease have a lower-than-normal level of copper in the blood. In cases of acute liver failure caused by Wilson disease, the level of blood copper is often higher than normal.  - check the level of ceruloplasmina protein that carries copper in the bloodstream. Most people with Wilson disease have a lower-than-normal ceruloplasmin level.  - conduct genetic testing. A health care provider may recommend genetic testing in cases of a known family history of Wilson disease.\\n                \\nUrine Tests\\n                \\n24-hour urine collection. A patient will collect urine at home in a special container provided by a health care providers office or a commercial facility. A health care provider sends the sample to a lab for analysis. A 24-hour urine collection will show increased copper in the urine in most patients who have symptoms due to Wilson disease.\\n                \\nLiver Biopsy\\n                \\nA liver biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a small piece of liver tissue for examination with a microscope for signs of damage or disease. The health care provider may ask the patient to stop taking certain medications temporarily before the liver biopsy. He or she may also ask the patient to fasteat or drink nothingfor 8 hours before the procedure.\\n                \\nDuring the procedure, the patient lies on a table, right hand resting above the head. The health care provider applies a local anesthetic to the area where he or she will insert the biopsy needle. If needed, a health care provider will also give sedatives and pain medication. The health care provider uses the needle to take a small piece of liver tissue. He or she may use ultrasound, computerized tomography scans, or other imaging techniques to guide the needle. After the biopsy, the patient must lie on the right side for up to 2 hours and is monitored an additional 2 to 4 hours before being sent home.\\n                \\nA pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseasesexamines the liver tissue in a lab. The test can show cirrhosis of the liver. Sometimes the liver biopsy will show copper buildup in the liver cells; however, the results can vary because the copper does not always deposit evenly into the liver. Therefore, health care providers often find it more useful to analyze a piece of liver tissue for copper content. Most patients with Wilson disease have high levels of copper in the liver tissue when compared with carriers or with people who do not have Wilson disease.\\n                \\nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Liver Biopsy.\\n                \\nImaging Tests\\n                \\nA health care provider may order imaging tests to evaluate brain abnormalities in patients who have nervous system symptoms often seen with Wilson disease, or in patients diagnosed with Wilson disease. Health care providers do not use brain imaging tests to diagnose Wilson disease, though certain findings may suggest the patient has the disease.\\n                \\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI is a test that takes pictures of the bodys internal organs and soft tissues without using x rays. A specially trained technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images. The patient does not need anesthesia, though people with a fear of confined spaces may receive light sedation, taken by mouth. An MRI may include the injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. With most MRI machines, the patient will lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that may be open ended or closed at one end. Some machines allow the patient to lie in a more open space. The technician will take a sequence of images from different angles to create a detailed picture of the brain. During sequencing, the patient will hear loud mechanical knocking and humming noises. MRI can show if other diseases or conditions are causing the patients neurological symptoms.\\n                \\nComputerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan uses a combination of x rays and computer technology to create images. For a CT scan, a health care provider may give the patient a solution to drink and an injection of contrast medium. CT scans require the patient to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where a technician takes the x rays. An x-ray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital. A radiologist interprets the images. The patient does not need anesthesia. A CT scan can show if other diseases or conditions are causing the patients neurological symptoms.', 'A health care provider will treat Wilson disease with a lifelong effort to reduce and control the amount of copper in the body. Treatment may include\\n                \\n- medications  - changes in eating, diet, and nutrition  - a liver transplant\\n                \\nMedications\\n                \\nA health care provider will prescribe medications to treat Wilson disease. The medications have different actions that health care providers use during different phases of the treatment.\\n                \\nChelating agents. Chelating agents are medications that remove extra copper from the body by releasing it from organs into the bloodstream. Once the cooper is in the bloodstream, the kidneys then filter the copper and pass it into the urine. A health care provider usually recommends chelating agents at the beginning of treatment. A potential side effect of chelating agents is that nervous system symptoms may become worse during treatment. The two medications available for this type of treatment include\\n                \\n- trientine (Syprine)the risk for side effects and worsening nervous system symptoms appears to be lower with trientine than d-penicillamine. Researchers are still studying the side effects; however, some health care providers prefer to prescribe trientine as the first treatment of choice because it appears to be safer.  - d-penicillaminepeople taking d-penicillamine may have other reactions or side effects, such as      - fever    - a rash    - kidney problems    - bone marrow problems\\n                \\nA health care provider will prescribe a lower dose of a chelating agent to women who are pregnant to reduce the risk of birth defects. A health care provider should consider future screening on any newborn whose parent has Wilson disease.\\n                \\nZinc. A health care provider will prescribe zinc for patients who do not have symptoms, or after a person has completed successful treatment using a chelating agent and symptoms begin to improve. Zinc, taken by mouth as zinc salts such as zinc acetate (Galzin), blocks the digestive tracts absorption of copper from food. Although most people taking zinc usually do not experience side effects, some people may experience stomach upset. A health care provider may prescribe zinc for children with Wilson disease who show no symptoms. Women may take the full dosage of zinc safely during pregnancy.\\n                \\nMaintenance, or long term, treatment begins when symptoms improve and tests show that copper is at a safe level. Maintenance treatment typically includes taking zinc or a lower dose of a chelating agent. A health care provider closely monitors the person and reviews regular blood and urine tests to ensure maintenance treatment controls the copper level in the body.\\n                \\nTreatment for people with Wilson disease who have no symptoms may include a chelating agent or zinc in order to prevent symptoms from developing and stop or slow disease progression.\\n                \\nPeople with Wilson disease will take medications for the rest of their lives. Follow-up and adherence to the health care providers treatment plan is necessary to manage symptoms and prevent organ damage.']}"}, "time": 1746283485.264802}
