This sac is called the pericardium (per-i-KAR-de-um).\\n                \\nThe pericardium holds the heart in place and helps it work properly. The sac is made of two thin layers of tissue that enclose your heart. Between the two layers is a small amount of fluid. This fluid keeps the layers from rubbing against each other and causing friction.\\n                \\nPericardium\\n                \\n\\n                \\nIn pericarditis, the layers of tissue become inflamed and can rub against the heart. This causes chest pain, a common symptom of pericarditis.\\n                \\nThe chest pain from pericarditis may feel like pain from a heart attack. More often, the pain may be sharp and get worse when you inhale, and improve when you are sitting up and leaning forward. If you have chest pain, you should call 911 right away, as you may be having a heart attack.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nIn many cases, the cause of pericarditis is unknown. Viral infections are likely a common cause of pericarditis, although the virus may never be found. Bacterial, fungal, and other infections also can cause pericarditis.\\n                \\nOther possible causes include heart attack or heart surgery, other medical conditions, injuries, and certain medicines.\\n                \\nPericarditis can be acute or chronic. \"Acute\" means that it occurs suddenly and usually doesn\\'t last long. \"Chronic\" means that it develops over time and may take longer to treat.\\n                \\nBoth acute and chronic pericarditis can disrupt your heart\\'s normal rhythm or function and possibly (although rarely) lead to death. However, most cases of pericarditis are mild; they clear up on their own or with rest and simple treatment.\\n                \\nOther times, more intense treatments are needed to prevent complications. Treatments may include medicines and, less often, procedures or surgery.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nIt may take from a few days to weeks or even months to recover from pericarditis. With proper and prompt treatment, such as rest and ongoing care, most people fully recover from pericarditis. Proper treatment also can help reduce the chance of getting the condition again.', \"In many cases, the cause of pericarditis (both acute and chronic) is unknown.\\n                \\nViral infections are likely a common cause of pericarditis, although the virus may never be found. Pericarditis often occurs after a respiratory infection. Bacterial, fungal, and other infections also can cause pericarditis.\\n                \\nMost cases of chronic, or recurring, pericarditis are thought to be the result of autoimmune disorders. Examples of such disorders include lupus, scleroderma, and rheumatoid arthritis.\\n                \\nWith autoimmune disorders, the body's immune system makes antibodies (proteins) that mistakenly attack the body's tissues or cells.\\n                \\nOther possible causes of pericarditis are:\\n                \\nHeart attack and heart surgery\\n                \\nKidney failure, HIV/AIDS, cancer, tuberculosis, and other health problems\\n                \\nInjuries from accidents or radiation therapy\\n                \\nCertain medicines, like phenytoin (an antiseizure medicine), warfarin and heparin (blood-thinning medicines), and procainamide (a medicine to treat irregular heartbeats)\", 'Pericarditis occurs in people of all ages. However, men aged 20 to 50 are more likely to develop it than others.\\n                \\nPeople who are treated for acute pericarditis may get it again. This may happen in 15 to 30 percent of people who have the condition. A small number of these people go on to develop chronic pericarditis.', \"The most common sign of acute pericarditis is sharp, stabbing chest pain. The pain usually comes on quickly. It often is felt in the middle or left side of the chest or over the front of the chest. You also may feel pain in one or both shoulders, the neck, back, and abdomen.\\n                \\nThe pain tends to ease when you sit up and lean forward. Lying down and deep breathing worsens it. For some people, the pain feels like a dull ache or pressure in the chest.\\n                \\nThe chest pain also may feel like pain from a heart attack. If you have chest pain, you should call 911 right away, as you may be having a heart attack.\\n                \\nSome people with acute pericarditis develop a fever. Other symptoms are weakness, palpitations, trouble breathing, and coughing. (Palpitations are feelings that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, or beating too hard or too fast.)\\n                \\nThe most common symptom of chronic pericarditis is chest pain. Chronic pericarditis also often causes tiredness, coughing, and shortness of breath. Severe cases of chronic pericarditis can lead to swelling in the stomach and legs and hypotension (low blood pressure).\\n                \\nComplications of Pericarditis\\n                \\nTwo serious complications of pericarditis are cardiac tamponade (tam-po-NAD) and chronic constrictive pericarditis.\\n                \\nCardiac tamponade occurs if too much fluid collects in the pericardium (the sac around the heart). The extra fluid puts pressure on the heart. This prevents the heart from properly filling with blood. As a result, less blood leaves the heart, which causes a sharp drop in blood pressure. If left untreated, cardiac tamponade can be fatal.\\n                \\nChronic constrictive pericarditis is a rare disease that develops over time. It leads to scar-like tissue forming throughout the pericardium. The sac becomes stiff and can't move properly. In time, the scarred tissue compresses the heart and prevents it from working well.\"]}"}, "time": 1746283465.740642}
