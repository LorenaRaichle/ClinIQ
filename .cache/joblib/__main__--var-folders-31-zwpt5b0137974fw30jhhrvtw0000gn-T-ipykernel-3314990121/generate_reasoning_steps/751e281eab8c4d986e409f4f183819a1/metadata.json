Baylisascaris infection in humans is uncommon but can be severe. While Baylisascaris can infect different types of animals, Baylisascaris procyonis, carried by raccoons, is thought to pose the greatest risk to humans because raccoons often live in close proximity to humans. Humans can acquire the parasite by ingesting the eggs of infected raccoons. Young children are at greatest risk for Baylisascaris infection because they are more likely to put contaminated soil in their mouths. Though rare, human infections can be severe if the parasite invades the eye (ocular larva migrans), organs (visceral larva migrans), or the brain (neural larva migrans). Symptoms of a Baylisascaris infection may include nausea, fatigue, an enlarged liver, loss of coordination, lack of muscle control, blindness, and coma. Baylisascaris infections cannot be spread from one person to another. No drug has been found to be completely effective against Baylisascaris infections in humans though albendazole has been used in some cases.', 'How might Baylisascaris infection be treated? No drug has been found to be completely effective in treating Baylisascaris infections in humans. Albendazole is currently considered to be the drug of choice. Corticosteroids may also be given to reduce inflammation. In many cases, significant damage has already occurred by the time treatment has started. Early diagnosis and treatment provide the best chance of recovery.', '2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is a metabolic disorder in which individuals lack adequate levels of an enzyme called 2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase. This enzyme assists in the processing of a particular amino acid called isoleucine. The inability to process isoleucine correctly leads to the buildup of the amino acid in the body.  The buildup can cause a variety of health problems, which vary widely from severe and life-threatening to mild or absent.  Signs and symptoms of the disorder can begin a few days after birth or later in childhood.  The initial symptoms often include poor feeding, lack of energy, vomiting, and irritability.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of 2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for 2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Apneic episodes in infancy - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Exotropia - Generalized amyotrophy - Hypoglycemia - Hypothermia - Infantile onset - Lethargy - Microcephaly - Motor delay - Muscular hypotonia - Seizures - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.']}"}, "time": 1746283457.895798}
