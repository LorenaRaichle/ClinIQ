Although scurvy is relatively rare in the United States, it continues to be a problem in malnourished populations around the world (such as impoverished, underdeveloped third world countries). Early features of the condition include general weakness, fatigue and aching limbs. If left untreated, more serious problems can develop such as anemia, gum disease, and skin hemorrhages. Symptoms generally develop after at least 3 months of severe or total vitamin C deficiency. Treatment consists of vitamin C supplements taken by mouth.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Scurvy? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Scurvy. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of metabolism/homeostasis - Autosomal recessive inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Selective IgM deficiency or \"Selective Immunoglobulin M deficiency (SIgMD) is a rare immune disorder that has been reported in association with serious infections, such as bacteremia. The disorder can occur in babies, children, and adults. It is characterized by isolated absence or deficiency of IgM, normal levels of other immunoglobulins and recurrent infections (especially by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenza). The cause is still unclear. The diagnosis includes the isolated deficiency of IgM in the blood and no other immunodeficiency or secondary cause of low IgM. Patients with SIgMD and recurrent infections are managed like other antibody defects and deficiencies. It is suggested to have pneumococcal and meningococcal vaccines, prophylactic antibiotics to patients who have recurrent infections and immune globulin replacement.', 'Centronuclear myopathy refers to a group of rare, inherited conditions that affect the muscles. There are three main forms of the condition that are differentiated by their pattern of inheritance: X-linked Myotubular Myopathy Autosomal Dominant Centronuclear Myopathy Autosomal Recessive Centronuclear Myopathy The cause of the condition and the associated signs and symptoms vary by subtype.

Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person and may include physical and/or occupational therapy and assistive devices to help with mobility, eating and/or breathing.']}"}, "time": 1746283456.851024}
