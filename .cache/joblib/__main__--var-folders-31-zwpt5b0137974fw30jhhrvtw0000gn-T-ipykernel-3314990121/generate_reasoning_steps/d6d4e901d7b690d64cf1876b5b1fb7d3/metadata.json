Treatment for essential tremor may not be necessary unless the tremors interfere with daily activities or cause embarrassment. Although there is no definitive cure for essential tremor, medicines may help relieve symptoms. How well medicines work depend on the individual patient. Two medications used to treat tremors include: Propranolol, a drug that blocks the action of stimulating substances called neurotransmitters, particularly those related to adrenaline Primidone, an antiseizure drug that also control the function of some neurotransmitters These drugs can have significant side effects. Eliminating tremor \"triggers\" such as caffeine and other stimulants from the diet is often recommended. Physical therapy may help to reduce tremor and improve coordination and muscle control for some patients.   More details about the management of essential tremor can be accessed through the following web links: http://www.mayoclinic.com/print/essential-tremor/DS00367/METHOD=print&DSECTION=all  http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1150290-treatment', 'Oculocutaneous albinism type 2 is a genetic condition that affects the coloring (pigmentation) of the skin, hair, and eyes. Affected individuals typically have very fair skin and white or light-colored hair. Long-term sun exposure greatly increases the risk of skin damage and skin cancers, including an aggressive form of skin cancer called melanoma, in people with this condition. This condition also reduces pigmentation of the colored part of the eye (the iris) and the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina). People with this condition usually have vision problems such as reduced sharpness; nystagmus and strabismus; and increased sensitivity to light (photophobia). This condition is caused by mutations in the OCA2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Oculocutaneous albinism type 2? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Oculocutaneous albinism type 2. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Ocular albinism 90% Freckling 50% Nystagmus 50% Optic atrophy 50% Photophobia 50% Visual impairment 50% Melanoma 7.5% Neoplasm of the skin 7.5% Strabismus 7.5% Albinism - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Blue irides - Freckles in sun-exposed areas - Hypopigmentation of the fundus - Hypoplasia of the fovea - Red hair - Reduced visual acuity - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Myhre syndrome is a rare inherited disorder characterized by intellectual disability, short stature, unusual facial features, and various bone (skeletal) abnormalities. Other findings may include hearing impairment, abnormal enlargement of the muscles (muscle hypertrophy), and/or joint stiffness. Myhre syndrome is caused by mutations in the SMAD4 gene. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Most cases are due to a new mutation.']}"}, "time": 1746283455.756245}
