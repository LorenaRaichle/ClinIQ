A health care provider may prescribe people who have Zollinger-Ellison syndrome higher-than-normal doses of PPIs to control the acid production. Studies show that PPIs may increase the risk of hip, wrist, and spine fractures when a person takes them long term or in high doses, so its important for people to discuss risks versus benefits with their health care provider.\\n                \\nSurgery\\n                \\nSurgical removal of gastrinomas is the only cure for Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Some gastrinomas spread to other parts of the body, especially the liver and bones. Finding and removing all gastrinomas before they spread is often challenging because many of the tumors are small.\\n                \\nChemotherapy\\n                \\nHealth care providers sometimes use chemotherapy drugs to treat gastrinomas that cannot be surgically removed, including\\n                \\n- streptozotocin (Zanosar)  - 5-fluorouracil (Adrucil)  - doxorubicin (Doxil)', 'Researchers have not found that eating, diet, and nutrition play a role in causing or preventing Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.', '- Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is a rare disorder that occurs when one or more tumors form in the pancreas and duodenum.  - Experts do not know the exact cause of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.  - About 25 to 30 percent of gastrinomas are caused by an inherited genetic disorder called multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1).  - Although anyone can get Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, the disease is more common among men 30 to 50 years old.  - Zollinger-Ellison syndrome signs and symptoms are similar to those of peptic ulcers.  - Some people with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome have only diarrhea, with no other symptoms. Others develop gastroesophageal reflux (GER).  - A health care provider diagnoses Zollinger-Ellison syndrome based on the following:      - medical history    - physical exam    - signs and symptoms    - blood tests    - upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy    - imaging tests to look for gastrinomas    - measurement of stomach acid    - A health care provider treats Zollinger-Ellison syndrome with medications to reduce gastric acid secretion and with surgery to remove gastrinomas.
