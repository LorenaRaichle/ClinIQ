The aims of treatment are to remove sources of infection or pain, restore aesthetics and protect posterior teeth from wear. Treatment varies according to the age of the patient, severity of the problem and the presenting complaint. Crowns, caps or other forms of dental care are the most commonly used treatments. Dentures or dental implants may be necessary if the majority of teeth are lost. More detailed information regarding the treatment of dentinogenesis imperfecta can be found by visiting the following web links: https://www.dentistry.unc.edu/dentalprofessionals/resources/defects/di/ http://www.ojrd.com/content/3/1/31', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Ataxia with Oculomotor Apraxia Type 2? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Ataxia with Oculomotor Apraxia Type 2. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Impaired distal tactile sensation 57% Tremor 57% Strabismus 30% Conjunctival telangiectasia 5% Areflexia 10/10 Cerebellar atrophy 8/8 Distal amyotrophy 10/10 Distal muscle weakness 10/10 Dysarthria 10/10 Dysphagia 10/10 Elevated alpha-fetoprotein 6/6 Gait ataxia 10/10 Impaired proprioception 10/10 Peripheral axonal neuropathy 8/8 Nystagmus 8/10 Pes cavus 12/18 Oculomotor apraxia 10/18 Scoliosis 7/18 Dystonia 5/18 Head tremor 5/19 Chorea 4/18 Hyporeflexia 4/18 Abnormal pyramidal signs - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Decreased motor nerve conduction velocity - Elevated serum creatine phosphokinase - Gaze-evoked nystagmus - Impaired distal vibration sensation - Increased antibody level in blood - Limb ataxia - Polyneuropathy - Pontocerebellar atrophy - Progressive - Progressive gait ataxia - Saccadic smooth pursuit - Variable expressivity - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Temporomandibular ankylosis is a condition that occurs when the temporomandibular joint (the joint that connects the jaw to the side of the head) becomes fused by bony or fibrous tissue. As a result, affected people may experience pain, speech impairment, and difficulty chewing and swallowing. It can interfere with nutrition, oral hygiene and the normal growth of the face and/or jaw. Although the condition can be diagnosed in people of all ages, it generally occurs during the first and second decades of life. Temporomandibular ankylosis is most commonly caused by trauma or infection; it may also be associated with certain conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, or psoriasis. The condition is typically treated surgically.', 'Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) is a form of migraine headache that runs in families. Migraines usually cause intense, throbbing pain in one area of the head, often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to light and sound. These recurrent headaches typically begin in childhood or adolescence and may last from a few hours to a few days. People with familial hemiplegic migraine experience an aura that comes before the headache. The most common symptoms associated with an aura are temporary visual changes such as blind spots (scotomas), flashing lights, zig-zagging lines, and double vision. In people with familial hemiplegic migraine, auras are also characterized by temporary numbness or weakness, often affecting one side of the body (hemiparesis). An aura typically develops gradually over a few minutes and lasts about an hour. Researchers have identified three forms of familial hemiplegic migraine known as FHM1, FHM2, and FHM3. Each of the three types is caused by mutations in a different gene.']}"}, "time": 1746283459.3214982}
