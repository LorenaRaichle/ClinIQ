Shapiro syndrome generally consists of three findings: spontaneous periodic hypothermia, excessive sweating, and agenesis of the corpus callosum. However, there has been a documented case of a 4-year-old girl with Shapiro syndrome who did not have agenesis of the corpus callosum. Additionally, there have been some patients who also produce excessive amounts of urine  (polyuria) and have experienced excessive thirst (polydipsia).  Given that some people with Shapiro syndrome do not respond well to the various treatment options available for the condition, the symptoms may worsen with time for some people.   The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Shapiro syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Gait disturbance 90% Hyperhidrosis 90% Hypothermia 90% Incoordination 90% Nausea and vomiting 90% Pallor 90% Arrhythmia 50% Reduced consciousness/confusion 50% Seizures 50% Sleep disturbance 50% Tremor 50% Abnormal pattern of respiration 7.5% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the corpus callosum 7.5% Diarrhea 7.5% Skin rash 7.5% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', \"What treatment options have been attempted for Shapiro syndrome? Evaluating effective treatment options for Shapiro syndrome can be difficult because of the limited number of diagnosed cases, the periodic nature of the disease, and other factors. Nonetheless, the following have been attempted and have resulted in varying responses: anticonvulsants, clonidine, cyproheptadine, glycopyrrolate, bromocriptine, chlorpromazine, or sympathectomy. It is recommended that treatment options be discussed with a health care provider. Only a patient's health care provider can determine the appropriate course of treatment.\", 'Hypotrichosis-lymphedema-telangiectasia syndrome (HLTS) is a rare condition that, as the name suggests, is associated with sparse hair (hypotrichosis), lymphedema, and telangiectasia, particularly on the palms of the hands. Symptoms usually begin at birth or in early childhood and become worse over time. HLTS is thought to be caused by changes (mutations) in the SOX18 gene. It can follow both an autosomal dominant or an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, depending on the affected family. There is currently no cure for the condition. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Hypotrichosis-lymphedema-telangiectasia syndrome?
