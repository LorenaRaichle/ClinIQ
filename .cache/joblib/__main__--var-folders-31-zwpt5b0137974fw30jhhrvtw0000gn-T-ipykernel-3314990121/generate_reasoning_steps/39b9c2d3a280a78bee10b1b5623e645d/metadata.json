The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Kallmann syndrome 3. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Hearing impairment 5% Seizures 5% Anosmia - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Cleft palate - Cleft upper lip - Cryptorchidism - Hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism - Hypotelorism - Micropenis - Pectus excavatum - Pes planus - Primary amenorrhea - Unilateral renal agenesis - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Congenital short femur is a rare type of skeletal dysplasia, a complex group of bone and cartilage disorders that affect the skeleton of a fetus as it develops during pregnancy. Congenital short femur can vary in severity, ranging from hypoplasia (underdevelopment) of the femur to absence of the femur. With modern surgery techniques and expertise, lengthening the shortened femur may be an option for some patients. However surgical lengthening of the femur remains a challenging procedure with risks for complications.', 'Chromosome 16p13.3 deletion syndrome is a chromosome abnormality that can affect many parts of the body. People with this condition are missing a small piece (deletion) of chromosome 16 at a location designated p13.3. Although once thought to be a severe form of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, it is now emerging as a unique syndrome. Signs and symptoms may include failure to thrive, hypotonia (reduced muscle tone), short stature, microcephaly (unusually small head), characteristic facial features, mild to moderate intellectual disability, serious organ anomalies (i.e. heart and/or kidney problems), and vulnerability to infections. Chromosome testing of both parents can provide more information on whether or not the deletion was inherited. In most cases, parents do not have any chromosomal anomaly. However, sometimes one parent has a balanced translocation where a piece of a chromosome has broken off and attached to another one with no gain or loss of genetic material. The balanced translocation normally does not cause any signs or symptoms, but it increases the risk for having an affected child with a chromosomal anomaly like a deletion. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.
