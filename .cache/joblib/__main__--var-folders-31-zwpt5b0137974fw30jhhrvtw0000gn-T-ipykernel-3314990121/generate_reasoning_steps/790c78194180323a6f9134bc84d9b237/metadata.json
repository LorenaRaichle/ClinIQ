The exact cause of Ollier disease is not known. It is usually a sporadic, non-familial disorder, however, in some cases, it may be inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic trait.', 'How might Ollier disease be treated? There is no specific medical treatment for Ollier disease. Surgery is indicated in cases where complications (pathological fractures, growth defect, malignant transformation) arise.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Glycosylphosphatidylinositol deficiency? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Glycosylphosphatidylinositol deficiency. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal recessive inheritance - Hepatomegaly - Portal hypertension - Portal vein thrombosis - Seizures - Splenomegaly - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Wildervanck syndrome is a condition that occurs almost exclusively in females and affects the bones in the neck, the eyes, and the ears.  It is characterized by Klippel-Feil anomaly (in which the bones of the neck fuse together), Duane syndrome (an eye movement disorder that is present from birth), and hearing loss.   The cause of Wildervanck syndrome is unknown.  In most cases, affected individuals have no family history of the condition.']}"}, "time": 1746283460.995935}
