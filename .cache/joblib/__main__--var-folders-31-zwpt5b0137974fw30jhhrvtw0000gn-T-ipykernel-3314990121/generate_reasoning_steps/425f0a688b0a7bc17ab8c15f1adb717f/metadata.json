The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Cleft hand absent tibia.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Intellectual disability, epileptic seizures, hypogonadism and hypogenitalism, microcephaly, and obesity?

Other mucosal sites that might be affected include the nasopharnyx, larynx, genitalia, rectum, and esophagus. The condition usually begins in late adulthood (e.g. 50's or 60's), affects more women than men, and has a variable prognosis. Scarring of the affected  mucosa of the eye may lead to blindness and tends to be the most feared complication. A combination of environmental and genetic factors appear to play a role in the susceptibility of developing cicatricial pemphigoid. Although the specific causes of this condition have not been identified, it is considered an autoimmune disease that is characterized by the production of autoantibodies against basement membrane zone antigens such as BP180, BP230, and laminin 5.  Treatment is dependent on the person's specific symptoms.\", 'Pseudoachondroplasia is an inherited disorder of bone growth which is characterized by short stature. Other features include short arms and legs, a waddling walk, early-onset joint pain (osteoarthritis), and a limited range of motion at the elbows and hips. Intelligence, facial features and head size are normal. Pseudoachondroplasia is caused by mutations in the COMP gene. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.']}"}, "time": 1746283456.473072}
