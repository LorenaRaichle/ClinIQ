Most food digestion and nutrient absorption take place in the small intestine.

The large intestine then changes waste from liquid to a solid matter called stool.', \"The main cause of short bowel syndrome is surgery to remove a portion of the small intestine. This surgery can treat intestinal diseases, injuries, or birth defects.\\n                \\nSome children are born with an abnormally short small intestine or with part of their bowel missing, which can cause short bowel syndrome. In infants, short bowel syndrome most commonly occurs following surgery to treat necrotizing enterocolitis, a condition in which part of the tissue in the intestines is destroyed.1\\n                \\nShort bowel syndrome may also occur following surgery to treat conditions such as\\n                \\n- cancer and damage to the intestines caused by cancer treatment  - Crohn's disease, a disorder that causes inflammation, or swelling, and irritation of any part of the digestive tract  - gastroschisis, which occurs when the intestines stick out of the body through one side of the umbilical cord  - internal hernia, which occurs when the small intestine is displaced into pockets in the abdominal lining  - intestinal atresia, which occurs when a part of the intestines doesn't form completely  - intestinal injury from loss of blood flow due to a blocked blood vessel  - intestinal injury from trauma  - intussusception, in which one section of either the large or small intestine folds into itself, much like a collapsible telescope  - meconium ileus, which occurs when the meconium, a newborn's first stool, is thicker and stickier than normal and blocks the ileum  - midgut volvulus, which occurs when blood supply to the middle of the small intestine is completely cut off  - omphalocele, which occurs when the intestines, liver, or other organs stick out through the navel, or belly button\\n                \\nEven if a person does not have surgery, disease or injury can damage the small intestine.\", 'Short bowel syndrome is a rare condition.
