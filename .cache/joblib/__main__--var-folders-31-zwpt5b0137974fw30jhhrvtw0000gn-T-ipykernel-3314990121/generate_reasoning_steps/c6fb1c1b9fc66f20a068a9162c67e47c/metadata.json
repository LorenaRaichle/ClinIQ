Most spider bites are harmless. Occasionally, spider bites can cause allergic reactions. And bites by the venomous black widow and brown recluse spiders can be very dangerous to people.      If you are bitten by a spider, you may see a reaction similar to that of a bee sting, including redness, pain and swelling at the site. To treat a spider bite:            - Wash the area well with soap and water    - Apply an ice pack or a wet compress to the area    - Take over-the-counter pain medicine, if needed    - Consider using antihistamines for severe swelling    - Seek medical treatment for small children and adults with severe symptoms', 'Leukemia is cancer of the white blood cells. It is the most common type of childhood cancer. Your blood cells form in your bone marrow. White blood cells help your body fight infection. In leukemia, the bone marrow produces abnormal white blood cells. These cells crowd out the healthy blood cells, making it hard for blood to do its work.    Leukemia can develop quickly or slowly. Acute leukemia is a fast growing type while chronic leukemia grows slowly. Children with leukemia usually have one of the acute types.     Symptoms include       - Infections    - Fever    - Loss of appetite    - Tiredness    - Easy bruising or bleeding    - Swollen lymph nodes    - Night sweats    - Shortness of breath    - Pain in the bones or joints       Risk factors for childhood leukemia include having a brother or sister with leukemia, having certain genetic disorders and having had radiation or chemotherapy. Treatment often cures childhood leukemia. Treatment options include chemotherapy, other drug therapy and radiation. In some cases bone marrow and blood stem cell transplantation might help.     NIH: National Cancer Institute', \"Pigmentation means coloring. Skin pigmentation disorders affect the color of your skin. Your skin gets its color from a pigment called melanin. Special cells in the skin make melanin. When these cells become damaged or unhealthy, it affects melanin production. Some pigmentation disorders affect just patches of skin. Others affect your entire body.     If your body makes too much melanin, your skin gets darker. Pregnancy, Addison's disease, and sun exposure all can make your skin darker. If your body makes too little melanin, your skin gets lighter. Vitiligo is a condition that causes patches of light skin. Albinism is a genetic condition affecting a person's skin. A person with albinism may have no color, lighter than normal skin color, or patchy missing skin color. Infections, blisters and burns can also cause lighter skin.\", \"Summary : Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment. It uses high doses of radiation to kill cancer cells and stop them from spreading. About half of all cancer patients receive it. The radiation may be external, from special machines, or internal, from radioactive substances that a doctor places inside your body. The type of radiation therapy you receive depends on many factors, including       - The type of cancer    - The size of the cancer    - The cancer's location in the body    - How close the cancer is to normal tissues that are sensitive to radiation    - How far into the body the radiation needs to travel    - Your general health and medical history    - Whether you will have other types of cancer treatment    - Other factors, such as your age and other medical conditions       Radiation therapy can damage normal cells as well as cancer cells. Treatment must be carefully planned to minimize side effects. Common side effects include skin changes and fatigue. Other side effects depend on the part of your body being treated.    Sometimes radiation is used with other treatments, like surgery or chemotherapy.     NIH: National Cancer Institute\"]}"}, "time": 1746283466.726919}
