The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal form of the vertebral bodies 90% Abnormality of epiphysis morphology 90% Micromelia 90% Narrow chest 90% Short neck 90% Short stature 90% Short thorax 90% Skeletal dysplasia 90% Broad forehead 50% Cleft palate 50% Hyperlordosis 50% Hypertelorism 50% Malar flattening 50% Osteoarthritis 50% Talipes 50% Cataract 7.5% Glaucoma 7.5% Hearing impairment 7.5% Kyphosis 7.5% Myopia 7.5% Nystagmus 7.5% Retinal detachment 7.5% Scoliosis 7.5% Autosomal dominant inheritance - Barrel-shaped chest - Cervical myelopathy - Coxa vara - Delayed calcaneal ossification - Delayed pubic bone ossification - Flat face - Flattened epiphysis - Hip dislocation - Hypoplasia of the odontoid process - Limitation of knee mobility - Limited elbow movement - Limited hip movement - Lumbar hyperlordosis - Muscular hypotonia - Neonatal short-trunk short stature - Ovoid vertebral bodies - Pectus carinatum - Platyspondyly - Respiratory distress - Restrictive lung disease - Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia - Talipes equinovarus - Vitreoretinal degeneration - Waddling gait - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'How is spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita inherited? Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (SEDC) is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that one altered (mutated) gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases of SEDC do not result from inheriting it from a parent, however; the condition more commonly results from a random, new mutation in the gene occurring for the first time in an affected individual who does not have a history SEDC in the family. In most of these cases, the risk to have another child with the condition is comparable to the risk for an individual in the general population to have a child with the condition. A few cases of autosomal recessive forms of SEDC have been reported. Germline mosaicism has also been reported for this condition. In this case, the parent does not have the mutated gene in all the cells of the body (and is not affected), but only in some of the germ cells (sperm or egg cells). The recurrence risk for a parent with germline mosaicism to have another affected child is difficult to predict. For conditions with autosomal dominant inheritance, studies have demonstrated that the risk to have another affected child may be low (about 1%), moderate (about 6%), or higher (about 30%), depending on the proportion of germ cells with the mutation as well as the disorder itself.', 'Cockayne syndrome is a rare condition which causes short stature, premature aging (progeria), severe photosensitivity, and moderate to severe learning delay. This syndrome also includes failure to thrive in the newborn, microcephaly, and impaired nervous system development. Other symptoms may include hearing loss, tooth decay, and eye and bone abnormalities.  Cockayne syndrome type 1 (type A) is sometimes called classic or \"moderate\" Cockayne syndrome and is diagnosed during early childhood. Cockayne syndrome type 2 (type B) is sometimes referred to as the severe or \"early-onset\" type. This more severe form presents with growth and developmental abnormalities at birth. The third type, Cockayne syndrome type 3 (type C) is a milder form of the disorder. Cockayne syndrome is caused by mutations in either the ERCC8 (CSA) or ERCC6 (CSB) genes and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. The typical lifespan for individuals with Cockayne syndrome type 1 is ten to twenty years. Individuals with type 2 usually do not survive past childhood. Those with type 3 live into middle adulthood.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Cockayne syndrome type III? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Cockayne syndrome type III.
