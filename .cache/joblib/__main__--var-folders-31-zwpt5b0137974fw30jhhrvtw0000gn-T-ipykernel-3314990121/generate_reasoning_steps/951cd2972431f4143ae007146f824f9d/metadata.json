It uses high-frequency sound waves to look at organs and structures inside the body. Health care professionals use it to view the heart, blood vessels, kidneys, liver, and other organs. During pregnancy, doctors use ultrasound to view the fetus. Unlike x-rays, ultrasound does not expose you to radiation.    During an ultrasound test, you lie on a table. A special technician or doctor moves a device called a transducer over part of your body. The transducer sends out sound waves, which bounce off the tissues inside your body. The transducer also captures the waves that bounce back. The ultrasound machine creates images from the sound waves.', 'Summary : A urinalysis is a test of your urine. It is often done to check for a urinary tract infections, kidney problems, or diabetes.

The bacteria usually attack the lungs, but they can also damage other parts of the body.     TB spreads through the air when a person with TB of the lungs or throat coughs, sneezes, or talks. If you have been exposed, you should go to your doctor for tests. You are more likely to get TB if you have a weak immune system.    Symptoms of TB in the lungs may include       -  A bad cough that lasts 3 weeks or longer    -  Weight loss    -  Loss of appetite    -  Coughing up blood or mucus    -  Weakness or fatigue     -  Fever    -  Night sweats       Skin tests, blood tests, x-rays, and other tests can tell if you have TB. If not treated properly, TB can be deadly. You can usually cure active TB by taking several medicines for a long period of time.
