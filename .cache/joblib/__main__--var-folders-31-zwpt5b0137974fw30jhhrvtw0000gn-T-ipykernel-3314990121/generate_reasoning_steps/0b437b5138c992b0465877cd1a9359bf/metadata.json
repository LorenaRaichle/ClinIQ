In people affected by Barrett esophagus, the tissue lining the esophagus (the tube connecting the mouth to the stomach) is replaced by cells that are similar to those found in the lining of the intestines. This change does not cause any specific signs or symptoms. However, Barrett esophagus is typically diagnosed in people who have long-term gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD may be associated with symptoms such as frequent heartburn, difficulty swallowing food, and/or chest pain (less commonly). People with Barrett esophagus do have a greater risk than the general population of developing esophageal cancer. However, the overall risk is still low as less than 0.5 percent of people with Barrett esophagus develop cancer of the esophagus each year. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Barrett esophagus. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the abdominal organs 90% Neoplasm 50% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What causes Barrett esophagus? The exact underlying cause of Barrett esophagus is unknown. However, certain factors are known to increase the risk of developing the condition. These include: Long-standing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) Obesity (specifically high levels of belly fat) Smoking Factors that may decrease the risk include having a Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection; frequent use of aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; and a diet high in fruits, vegetables, and certain vitamins.', 'Is Barrett esophagus inherited? Barrett esophagus usually occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. In rare cases, it can affect more than one family member; however, it is unclear whether these cases are due to common environmental exposures or an inherited predisposition (or a combination of the two). One study found that some people with Barrett esophagus who go on to develop esophageal adenocarcinoma have changes (mutations) in the MSR1, ASCC1, and/or CTHRC1 genes. However, additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.', \"How is Barrett esophagus diagnosed? Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with a biopsy is the procedure of choice for confirming a diagnosis of Barret esophagus. A diagnosis is often made while investigating other conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Based on the biopsy, a doctor will be able to determine the severity of the condition, which can help inform treatment decisions. The sample may be classified as: No dysplasia - a diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus is confirmed, but no precancerous changes are found in the cells Low-grade dysplasia - the cells show small signs of precancerous changes High-grade dysplasia - the cells show many precancerous changes. This is thought to be the final step before cells change into esophageal cancer The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases' (NIDDK) Web site offers more specific information on the diagnosis of Barret esophagus.
