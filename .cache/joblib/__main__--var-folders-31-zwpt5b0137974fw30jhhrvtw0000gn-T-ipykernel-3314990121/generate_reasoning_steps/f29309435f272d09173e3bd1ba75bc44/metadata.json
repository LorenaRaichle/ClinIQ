It is the most common type of skin cancer in the United States, but it spreads slowly and is rarely life-threatening. Basal cell carcinoma occurs most often on parts of the body that have been exposed to the sun, such as the face, ears, neck, hands and legs. However, it can be found on any part of the body.', 'Squamous cell carcinoma develops in the squamous cells of the epidermis, the outer layer of the skin. It is much less common than basal cell carcinoma and is rarely life-threatening. Squamous cell carcinoma occurs most often on parts of the body that have been exposed to the sun, such as the face, ears, neck, hands and legs. However, it can be found on any part of the body.', 'Melanoma is the fastest growing and most invasive type of skin cancer. This cancer arises from overgrowth of melanocytes. Melanocytes are specialized skin cells that produce a pigment called melanin.', 'When the cancer spreads from its original tumor location in the skin to another part of the body such as the brain, it is called metastatic skin cancer. It is not the same as a cancer that started in the brain (brain cancer). Doctors sometimes call this \"distant\" disease.']}"}, "time": 1746283468.224822}
