Management generally focuses on the specific signs and symptoms present in each person. Treatments for the complications of Noonan syndrome (such as cardiovascular abnormalities) are generally standard and do not differ from treatment in the general population. Developmental disabilities are addressed by early intervention programs and individualized education strategies. Treatment for serious bleeding depends upon the specific factor deficiency or platelet abnormality. Growth hormone treatment increases growth velocity. More detailed information about treatment for Noonan syndrome can be viewed on the GeneReviews Web site.', 'Nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia due to hexokinase deficiency (NSHA due to HK1 deficiency) is a very rare condition mainly characterized by severe, chronic hemolysis, beginning in infancy. Approximately 20 cases of this condition have been described to date. Signs and symptoms of hexokinase deficiency are very similar to those of pyruvate kinase deficiency but anemia is generally more severe. Some affected individuals reportedly have had various abnormalities in addition to NSHA including multiple malformations, panmyelopathy, and latent diabetes. It can be caused by mutations in the HK1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment may include red cell transfusions for those with severe anemia.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia due to hexokinase deficiency? Hexokinase deficiency manifests itself primarily as nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (NSHA). The signs and symptoms of hexokinase deficiency are very similar to those of pyruvate kinase deficiency, a more common inherited cause of hemolytic anemia, and may include jaundice, fatigue, lethargy, and pale skin.. However, the anemia associated with hexokinase deficiency is generally more severe. There have been reports of some affected individuals having various other abnormalities including multiple malformations, panmyelopathy, and latent diabetes. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia due to hexokinase deficiency. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal recessive inheritance - Cholecystitis - Cholelithiasis - Congenital onset - Hyperbilirubinemia - Jaundice - Nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia - Normochromic anemia - Normocytic anemia - Reticulocytosis - Splenomegaly - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'What causes nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia due to hexokinase deficiency? Nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia due to hexokinase deficiency has been shown to be caused by mutations in the HK1 gene, which cause at least a partial deficiency of the enzyme hexokinase. This enzyme plays an important role in the chemical processes involved in the breakdown of sugar molecules (glycolysis). Red blood cells depend on this process for energy; if an enzyme is defective in any one of the stages, the red blood cell cannot function properly and hemolysis takes place. When red blood cells cannot be replaced faster than they destroy themselves, anemia results.']}"}, "time": 1746283461.2014809}
