Platelets help wounds heal and prevent bleeding by forming blood clots. Your bone marrow makes platelets. Problems can result from having too few or too many platelets, or from platelets that do not work properly.      If your blood has a low number of platelets, it is called thrombocytopenia. This can put you at risk for mild to serious bleeding. If your blood has too many platelets, you may have a higher risk of blood clots. With other platelet disorders, the platelets do not work as they should. For example, in von Willebrand Disease, the platelets cannot stick together or cannot attach to blood vessel walls. This can cause excessive bleeding.      Treatment of platelet disorders depends on the cause.     NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', \"A poison is any substance that is harmful to your body. You might swallow it, inhale it, inject it, or absorb it through your skin. Any substance can be poisonous if too much is taken. Poisons can include       - Prescription or over-the-counter medicines taken in doses that are too high    - Overdoses of illegal drugs    - Carbon monoxide from gas appliances    - Household products, such as laundry powder or furniture polish     - Pesticides     - Indoor or outdoor plants     - Metals such as lead and mercury        The effects of poisoning range from short-term illness to brain damage, coma, and death. To prevent poisoning it is important to use and store products exactly as their labels say. Keep dangerous products where children can't get to them. Treatment for poisoning depends on the type of poison. If you suspect someone has been poisoned, call your local poison control center right away.\", \"Anthrax is a disease caused by Bacillus anthracis, a germ that lives in soil. Many people know about it from the 2001 bioterror attacks. In the attacks, someone purposely spread anthrax through the U.S. mail. This killed five people and made 22 sick.     Anthrax is rare. It affects animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats more often than people. People can get anthrax from contact with infected animals, wool, meat, or hides. It can cause three forms of disease in people. They are       -  Cutaneous, which affects the skin. People with cuts or open sores can get it if they touch the bacteria.     -  Inhalation, which affects the lungs. You can get this if you breathe in spores of the bacteria.     -  Gastrointestinal, which affects the digestive system. You can get it by eating infected meat.       Antibiotics often cure anthrax if it is diagnosed early. But many people don't know they have anthrax until it is too late to treat. A vaccine to prevent anthrax is available for people in the military and others at high risk.     NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases\", \"If you feel pain and stiffness in your body or have trouble moving around, you might have arthritis. Most kinds of arthritis cause pain and swelling in your joints. Joints are places where two bones meet, such as your elbow or knee. Over time, a swollen joint can become severely damaged. Some kinds of arthritis can also cause problems in your organs, such as your eyes or skin.    Types of arthritis include       - Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis. It's often related to aging or to an injury.    - Autoimmune arthritis happens when your body's immune system attacks healthy cells in your body by mistake. Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common form of this kind of arthritis.    - Juvenile arthritis is a type of arthritis that happens in children.    - Infectious arthritis is an infection that has spread from another part of the body to the joint.    - Psoriatic arthritis affects people with psoriasis.    - Gout is a painful type of arthritis that happens when too much uric acid builds up in the body. It often starts in the big toe.       NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases\"]}"}, "time": 1746283467.189101}
