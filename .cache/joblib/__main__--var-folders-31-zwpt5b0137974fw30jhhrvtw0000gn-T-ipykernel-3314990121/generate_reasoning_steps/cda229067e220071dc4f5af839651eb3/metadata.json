Muscles and tendons help the elbow joint move. When any of these structures is hurt or diseased, you have elbow problems.     Many things can make your elbow hurt. A common cause is tendinitis, an inflammation or injury to the tendons that attach muscle to bone. Tendinitis of the elbow is a sports injury, often from playing tennis or golf. You may also get tendinitis from overuse of the elbow.     Other causes of elbow pain include sprains, strains, fractures, dislocations, bursitis and arthritis. Treatment depends on the cause.', 'Summary : Planning for the end of life can be difficult. But by deciding what end-of-life care best suits your needs when you are healthy, you can help those close to you make the right choices when the time comes.    End-of-life planning usually includes making choices about the following:       - The goals of care (for example, whether to use certain medicines during the last days of life)    - Where you want to spend your final days    - Which treatments for end-of-life care you wish to receive    - What type of palliative care and hospice care you wish to receive       Advance directives can help make your wishes clear to your family and health care providers.', \"In the United States, 1 in 4 women dies from heart disease. The most common cause of heart disease in both men and women is narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries, the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart itself. This is called coronary artery disease, and it happens slowly over time. It's the major reason people have heart attacks.    Heart diseases that affect women more than men include       - Coronary microvascular disease (MVD) - a problem that affects the heart's tiny arteries    - Broken heart syndrome - extreme emotional stress leading to severe but often short-term heart muscle failure       The older a woman gets, the more likely she is to get heart disease. But women of all ages should be concerned about heart disease. All women can take steps to prevent it by practicing healthy lifestyle habits.     NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\", 'A stroke is a medical emergency. There are two types - ischemic and hemorrhagic. Hemorrhagic stroke is the less common type. It happens when a blood vessel breaks and bleeds into the brain. Within minutes, brain cells begin to die. Causes include a bleeding aneurysm, an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), or an artery wall that breaks open.    Symptoms of stroke are       - Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg (especially on one side of the body)    - Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech    - Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes    - Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination    - Sudden severe headache with no known cause       It is important to treat strokes as quickly as possible. With a hemorrhagic stroke, the first steps are to find the cause of bleeding in the brain and then control it. Surgery may be needed. Post-stroke rehabilitation can help people overcome disabilities caused by stroke damage.    National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke']}"}, "time": 1746283467.466471}
