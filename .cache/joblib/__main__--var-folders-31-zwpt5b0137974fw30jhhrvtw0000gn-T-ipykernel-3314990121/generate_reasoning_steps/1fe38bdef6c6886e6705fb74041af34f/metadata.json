People may consider suicide when they are hopeless and can't see any other solution to their problems. Often it's related to serious depression, alcohol or substance abuse, or a major stressful event.    People who have the highest risk of suicide are white men. But women and teens report more suicide attempts. If someone talks about suicide, you should take it seriously. Urge them to get help from their doctor or the emergency room, or call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). It is available 24/7.    Therapy and medicines can help most people who have suicidal thoughts. Treating mental illnesses and substance abuse can reduce the risk of suicide.

It produces juices that help break down food and hormones that help control blood sugar levels. Problems with the pancreas can lead to many health problems. These include       - Pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas: This happens when digestive enzymes start digesting the pancreas itself    -  Pancreatic cancer    -  Cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder in which thick, sticky mucus can also block tubes in your pancreas       The pancreas also plays a role in diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, the beta cells of the pancreas no longer make insulin because the body's immune system has attacked them. In  type 2 diabetes, the pancreas loses the ability to secrete enough insulin in response to meals.\", 'If you\\'re a parent, you get plenty of suggestions on how to raise your child.
