Affected individuals commonly have a partially formed ear (microtia) or totally absent ear (anotia), noncancerous (benign) growths of the eye (ocular dermoid cysts), and spinal abnormalities. Goldenhar disease may also affect the facial structure, heart, lungs, kidneys, and central nervous system. The underlying cause of the condition remains unknown.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Goldenhar disease? The major signs and symptoms of Goldenhar disease are usually only seen on one side of the body. These major features include a partially formed ear (microtia) or totally absent ear (anotia), noncancerous (benign) growths of the eye (ocular dermoid cysts), and spinal abnormalities. Affected individuals may have a variety of other signs and symptoms involving the ears, eyes, and spine as well as the face, heart, lungs, and central nervous system. The severity of these features can vary greatly among individuals with Goldenhar disease. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Goldenhar disease. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.', 'Epithelioid sarcoma is a rare cancer that most often occurs in the soft tissue of the fingers, hands and forearms of young adults.  It may also be found in the legs, trunk, head or neck regions.  It is rare in young children and adults, and it occurs more frequently in men.  Epithelioid sarcoma begins as a painless, firm growth or bump that may be accompanied by an open wound (ulceration) in the skin covering the growth.  It is considered an aggressive cancer because it has a high chance of regrowing after treatment (a recurrence), or spreading to surrounding tissues or more distant parts of the body (a metastasis).  Epithelioid sarcoma is first treated with surgery to remove all the cancer cells (wide local excision).  Amputation of part of the affected limb may be needed in severe cases.  Radiation therapy or chemotherapy may also be used to destroy any cancer cells not removed during surgery.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of Odontomicronychial dysplasia?
