This means that the thigh bone is angled away from the body, the knee is bent, and the foot is turned outward. Anterior hip dislocations occur when the femoral head (the ball-shaped top of the thigh bone) is forced out of the hip socket in a forward direction. This type of injury is often caused by high-energy trauma, such as a car accident or a fall from a significant height. Anterior hip dislocations are considered a medical emergency and require prompt treatment to prevent complications such as nerve damage, blood vessel injury, or avascular necrosis (death of bone tissue due to lack of blood supply).",

        "Amyloidosis refers to a family of diseases in which there is a buildup of clumps of proteins called amyloids in body tissues and organs. These proteins slowly replace normal tissue, leading to failure of the involved organ. There are many forms of amyloidosis that may involve specific organs like the heart (cardiac amlyoidosis), the neurologic system with a peripheral neuropathy or the kidney. Cardiac amyloidosis usually occurs as part of primary amyloidosis (AL type amyloidosis). Primary amyloidosis is often seen in people with multiple myeloma and cancer. Cardiac amyloidosis (\" stiff heart syndrome \") occurs when amyloid deposits take the place of normal heart muscle. It is the most typical form of restrictive cardiomyopathy. Cardiac amyloidosis may affect the way electrical impulses move through the heart (electrical conduction system). This can lead to irregular heart beating also known as arrhythmias and failure of the electrical impulses to conduct through the heart (heart block). Secondary amyloidosis (AA type amyloidosis) rarely affects the heart. However, one form of secondary amyloidosis called senile amyloidosis may involve the heart and blood vessels. Senile amyloidosis is caused by overproduction of a different protein. The condition is becoming more common as the average age of the population increases.\nThere is no difference in the incidence of cardiac amyloidosis between men and women as it affects both genders equally. The disease is rare in people under age 40.",
        "Medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera) or oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) are commonly used to treat anovulatory bleeding. Anovulatory bleeding is a type of abnormal uterine bleeding that occurs when a woman's menstrual cycle is disrupted and ovulation does not occur. This can lead to irregular, heavy, or prolonged bleeding. Medroxyprogesterone acetate is a synthetic form of progesterone that can help regulate the menstrual cycle and reduce bleeding. It is usually taken for 5-10 days each month. OCPs contain a combination of estrogen and progesterone, and work by regulating the menstrual cycle and preventing ovulation. They are taken daily for 21 days, followed by a 7-day break during which bleeding occurs. The choice of medication will depend on the individual's specific circumstances, and should be discussed with a healthcare provider. In addition to medication, lifestyle changes such as regular exercise and a healthy diet can also help manage the symptoms of anovulatory bleeding.",
        "What causes hypophosphatasia? Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a genetic condition caused by mutations in the ALPL gene. This gene gives the body instructions to make an enzyme called alkaline phosphatase, which is needed for mineralization of the bones and teeth. Mutations in this gene lead to an abnormal version of the enzyme, thus affecting the mineralization process. A shortage of the enzyme also causes other substances to build up in the body. These abnormalities lead to the features of HPP. ALPL mutations that almost completely eliminate alkaline phosphatase activity generally cause the more severe forms of HPP, while mutations that reduce activity to a lesser extent often cause the milder forms of HPP.",

        "Hydrocephalus is a medical condition characterized by an increase in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume that causes ventricular dilation and may lead to increased intracranial pressure (ICP). CSF is a clear, colorless fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, providing cushioning and nutrients. In hydrocephalus, the excess CSF puts pressure on the brain, which can lead to a variety of symptoms, including headaches, nausea, vomiting, and vision problems. In infants, hydrocephalus can cause the head to enlarge rapidly, while in adults, it can result in cognitive decline, difficulty walking, and urinary incontinence. Treatment for hydrocephalus typically involves surgical intervention to remove the excess fluid and restore normal CSF flow.",
        "If the amount of enzymes doubles, the Vmax doubles, while Km remains constant. Vmax is the maximum rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, while Km is the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half of Vmax. Enzymes are proteins that accelerate chemical reactions by lowering the activation energy required for the reaction to occur. The rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction depends on the concentration of the enzyme and the substrate, as well as the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate. When the amount of enzyme doubles, the rate of the reaction also doubles, which leads to an increase in Vmax. However, the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate, as indicated by the Km value, remains the same.",
        "The probable diagnosis is roseola, which is a viral infection caused by human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6). Roseola typically affects children between the ages of 6 months and 2 years and is characterized by a sudden onset of high fever, which usually lasts for 3-5 days, followed by the appearance of a pinkish-red, blanching maculopapular rash on the trunk, neck, and limbs. Other symptoms of roseola may include irritability, swollen lymph nodes, and mild respiratory symptoms. Roseola is usually a self-limited illness that resolves on its own within a week or two, and treatment is generally supportive, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever and hydration for fluid loss. It is important to seek medical attention if a child exhibits symptoms of roseola, as some other conditions, such as measles or rubella, can cause similar symptoms and require different treatment.",

        "Prostate cancer is a common disease that affects men, usually in middle age or later. In this disorder, certain cells in the prostate become abnormal and multiply without control or order to form a tumor. The prostate is a gland that surrounds the male urethra and helps produce semen, the fluid that carries sperm.  Early prostate cancer usually does not cause pain, and most affected men exhibit no noticeable symptoms. Men are often diagnosed as the result of health screenings, such as a blood test for a substance called prostate specific antigen (PSA) or a medical procedure called a digital rectal exam. As the tumor grows larger, signs and symptoms can include difficulty starting or stopping the flow of urine, a feeling of not being able to empty the bladder completely, blood in the urine or semen, or pain with ejaculation. However, these changes can also occur with many other genitourinary conditions. Having one or more of these symptoms does not necessarily mean that a man has prostate cancer.  The severity and outcome of prostate cancer varies widely. Early-stage prostate cancer can usually be treated successfully, and some older men have prostate tumors that grow so slowly that they may never cause health problems during their lifetime, even without treatment. In other men, however, the cancer is much more aggressive; in these cases, prostate cancer can be life-threatening.  Some cancerous tumors can invade surrounding tissue and spread to other parts of the body. Tumors that begin at one site and then spread to other areas of the body are called metastatic cancers. The signs and symptoms of metastatic cancer depend on where the disease has spread. If prostate cancer spreads, cancerous cells most often appear in the lymph nodes, bones, lungs, liver, or brain. Bone metastases of prostate cancer most often cause pain in the lower back, pelvis, or hips.  A small percentage of all prostate cancers cluster in families. These hereditary cancers are associated with inherited gene mutations. Hereditary prostate cancers tend to develop earlier in life than non-inherited (sporadic) cases.",
        "What treatment is available for sarcoidosis? The treatment of sarcoidosis depends on :  the symptoms present the severity of the symptoms whether any vital organs (e.g., your lungs, eyes, heart, or brain) are affected how the organ is affected. Some organs must be treated, regardless of your symptoms. Others may not need to be treated. Usually, if a patient doesn't have symptoms, he or she doesn't need treatment, and probably will recover in time. Currently, the drug that is most commonly used to treat sarcoidosis is prednisone.  When a patient's condition gets worse when taking prednisone or when the side effects of prednisone are severe in the patient, a doctor may prescribe other drugs. Most of these other drugs reduce inflammation by suppressing the immune system.

One of the ways in which bacterial meningitis can lead to death is through the development of cerebral edema, or swelling of the brain. This swelling can increase pressure within the skull, which can in turn cause the brain to shift or herniate, leading to compression of vital structures within the brainstem. This can result in a range of neurological symptoms, including loss of consciousness, respiratory failure, and even death. While cerebral edema can arise secondary to a number of different factors, including trauma and stroke, it is a particularly common complication of bacterial meningitis, and is one of the reasons why this infection is considered to be a medical emergency that requires urgent treatment.",
        "Summary : If you have coronary artery disease, the arteries in your heart are narrowed or blocked by a sticky material called plaque. Angioplasty is a procedure to restore blood flow through the artery.    You have angioplasty in a hospital. The doctor threads a thin tube through a blood vessel in the arm or groin up to the involved site in the artery. The tube has a tiny balloon on the end. When the tube is in place, the doctor inflates the balloon to push the plaque outward against the wall of the artery. This widens the artery and restores blood flow.    Doctors may use angioplasty to       - Reduce chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart    - Minimize damage to heart muscle from a heart attack       Many people go home the day after angioplasty, and are able to return to work within a week of coming home.

        "There are four main types of treatment for colorectal cancer: surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapies. The option depends on the stage of your cancer. Sometimes two or more types of treatment may be used at the same time or used one after the other. Before treatment starts, ask your health care team about possible side effects and how treatment may change your normal activities. Because cancer treatments often damage healthy cells and tissues, side effects are common. Side effect may not be the same for each person, and they may change from one treatment session to the next.\nSurgery: Surgery is the main treatment for both colon cancer and rectal cancer. The types of surgery are different for each cancer. For colon cancer, surgery type includes colectomy, segmental resection and laparoscopic-assisted colectomy. As rectal cancer is concerned, there are low anterior resection, proctectomy with colo-anal anastomosis, abdominoperineal (AP) resection and pelvic exenteration.\nRadiation therapy: It includes external-beam radiation therapy and brachytherapy (internal radiation therapy). This is a cancer treatment to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing by using high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation.\nChemotherapy: This treatment is to use drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.\nTargeted therapy: This type of therapy is to use drugs such as monoclonal antibodies to attack parts of cancer cells.",

Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\n                \n                \n                    Five types of standard treatment are used:\n                    Surgery      Surgery may be used if the cancer is found in one lung and in nearby lymph nodes only. Because this type of lung cancer is usually found in both lungs, surgery alone is not often used. During surgery, the doctor will also remove lymph nodes to find out if they have cancer in them. Sometimes, surgery may be used to remove a sample of lung tissue to find out the exact type of lung cancer.     Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the operation, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    See Drugs Approved for Small Cell Lung Cancer for more information.       Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat small cell lung cancer, and may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life. Radiation therapy to the brain to lessen the risk that cancer will spread to the brain may also be given.       Laser therapy     Laser therapy is a cancer treatment that uses a laser beam (a narrow beam of intense light) to kill cancer cells.       Endoscopic stent placement     An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument used to look at tissues inside the body. An endoscope has a light and a lens for viewing and may be used to place a stent in a body structure to keep the structure open. An endoscopic stent can be used to open an airway blocked by abnormal tissue.\n                \n                \n                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\n                    Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.\n                \n                \n                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\n                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\n                \n                \n                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\n                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.\n                \n                \n                    Follow-up tests may be needed.\n                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.\n                \n\t\t        \n\t\t            Treatment Options by Stage\n\t\t            \n\t\t                \n\t\t                    Limited-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer\n\t\t                    Treatment of limited-stage small cell lung cancer may include the following:         -  Combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy to the chest.

In children, this damage can lead to a range of symptoms, including abdominal bloating and discomfort, diarrhea, fatty stools (steatorrhea), and poor growth and development (failure to thrive). Other symptoms may include fatigue, irritability, and delayed puberty.

        "The normal physiology of atopic dermatitis can be understood as follows:\nEpidermal barrier function:\nEpidermis: It directly interfaces with the environment and acts as the 1st line of defense. It is primarily dependent on the structure and composition of the most outermost layer of the skin, i.e. stratum corneum. It protects the body from irritants, allergens, microbes, and pathogens from invading the skin as well as preventing the excess water loss. The epidermis consists of:  Tightly packed corneocytes layers in the stratum corneum Intercellular lipid bilayers Corneocytes layers embedded in the extracellular matrix derived from lipid lamellae Natural moisturizing factors (NMF), maintaining the water retention in the stratum corneum Antimicrobial peptides Filaggrin proteins: It is encoded by filaggrin gene FLG on chromosome 1q21 (contains the genes of the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC)) and is the main component required to form corneocytes in the stratum corneum.   Pro- filaggrin is required for the formation of dense cytoplasmic granules, which along with other proteins, forms the corneocytes that acts as a primary unit for the barrier function of the skin. Pro- filaggrin undergoes extensive phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, to produce filaggrin monomers to interact and aggregate with the keratin filaments and permits extensive crosslinking, to form a highly insoluble keratin matrix.  The degraded products of filaggrin protein are one of the major components of natural moisturizing factors (NMF), which prevents excess water loss from the stratum corneum. The degraded products of filaggrin protein also maintain the acidic pH of the stratum corneum, required to regulate the activity of enzymes. Proteins related to tight junctions: These transmembrane proteins are present in the stratum granulosum of the epidermis and come together to form tight junctions which includes the claudin-1, occludin, junctional adhesion molecule.  Other proteins: Filaggrin -2, corneodesmosin, desmoglein-1, desmocollin-1, transglutaminase-3 are also part of skin barrier related proteins. \nImmune response:\nCutaneous immune response: Acts as the first-line barrier and constitutes the rapid response mechanism to the invading allergen or pathogen.  It recognizes the microbes through receptors known as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). The cutaneous immune response includes the following 4 elements:  Physical: Stratum corneum and the tight junctions in stratum granulosum forms the physical barrier. The maintenance and repair of epithelial barriers are mediated through the activation of PRR s by the innate immune system.  Chemical: Chemical constitutes antimicrobial proteins including antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), S100 proteins, cytokines as well as chemokines, innate lymphoid cells group 2 (ILC-2), toll-like receptors (TLRs), keratinocytes, filaggrin degraded products, and neutrophils.   Microbiome: The microbiome consists of skin-resident normal microbial flora including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. It provides protection against invading microbes and pathogens, and modulates the balance between inflammation and immune responses.  Immunological: Immune response includes both non-specific and immediate response (innate immunity) and highly specific and late response (adaptive immunity). Adaptive Immune response:  The character and magnitude of the adaptive immune system is determined by the innate immune response by interactions with the epidermal elements and activation of TLRs.  Thymic stromal lymphopoietin: Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is considered as a master switch for allergic inflammation, and is highly expressed by epithelial cells and epidermal keratinocytes.   It is an IL-7 -like cytokine, which stimulates the differentiation of na\u00efve T helper cells into inflammatory Th2 cells. \nIt is understood that atopic dermatitis is the result of either skin barrier dysfunction or immune dysregulation. \nEpidermal barrier dysfunction (outside-in hypothesis): \nThe major factors causing abnormal skin barrier include loss-of-function mutations in the filaggrin gene (FLG) resulting in:    Filaggrin protein deficiency  Tight junction abnormalities  More alkaline surface pH  Microbial colonization Altered protease activity in the stratum corneum \nSkin barrier abnormalities lead to the increased permeability of the epidermis. This leads to entry of antigens or pathogens resulting in microbial colonization, most notably by staphylococcus aureus and herpes simplex virus (HSV). This sequence of events results in the production of inflammatory cytokines and impaired production of antimicrobial peptides. \nSkin barrier abnormalities also lead to increased trans-epidermal water loss, and decreased levels of ceramides and water binding.  \nSevere atopic dermatitis has been associated with higher levels of trans-epidermal water loss. \nImmune dysregulation (inside-out\u2019 hypothesis): \nInnate immune response: Pathogens or tissue damage activate pattern recognition receptors including toll-like receptors (TLRs), which further induces a release of inflammatory mediators, including AMP s, cytokines, and chemokines.  Defective cutaneous innate immune -mediated epidermal barrier repair and maintenance may alter skin-resident normal microbial flora and lead to severe inflammation as demonstrated with atopic dermatitis patients colonized with s taphylococcus aureus.  In intact skin barrier, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are regulated by cytokines, IL-17, and IL- 22, which are secreted by Th17 and Th22 cells. This effect is suppressed in patients with atopic dermatitis.  Adaptive immune response: Increased allergen penetration through the damaged epidermis leading to a Th2 -type milieu is thought to explain the critical link between the barrier defect of atopic dermatitis patients with FLG mutations and Th2 polarization.  Enhanced expression of Th2, Th17, and Th22 cytokines, characterize the acute initiation of atopic dermatitis lesions.   Epidermal barrier function is regulated through Th2 and Th22 cytokines (IL-4, IL-13, IL-31, and IL-22) by:   Stimulating epidermal hyperplasia Inhibiting the expression of terminal keratinocyte differentiation genes (eg, FLG, loricrin, involucrin) Suppressing the production of AMPs Thymic stromal lymphopoietin: Defective skin barrier and enhanced epidermal protease activity, which is reported in atopic dermatitis, promote TSLP production and Th2 response, leading to atopic dermatitis-like inflammation.  TSLP polymorphisms have been linked to the severity of atopic dermatitis. TSLP genetic variants are associated with atopic dermatitis and eczema herpeticum.  In patients with defective skin barrier due to FLG mutations, TSLP genetic variants are associated with reduced probability of having persistent atopic dermatitis.",

        "Trichomoniasis is a common sexually transmitted disease that affects 7.4 million previously unaffected Americans each year. Trichomonas vaginalis, the causative agent of trichomoniasis, is an anaerobic, flagellated protozoan parasite.  Trichomonas vaginalis was first discovered by Dr. Alfred Fran\u00e7ois Donn\u00e9, a French physician, in 1836.  The parasite is sexually transmitted through contact with an infected partner. Women can acquire the disease from infected men or women, but men usually contract it only from infected women.   Trichomoniasis is primarily an infection of the genitourinary tract. The urethra is the most common site of infection in men, and the vagina is the most common site of infection in women. Trichomoniasis must be differentiated from other causes of vaginitis such as bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and atrophic vaginitis.  In 2008, the incidence of trichomoniasis was estimated to be 358 cases per 100,000 individuals in the United States.  Females are more commonly affected with trichomoniasis than males.  Common risk factors in the development of trichomoniasis include multiple sexual partners, unprotected sexual activity, intravenous drug use, and coexisting veneral disease.   If left untreated, women with trichomoniasis may progress to develop infection of the adnexa, endometrium, and Skene and Bartholin glands. In men, untreated trichomoniasis can cause epididymitis, prostatitis, and decreased sperm cell motility.  Complications of trichomoniasis include pelvic inflammatory disease, increased risk of HIV, increased risk of cervical cancer, increased risk of prostate cancer, and pregnancy-related complications such as low birth weight, preterm delivery, and premature rupture of membranes. The prognosis of trichomoniasis is generally excellent with treatment.  The majority of women (85%) and men (77%) with trichomoniasis are asymptomatic. One-third of asymptomatic women become symptomatic within 6 months. Common symptoms of trichomoniasis in women include vaginal discharge (which is often diffuse, malodorous, and yellow-green or gray in color), painful urination (dysuria), vulvar irritation and itching, abdominal pain, and discomfort during sexual intercourse.  Symptoms of trichomoniasis in men include clear or mucopurulent urethral discharge, painful urination, and pruritus or a burning sensation following sexual intercourse.  Common physical examination findings of trichomoniasis include strawberry cervix and a foul-smelling, frothy, and mucopurulent green or gray vaginal discharge.   In males, there may be scanty, mucopurulent urethral discharge.  Laboratory tests used in the diagnosis of trichomoniasis include saline microscopy, culture, and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs).  Antimicrobial therapy is the mainstay of treatment for trichomoniasis.",
        "How is multiple epiphyseal dysplasia inherited? Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) may be inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner depending on the genetic cause. Most cases are autosomal dominant. In autosomal dominant inheritance, having a mutation in only one of the 2 copies of the responsible gene is enough to cause the condition. The mutation may be inherited from a parent or can occur for the first time in the affected person. Each child of a person with an autosomal dominant condition has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit the mutation. More rarely, MED is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. In autosomal recessive inheritance, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene to be affected. The parents of a person with an autosomal recessive condition usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not have signs or symptoms and are unaffected. When two carriers for the same condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected, a 50% (1 in 2) chance to be a carrier like each parent, and a 25% to be both unaffected and not a carrier.",
        "Annular pancreas is a congenital malformation in which the ventral pancreatic bud forms a ring around the 2nd part of the duodenum. During fetal development, the pancreas forms from two buds: the dorsal and the ventral buds. In normal development, the two buds fuse and form the pancreas. However, in cases of annular pancreas, the ventral bud does not fully fuse and instead forms a ring around the duodenum, which is the first part of the small intestine. This can cause a partial or complete blockage of the duodenum, leading to symptoms such as abdominal pain, vomiting, and failure to thrive in infants. Annular pancreas is a rare condition that is usually diagnosed in infancy or early childhood. Treatment may involve surgery to remove the obstructing tissue and relieve the blockage.",

        "Too much sodium in a person's diet can be harmful because it causes blood to hold fluid. People with CKD need to be careful not to let too much fluid build up in their bodies. The extra fluid raises blood pressure and puts a strain on the heart and kidneys. A dietitian can help people find ways to reduce the amount of sodium in their diet. Nutrition labels provide information about the sodium content in food. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration advises that healthy people should limit their daily sodium intake to no more than 2,300 milligrams (mg), the amount found in 1 teaspoon of table salt. People who are at risk for a heart attack or stroke because of a condition such as high blood pressure or kidney disease should limit their daily sodium intake to no more than 1,500 mg. Choosing sodium-free or low-sodium food products will help them reach that goal.\n                \nSodium is found in ordinary table salt and many salty seasonings such as soy sauce and teriyaki sauce. Canned foods, some frozen foods, and most processed meats have large amounts of salt. Snack foods such as chips and crackers are also high in salt.\n                \nAlternative seasonings such as lemon juice, salt-free seasoning mixes, and hot pepper sauce can help people reduce their salt intake. People with advanced CKD should avoid salt substitutes that use potassium, such as AlsoSalt or Nu-Salt, because CKD limits the body's ability to eliminate potassium from the blood.

        "Many Areas of Research Scientists are constantly searching for new ways to detect skin cancer, assess risk, and predict patient outcomes. They are interested in finding new treatments and new ways to deliver drugs and radiation. As scientists get a better understanding of what causes skin cancer and what genetic and environmental factors play a role, they should be able to design new drugs to hinder the development of cancer. Clinical trials are designed to answer important questions and to find out whether new approaches are safe and effective. Research has already led to advances, such as photodynamic therapy, and researchers continue to search for better ways to prevent and treat skin cancer. Researching Techniques to Deliver Drugs One area that scientists are working on is development of techniques for delivering chemotherapy drugs directly to the area around the tumor, rather than sending the chemotherapy through the entire body. One of these techniques is called hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion. Hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion sends a warm solution containing anti-cancer drugs directly to the arm or leg in which the cancer is located. A tourniquet is used to temporarily cut off the blood flow while the chemotherapy drugs are injected directly into the limb. This allows the patient to receive a high dose of drugs only in the area where the cancer occurred. Genetic Research For basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, researchers are studying gene changes that may be risk factors for the disease. They also are comparing combinations of biological therapy and surgery to treat basal cell cancer. Discovering links between inherited genes, environmental factors, and skin cancer is another area of research that might provide scientists with insight they can use to screen people to determine their risk for the disease. Recently, scientists at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) found one genetic link that dramatically increases the chance of developing melanoma. Research on Melanoma Treatments Other studies are currently exploring new treatment options for melanoma. One recent study discovered a protein that may help block the development and spread of melanoma. This discovery could lead to a new treatment for melanoma patients in the future. Several other studies are examining the potential for using vaccines to treat melanoma. An Advance in Treating Melanoma In June of 2011, an important advance in treating melanoma was announced at an annual cancer meeting. A drug called ipilimumab was approved for treating the disease, and it works differently than traditional chemotherapy. It uses immunotherapy to help the immune system recognize and reject cancer cells. When its successful, immunotherapy can lead to complete reversal of even advanced disease. Some patients with stage IV metastatic disease who were treated in early immunotherapy trials after other therapies were unsuccessful are still in complete remission more than 20 years later. Vaccine Research Traditional vaccines are designed to prevent diseases in healthy people by teaching the body to recognize and attack a virus or bacteria it may encounter in the future. Cancer vaccines, however, are given to people who already have cancer. These vaccines stimulate the immune system to fight against cancer by stopping its growth, shrinking a tumor, or killing the cancer cells that were not killed by other forms of treatment. Developing a vaccine against a tumor such as melanoma is more complicated than developing a vaccine to fight a virus. Clinical trials are in progress at the National Cancer Institute and other institutions to test the effectiveness of treating stage III or stage IV melanoma patients with vaccines.",

        "Autosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia is caused by mutations in the CYB5R3 gene. This gene provides instruction for making an enzyme called cytochrome b5 reductase 3. This enzyme is involved in transferring negatively charged particles called electrons from one molecule to another. Two versions (isoforms) of this enzyme are produced from the CYB5R3 gene. The soluble isoform is present only in red blood cells, and the membrane-bound isoform is found in all other cell types.  Each hemoglobin molecule contains four iron atoms, which are needed to carry oxygen. In normal red blood cells, the iron in hemoglobin is ferrous (Fe2+), but it can spontaneously become ferric (Fe3+). When hemoglobin contains ferric iron, it is methemoglobin. The soluble isoform of cytochrome b5 reductase 3 changes ferric iron back to ferrous iron so hemoglobin can deliver oxygen to tissues. Normally, red blood cells contain less than 2 percent methemoglobin.  The membrane-bound isoform is widely used in the body. This isoform is necessary for many chemical reactions, including the breakdown and formation of fatty acids, the formation of cholesterol, and the breakdown of various molecules and drugs.  CYB5R3 gene mutations that cause autosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia type I typically reduce enzyme activity or stability. As a result, the enzyme cannot efficiently change ferric iron to ferrous iron, leading to a 10 to 50 percent increase in methemoglobin within red blood cells. This increase in methemoglobin and the corresponding decrease in normal hemoglobin reduces the amount of oxygen delivered to tissues. The altered enzyme activity affects only red blood cells because other cells can compensate for a decrease in enzyme activity, but red blood cells cannot.  Mutations that cause autosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia type II usually result in a complete loss of enzyme activity. Cells cannot compensate for a complete loss of this enzyme, which results in a 10 to 70 percent increase in methemoglobin within red blood cells. This increase in methemoglobin and the corresponding decrease in normal hemoglobin leads to cyanosis. The lack of enzyme activity in other cells leads to the neurological features associated with type II. Researchers suspect that the neurological problems are caused by impaired fatty acid and cholesterol formation, which reduces the production of a fatty substance called myelin. Myelin insulates nerve cells and promotes the rapid transmission of nerve impulses. This reduced ability to form myelin (hypomyelination) leads to a loss of nerve cells, particularly in the brain. The loss of these cells likely contributes to the encephalopathy and movement disorders characteristic of autosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia type II.",

        "When a healthy liver allograft is used in place of damaged liver tissue, it is termed as liver transplantation. Thomas Starzl used dogs as the first animals for research on liver transplantation in the 1960s. In 1963, the first liver transplant in humans was attempted by Dr. Thomas Starzl of Colorado, United States. The most common indications for liver transplantation in the United States are hepatitis C virus, alcoholic liver disease, autoimmune liver disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, hepatitis B virus, liver disease due to inborn errors of metabolism, cancer, biliary atresia and acute liver failure. On the other hand, absolute contraindications to liver transplantation include hepatocellular carcinoma with metastasis, acute liver failure with persistently elevated intracranial pressure ICP >50mmHg, hemangiosarcoma, hilar cholangiocarcinoma, sepsis, and active alcohol or drug abuse. Pretransplant measures such as cardiopulmonary evaluation, screening for occult cancer, infection, and psychosocial evaluation must be performed prior to surgery. The most commonly used technique employed in patients is orthotopic transplantation. This involves removal of the native liver and placement of the donor organ in the same anatomic location as the original liver. Immunosuppressive agents used after transplantation include cyclosporine, everolimus, mycophenolate, corticosteroids, azathioprine, and tacrolimus in different combinations. The most common causes of death in liver transplant patients are infection, malignancy, and rejection. It is necessary to monitor patients for signs of complications and treat them effectively.",

If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal recessive inheritance - Bronchiectasis - Fever - Pneumonia - Sinusitis - Splenomegaly - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.",

The catarrhal phase is the early phase of the disease, characterized by symptoms such as runny nose, sneezing, and low-grade fever. During this phase, the bacteria are still replicating in the respiratory tract, and treatment with macrolides can help to reduce the severity and duration of symptoms, as well as prevent the spread of the disease to others.

        "Although everyone has some risk, some people are more prone to getting UTIs than others. People with spinal cord injuries or other nerve damage around the bladder have difficulty emptying their bladder completely, allowing bacteria to grow in the urine that stays in the bladder. Anyone with an abnormality of the urinary tract that obstructs the flow of urinea kidney stone or enlarged prostate, for exampleis at risk for a UTI. People with diabetes or problems with the bodys natural defense system are more likely to get UTIs.\n                \nSexual activity can move microbes from the bowel or vaginal cavity to the urethral opening. If these microbes have special characteristics that allow them to live in the urinary tract, it is harder for the body to remove them quickly enough to prevent infection. Following sexual intercourse, most women have a significant number of bacteria in their urine, but the body normally clears them within 24 hours. However, some forms of birth control increase the risk of UTI. In some women, certain spermicides may irritate the skin, increasing the risk of bacteria invading surrounding tissues. Using a diaphragm may slow urinary flow and allow bacteria to multiply. Condom use is also associated with increased risk of UTIs, possibly because of the increased trauma that occurs to the vagina during sexual activity. Using spermicides with diaphragms and condoms can increase risk even further.\n                \nAnother common source of infection is catheters, or tubes, placed in the urethra and bladder. Catheters interfere with the bodys ability to clear microbes from the urinary tract. Bacteria travel through or around the catheter and establish a place where they can thrive within the bladder. A person who cannot urinate in the normal way or who is unconscious or critically ill often needs a catheter for more than a few days. The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends using catheters for the shortest time possible to reduce the risk of a UTI.3\n                \nRecurrent Infections\n                \nMany women suffer from frequent UTIs. About 20 percent of young women with a first UTI will have a recurrent infection.4 With each UTI, the risk that a woman will continue having recurrent UTIs increases.5 Some women have three or more UTIs a year. However, very few women will have frequent infections throughout their lives. More typically, a woman will have a period of 1 or 2 years with frequent infections, after which recurring infections cease.\n                \nMen are less likely than women to have a first UTI. But once a man has a UTI, he is likely to have another because bacteria can hide deep inside prostate tissue. Anyone who has diabetes or a problem that makes it hard to urinate may have repeat infections.\n                \nResearch funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) suggests that one factor behind recurrent UTIs may be the ability of bacteria to attach to cells lining the urinary tract. One NIH-funded study found that bacteria formed a protective film on the inner lining of the bladder in mice.6 If a similar process can be demonstrated in humans, the discovery may lead to new treatments to prevent recurrent UTIs. Another line of research has indicated that women who are nonsecretors of certain blood group antigens may be more prone to recurrent UTIs because the cells lining the vagina and urethra may allow bacteria to attach more easily. A nonsecretor is a person with an A, B, or AB blood type who does not secrete the normal antigens for that blood type in bodily fluids, such as fluids that line the bladder wall.7\n                \nInfections during Pregnancy\n                \nPregnant women seem no more prone to UTIs than other women. However, when a UTI does occur in a pregnant woman, it is more likely to travel to the kidneys. According to some reports, about 4 to 5 percent of pregnant women develop a UTI.8 Scientists think that hormonal changes and shifts in the position of the urinary tract during pregnancy make it easier for bacteria to travel up the ureters to the kidneys and cause infection. For this reason, health care providers routinely screen pregnant women for bacteria in the urine during the first 3 months of pregnancy.",
        "Rabies is a disease that has been classically associated with infected animals, mainly dogs.The first written record of rabies is in the Codex of Eshnunna (ca. 1930 BC - written prior to the Code of Hammurabi), which demonstrates that the owner of a dog showing symptoms of rabies should take preventive measure against bites. Although dogs are viewed as the main culprit of rabies, rabies is also associated with animals such as possums, skunks, and more importantly, bats. In 1885, 9-year-old boy named Joseph Meister was the first person to have received an effective shot for rabies after being bitten by a rabid dog. Louis Pasteur treated the first case of rabies by a weak form of virus (which later became the basis of active immunization for rabies). In the 1950s, people who had been bitten by a rabid animal got 23 shots along the abdomen. Today, the shots are more effective and less painful. They consist of a series of 6 shots given in the arm over a 1 month period. One shot is given around the bite and the rest are given in the arm.",

As well as Shelter Island.\nMassachusetts- Cape Cod, as well as Islands off the Massachusetts coast such as Nantucket Island and Martha's Vineyard.\nRhode Island- Block Island.\nOther United States regions to have reported at least a single instance of infection include the Western states of California and Washington; Central states of Wisconsin, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Indiana, Michigan, and Missouri; Northeastern states of Connecticut, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Delaware, Maine, Vermont and Maryland; and in the Southern states of Virginia, South Carolina, Louisiana, Texas, and Georgia. However reported cases of Babesiosis are less prevalent in these aforementioned states than those referred to previously on the Northeastern coast. \nGeographically, increased populations of deer, either by means of restocking or states environmental and hunting sanctions, has seemingly contributed to the heightened prevalence of Babesiosis in the United States. Analysis of patient blood smears for an antibody specific to B microti on the United State's Northeastern coast suggests that rates of infection fluctuate seasonally and geographically.  Other contributing factors to the heightened infection rate within these areas may be attributed to an increasing trend in outdoor recreational activity within the aforementioned endemic areas.\nIn 2013, 27 states (all of which are previously listed excluding: Alabama, Oregon, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Wyoming where screening results reported zero occurrences of the disease) conducted a patient population survey for reported Babesiosis. The findings resulted in a total 1,762 reported cases. Comparison of Babesiosis infection rates over the years presents difficulty as it was only declared a nationally notifiable condition by the CDC in January 2011. Yet an analysis of the data collected by the CDC between the years of 2011 and 2013 reveals a heightened increase of nearly 500 more reported cases in 2013. *Furthermore the total prevalence of the disease is practically unattainable as many of the North American cases are non-reported and asymptomatic. \nIn Europe, babesia transmission is primarily the fault of Ixodes ricinus (a European species of ticks). Due to the wide distribution of the species through the European continent, reported cases are not isolated to specific regions. Unlike more common cases of the disease in the United States, babesiosis is a rather rare occurrence in Europe. The disease has also proven a higher morbidity rate. Of the 39 European cases published, all were reported as clinically severe and required immediate action. However, of the reported babesiosis cases reported thus far, the majority have been identified as previously immunocompromised or had undergone a splenectomy.  \nInfected populations have also been recorded in regards to sex and age. Of the total, 1,762 cases reported to the CDC in 2013, findings indicate a median age of 62 years, as well as a distribution of infection between males and females at 65% and 32% respectively. \nSeverity of Babesiosis varies as infection with Babesia parasites can be asymptomatic or cause a mild non-specific illness, although it may also result in severe disease.

The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.",
        "Maternal diabetes during the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of fetal cardiac, limb, and neural tube defects. This is because high blood sugar levels in the mother can interfere with the normal development of the fetus during this critical period. It is important for women with diabetes to closely monitor their blood sugar levels and receive appropriate medical care before and during pregnancy to reduce the risk of complications for themselves and their babies. Additionally, women who are planning to become pregnant should discuss their diabetes management plan with their healthcare provider to ensure that their blood sugar levels are well-controlled before conception.",

The condition is characterized by the development of painful, necrotic lesions on the skin, which can progress rapidly and lead to tissue destruction. In individuals with diabetes mellitus, Ecthyma gangrenosum typically progresses over the course of 12-18 hours, with the development of new lesions and worsening of existing ones. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential for managing the condition and preventing complications.",
        "What are the symptoms of pityriasis lichenoides chronica? Pityriasis lichenoides chronica usually starts out as a small pink papule that turns a reddish-brown color. There is usually a fine, mica-like adherent scale attached to the center which can be peeled off to reveal a shiny, pinkish brown surface. Over several weeks, the spot flattens out spontaneously and leaves behind a brown mark, which fades over several months. Pityriasis lichenoides chronica most commonly occurs over the trunk, buttocks, arms and legs, but may also occur on the hands, feet, face and scalp. Unlike the acute type of pityriasis lichenoides, lesions associated with pityriasis lichenoides chronica are not painful, itchy or irritating. What symptoms are associated with pityriasis lichenoides chronica (PLC)? PLC is the milder form of pityriasis lichenoides, and the lesions associated with this form consist of small, firm, red-brown spots. Unlike PLEVA, the lesions are not irritating and have mica-like adherent scale, which can be scraped off to reveal a shiny brown surface. The spot flattens out over several weeks to leave a brown mark which fades over several months. PLC can look like psoriasis, lichen planus, or insect bites.",
        "The standard treatments for lice or scabies are topical permethrin and oral ivermectin.\n\nLice and scabies are both parasitic infections that affect the skin. The primary treatment for both of these conditions is the use of topical permethrin, which is applied directly to the skin to kill the parasites. In some cases, oral ivermectin may also be prescribed to help eliminate the parasites. Ivermectin is an antiparasitic medication that is taken orally and can be effective against both lice and scabies. It is important to seek medical advice if you suspect you may have lice or scabies, as prompt treatment can help prevent the infection from spreading and reduce the risk of complications. Additionally, it is important to follow the instructions for use of these medications carefully, as misuse or overuse can lead to resistance and treatment failure.",

        "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is a primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells, mostly presents in renal tubular epithelial cells as well as lungs and heart.  Kidney injury following COVID-19 infection is less frequent than severe lung injury, however ACE2: ACE ratio is higher in the kidneys compared to the respiratory system. (1:1 in the kidneys VS 1:20 in the respiratory system)  After SARS-CoV-2 enters through the nasal cavity, it may travel to the kidneys and enter the bloodstream leading to severe inflammatory response activation and cytokine storm. Cytokine induced AKI may occur due to intrarenal inflammation, hyperpermeability of vessels, hypovolemia and cardiomyopathy, leading to cardiorenal syndrome type 1 that is characterized by third space volume overload such as pleural effusion, edema and intravascular volume loss (hypovolemia) and hypotension.  cardiomyopathy and COVID-19-associated myocarditis can lead to hypotension and reduction in renal perfusion. The major cytokine is IL-6, which induces inflammation and lung endothelial cell injury, leading to ARDS and hypoxia that subsequently cause renal tubular cell injury and AKI.  \nOther Cytokine releasing factors in critically ill patients with COVID-19 include:  Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) Mechanical ventilation Continuous renal replacement therapy\nTo conclude, COVID-19 -associated AKI can occur as a result of:  Sepsis and cytokine storm Hypovolemia and Hypotension Hypoxemia Blood clots formation due to hypercoagulable state, leading to impaired blood flow in the renal arterioles.",

        "Heart-type Fatty Acid-Binding Protein (H-FABP) is a small cytoplasmic protein (15 kDa) released from cardiac myocytes following an ischemic episode.  Like the nine other distinct FABPs that have been identified, H-FABP is involved in active fatty acid metabolism where it transports fatty acids from the cell membrane to mitochondria for oxidation.  See FABP3 for biochemical details.\nThe intracellular fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) belongs to a multigene family. FABPs are divided into at least three distinct types, namely the hepatic-, intestinal- and cardiac-type. They form 14-15 kDa proteins and are thought to participate in the uptake, intracellular metabolism and/or transport of long-chain fatty acids. They may also be responsible in the modulation of cell growth and proliferation. Fatty acid-binding protein 3 gene contains four exons and its function is to arrest growth of mammary epithelial cells. This gene is also a candidate tumor suppressor gene for human breast cancer.",
        "Genitopatellar syndrome is a rare condition characterized by genital abnormalities, missing or underdeveloped kneecaps (patellae), intellectual disability, and abnormalities affecting other parts of the body.  The genital abnormalities in affected males typically include undescended testes (cryptorchidism) and underdevelopment of the scrotum. Affected females can have an enlarged clitoris (clitoromegaly) and small labia.  Missing or underdeveloped patellae is the most common skeletal abnormality associated with genitopatellar syndrome. Affected individuals may have additional skeletal problems, including joint deformities (contractures) involving the hips and knees or an inward- and upward-turning foot called a clubfoot. Bone abnormalities of the spine, ribs, collarbone (clavicle), and pelvis have also been reported.  Genitopatellar syndrome is also associated with delayed development and intellectual disability, which are often severe. Affected individuals may have an usually small head (microcephaly) and structural brain abnormalities, including underdeveloped or absent tissue connecting the left and right halves of the brain (agenesis of the corpus callosum).  People with genitopatellar syndrome may have distinctive facial features such as prominent cheeks and eyes, a nose with a rounded tip or a broad bridge, an unusually small chin (micrognathia) or a chin that protrudes (prognathism), and a narrowing of the head at the temples. Many affected infants have weak muscle tone (hypotonia) that leads to breathing and feeding difficulties. The condition can also be associated with abnormalities of the heart, kidneys, and teeth.",
        "The serotonin released from carcinoid tumors in the small bowel is metabolized in the liver by the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO), which converts it into 5-HIAA (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid). Carcinoid tumors are a type of neuroendocrine tumor that can produce and release serotonin into the bloodstream, leading to a condition known as carcinoid syndrome. The liver plays a crucial role in the metabolism of serotonin, as it is the primary site of MAO activity in the body. The measurement of 5-HIAA levels in urine or blood can be used as a diagnostic test for carcinoid syndrome, as elevated levels of 5-HIAA indicate increased production and release of serotonin from carcinoid tumors.",

        "Mutations in the JUP, DSP, DSC2, and KANK2 genes cause keratoderma with woolly hair types I through IV, respectively. The JUP, DSP, and DSC2 genes provide instructions for making components of specialized cell structures called desmosomes. Desmosomes are located in the membrane surrounding certain cells, including skin and heart muscle cells. Desmosomes help attach cells to one another, which provides strength and stability to tissues. They also play a role in signaling between cells.  Mutations in the JUP, DSP, or DSC2 gene alter the structure and impair the function of desmosomes. Abnormal or missing desmosomes prevent cells from sticking to one another effectively, which likely makes the hair, skin, and heart muscle more fragile. Over time, as these tissues are exposed to mechanical stress (for example, friction on the surface of the skin or the constant contraction and relaxation of the heart muscle), they become damaged and can no longer function normally. This mechanism probably underlies the skin, hair, and heart problems that occur in keratoderma with woolly hair. Some studies suggest that abnormal cell signaling may also contribute to cardiomyopathy in people with this group of conditions.  Unlike the other genes associated with keratoderma with woolly hair, the KANK2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is not part of desmosomes. Instead, it regulates other proteins called steroid receptor coactivators (SRCs), whose function is to help turn on (activate) certain genes. SRCs play important roles in tissues throughout the body, including the skin. Studies suggest that mutations in the KANK2 gene disrupt the regulation of SRCs, which leads to abnormal gene activity. However, it is unclear how these changes underlie the skin and hair abnormalities in keratoderma with woolly hair type IV.",
        "The recommended approach for managing moderate lead poisoning in children is to use DMSA (succimer).\n\nLead poisoning is a serious condition that can cause a range of health problems, particularly in children. In cases of moderate lead poisoning, with blood lead levels between 45-69 mcg/dL on venous blood testing, treatment is necessary to prevent long-term complications. The recommended approach for managing moderate lead poisoning in children is to use DMSA (succimer). DMSA is a chelating agent that helps to remove lead from the body. It is taken orally and is generally well-tolerated by children. DMSA has been shown to be effective at reducing blood lead levels and preventing further damage to the body. However, it is important to note that treatment for lead poisoning should be tailored to the individual patient and may involve other interventions, such as nutritional support, monitoring for complications, and follow-up testing. In general, the key to managing moderate lead poisoning in children is early detection and prompt treatment with appropriate medications and interventions.",

        "What causes Williams syndrome? Williams syndrome is caused by the deletion of genetic material from a specific region of chromosome 7. The deleted region includes more than 25 genes, and researchers believe that a loss of several of these genes probably contributes to the characteristic features of this disorder. CLIP2, ELN, GTF2I, GTF2IRD1, and LIMK1 are among the genes that are typically deleted in people with Williams syndrome. Researchers have found that the loss of the ELN gene is associated with the connective tissue abnormalities and cardiovascular disease (specifically supravalvular aortic stenosis) found in many people with this condition. Studies suggest that deletions of CLIP2, GTF2I, GTF2IRD1, LIMK1, and perhaps other genes may help explain the characteristic difficulties with visual-spatial tasks, unique behavioral characteristics, and other cognitive difficulties seen in people with Williams syndrome. Loss of the GTF2IRD1 gene may also contribute to the distinctive facial features often associated with this condition. Researchers believe that the presence or absence of the NCF1 gene on chromosome 7 is related to the risk of developing hypertension in people with Williams syndrome. When the NCF1 gene is included in the part of the chromosome that is deleted, affected individuals are less likely to develop hypertension. Therefore, the loss of this gene appears to be a protective factor. People with Williams syndrome whose NCF1 gene is not deleted have a higher risk of developing hypertension. The relationship between other genes in the deleted region of chromosome 7 and the signs and symptoms of Williams syndrome is unknown.",

        "Tyrosinemia is a genetic disorder characterized by disruptions in the multistep process that breaks down the amino acid tyrosine, a building block of most proteins. If untreated, tyrosine and its byproducts build up in tissues and organs, which can lead to serious health problems.  There are three types of tyrosinemia, which are each distinguished by their symptoms and genetic cause. Tyrosinemia type I, the most severe form of this disorder, is characterized by signs and symptoms that begin in the first few months of life. Affected infants fail to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive) due to poor food tolerance because high-protein foods lead to diarrhea and vomiting. Affected infants may also have yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), a cabbage-like odor, and an increased tendency to bleed (particularly nosebleeds). Tyrosinemia type I can lead to liver and kidney failure, softening and weakening of the bones (rickets), and an increased risk of liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma). Some affected children have repeated neurologic crises that consist of changes in mental state, reduced sensation in the arms and legs (peripheral neuropathy), abdominal pain, and respiratory failure. These crises can last from 1 to 7 days. Untreated, children with tyrosinemia type I often do not survive past the age of 10.  Tyrosinemia type II can affect the eyes, skin, and mental development. Signs and symptoms often begin in early childhood and include eye pain and redness, excessive tearing, abnormal sensitivity to light (photophobia), and thick, painful skin on the palms of their hands and soles of their feet (palmoplantar hyperkeratosis). About 50 percent of individuals with tyrosinemia type II have some degree of intellectual disability.  Tyrosinemia type III is the rarest of the three types. The characteristic features of this type include intellectual disability, seizures, and periodic loss of balance and coordination (intermittent ataxia).  About 10 percent of newborns have temporarily elevated levels of tyrosine (transient tyrosinemia). In these cases, the cause is not genetic. The most likely causes are vitamin C deficiency or immature liver enzymes due to premature birth.",

        "Isovolumetric relaxation is a phase of the cardiac cycle that occurs after the ejection phase and before the filling phase. It represents the period between the closing of the aortic valve and the opening of the mitral valve, during which the ventricles of the heart are briefly in a state of isovolumetric contraction, meaning that they are not changing in volume. During this phase, the pressure in the ventricles decreases as blood flows out into the aorta and pulmonary artery, but the volume of blood in the ventricles remains constant. Once the pressure in the ventricles drops below the pressure in the atria, the mitral valve opens and the filling phase begins.",

        "The pathophysiology of otosclerosis is complex. The key lesions of otosclerosis are multifocal areas of sclerosis within the endochondral temporal bone. These lesions share some characteristics with Paget\u2019s Disease, but they are not thought to be otherwise related. Histopathologic studies have all been done on cadaveric temporal bones, so only inferences can be made about progression of the disease histologically. This being said, it seems that the lesions go through an active \u201cspongiotic\u201d / hypervascular phase before developing into \u201csclerotic\u201d phase lesions. There have been many genes and proteins identified that, when mutated, may lead to these lesions. Also there is mounting evidence that measles virus is present within the otosclerotic foci, implicating an infectious etiology (this has also been noted in Paget\u2019s Disease).\nCHL in otosclerosis is caused by two main sites of involvement of the sclerotic (or scar-like) lesions. The best understood mechanism is fixation of the stapes footplate to the oval window of the cochlea. This greatly impairs movement of the stapes and therefore transmission of sound into the inner ear (\u201cossicular coupling\u201d). Additionally the cochlea\u2019s round window can also become sclerotic, and in a similar way impair movement of sound pressure waves through the inner ear (\u201cacoustic coupling\u201d).\nSNHL in otosclerosis is controversial. Over the past century, leading otologists and neurotologic researchers have argued whether the finding of SNHL late in the course of otosclerosis is due to otosclerosis or simply to typical presbycusis. There are certainly a few well documented instances of sclerotic lesions directly obliterating sensory structures within the cochlea and spiral ligament, which have been photographed and reported post-mortem. Other supporting data includes a consistent loss of cochlear hair cells in patients with otosclerosis; these cells being the chief sensory organs of sound reception. A suggested mechanism for this is the release of hydrolytic enzymes into the inner ear structures by the spongiotic lesions.\nThe disease can be considered to be heritable, but its penetrance and the degree of expression is so highly variable that it may be difficult to detect an inheritance pattern. Most of the implicated genes are transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion.",

        "Leukocyte extravasation occurs mainly in post-capillary venules, where haemodynamic shear forces are minimised. This process can be understood in several steps, outlined below as \"chemoattraction\", \"rolling adhesion\", \"tight adhesion\" and \"(endothelial) transmigration\". It has been demonstrated that leukocyte recruitment is halted whenever any of these steps is suppressed.\nUpon recognition of and activation by pathogens, resident macrophages in the affected tissue release cytokines such as IL-1, TNF\u03b1 and chemokines. IL-1 and TNF\u03b1 cause the endothelial cells of blood vessels near the site of infection to express cellular adhesion molecules, including selectins. Circulating leukocytes are localised towards the site of injury or infection due to the presence of chemokines.\nLike velcro, selectin ligands on circulating leukocytes bind selectins on the inner wall of the vessel, with marginal affinity. This causes the leukocytes to slow down and begin rolling along the inner surface of the vessel wall. During this rolling motion, transitory bonds are formed and broken between selectins and their ligands.\nAt the same time, chemokines released by macrophages activate the rolling leukocytes and cause surface integrin molecules to switch from the default low-affinity state to a high-affinity state. This is assisted through juxtacrine activation of integrins by chemokines and soluble factors released by endothelial cells. In the activated state, integrins bind tightly to complementary receptors expressed on endothelial cells, with high affinity. This effects the immobilisation of the leukocytes, despite the shear forces of the ongoing blood flow.\nThe cytoskeletons of the leukocytes are reorganised in such a way that the leukocytes are spread out over the endothelial cells. In this form, leukocytes extend pseudopodia and pass through gaps between endothelial cells. Transmigration of the leukocyte occurs as PECAM proteins, found on the leukocyte and endothelial cell surfaces, interact and effectively pull the cell through the endothelium. The leukocytes secrete proteases that degrade the basement membrane, allowing them to escape the blood vessel \u2013 a process known as diapedesis. Once in the interstitial fluid, leukocytes migrate along a chemotactic gradient towards the site of injury or infection.",

        "The genes involved in pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency each provide instructions for making a protein that is a component of a group of proteins called the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. This complex plays an important role in the pathways that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex converts a molecule called pyruvate, which is formed from the breakdown of carbohydrates, into another molecule called acetyl-CoA. This conversion is essential to begin the series of chemical reactions that produce energy for cells.  The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is made up of multiple copies of several enzymes called E1, E2, and E3, each of which performs part of the chemical reaction that converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. In addition, other proteins included in the complex ensure its proper function. One of these proteins, E3 binding protein, attaches E3 to the complex and provides the correct structure for the complex to perform its function. Other associated proteins control the activity of the complex: pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase turns on (activates) the complex, while pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase turns off (inhibits) the complex.  The E1 enzyme, also called pyruvate dehydrogenase, is composed of four parts (subunits): two alpha subunits (called E1 alpha) and two beta subunits (called E1 beta). Mutations in the gene that provides instructions for making E1 alpha, the PDHA1 gene, are the most common cause of pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, accounting for approximately 80 percent of cases. These mutations lead to a shortage of E1 alpha protein or result in an abnormal protein that cannot function properly. A decrease in functional E1 alpha leads to reduced activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.  Other components of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex are also involved in pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency. Mutations in the genes that provide instructions for E1 beta (the PDHB gene), the E2 enzyme (the DLAT gene), E3 binding protein (the PDHX gene), and pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (the PDP1 gene) have been identified in people with this condition. Although it is unclear how mutations in each of these genes affect the complex, reduced functioning of one component of the complex appears to impair the activity of the whole complex. As with PDHA1 gene mutations, changes in these other genes lead to a reduction of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity.  With decreased function of this complex, pyruvate builds up and is converted in another chemical reaction to lactic acid. The excess lactic acid causes lactic acidosis in affected individuals. In addition, the production of cellular energy is diminished. The brain, which requires especially large amounts of energy, is severely affected, resulting in the neurological problems associated with pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency.",

Some of the  lymph nodes under the arm may be removed and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.    Types of surgery to remove the cancer include:            -  Modified radical mastectomy: Surgery to remove the whole breast that has cancer, many of the lymph nodes under the arm, the lining over the chest muscles, and sometimes, part of the chest wall muscles. This type of surgery is most common in pregnant women.     -  Breast-conserving surgery: Surgery to remove the cancer and some normal tissue around it, but not the breast itself. Part of the chest wall lining may also be removed if the cancer is near it. This type of surgery may also be called lumpectomy, partial mastectomy, segmental mastectomy, quadrantectomy, or breast-sparing surgery.           Even if the doctor removes all of the cancer that can be seen at the time of surgery, the patient may be given radiation therapy or chemotherapy after surgery to try to kill any cancer cells that may be left. For pregnant women with early-stage breast cancer, radiation therapy and hormone therapy are given after the baby is born. Treatment given after surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    External radiation therapy is not given to pregnant women with early stage (stage I or II) breast cancer because it can harm the unborn baby. For women with late stage (stage III or IV) breast cancer, radiation therapy is not given during the first 3 months of pregnancy and is delayed until after the baby is born, if possible.       Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    Chemotherapy is usually not given during the first 3 months of pregnancy. Chemotherapy given after this time does not usually harm the unborn baby but may cause early labor and low birth weight.

Community-associated MRSA happens to people who have close skin-to-skin contact with others, such as athletes involved in football and wrestling.    Infection control is key to stopping MRSA in hospitals. To prevent community-associated MRSA       - Practice good hygiene    - Keep cuts and scrapes clean and covered with a bandage until healed    - Avoid contact with other people's wounds or bandages    - Avoid sharing personal items, such as towels, washcloths, razors, or clothes    - Wash soiled sheets, towels, and clothes in hot water with bleach and dry in a hot dryer       If a wound appears to be infected, see a health care provider. Treatments may include draining the infection and antibiotics.    NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases",
        "What are the signs and symptoms of Neurofibromatosis type 1? People affected by neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) have an increased risk of developing many different types of tumors (both cancerous and noncancerous). Almost all people with NF1 have neurofibromas, which are benign tumors that can affect nearly any nerve in the body. Most will develop these tumors on or just underneath the skin; however, neurofibromas can also grow in other places in the body and may even affect multiple nerves. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, which also grow along the nerves throughout the body, are the most common cancerous tumor found in people with NF1 and occur in approximately 10% of affected people. In children with NF1, the most common tumors are optic glioma (tumors that grow along the nerve leading from the eye to the brain) and brain tumors. Optic gliomas associated with NF1 are often asymptomatic although they can lead to vision loss. Other features of NF1 may include: Caf au lait spots (flat patches on the skin that are darker than the surrounding area) Freckling, especially in the underarm and groin Lisch nodules (clumps of pigment in the colored part of the eye that do not interfere with vision) Learning disabilities Seizures Autism spectrum disorder High blood pressure Short stature An unusually large head (macrocephaly) Skeletal abnormalities such as scoliosis GeneReview's Web site offers more specific information about the features of NF1.

People with this condition are genetically male, with one X and one Y chromosome in each cell, and they have male gonads (testes). Their bodies, however, do not produce enough of the male sex hormone testosterone. Testosterone has a critical role in male sexual development, and a shortage of this hormone disrupts the formation of the external sex organs before birth.  Most people with 17-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 deficiency are born with external genitalia that appear female. In some cases, the external genitalia do not look clearly male or clearly female (sometimes called ambiguous genitalia). Still other affected infants have genitalia that appear predominantly male, often with an unusually small penis (micropenis) or the urethra opening on the underside of the penis (hypospadias).  During puberty, people with this condition develop some secondary sex characteristics, such as increased muscle mass, deepening of the voice, and development of male pattern body hair. The penis and scrotum (the sac of skin that holds the testes) grow larger during this period. In addition to these changes typical of adolescent boys, some affected males may also experience breast enlargement (gynecomastia). Men with this disorder are generally unable to father children (infertile).  Children with 17-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 deficiency are often raised as girls. About half of these individuals adopt a male gender role in adolescence or early adulthood.",
        "What causes Swyer-James syndrome? The cause of Swyer-James syndrome is not completely understood. Most experts agree that the initial abnormality occurs in the distal bronchi (air tubes that bring air to and from the lungs) after an infection during early childhood. The smaller size of the affected lung may be due to the infection inhibiting the normal growth of the lung. A number of reports have described Swyer-James syndrome following childhood histories including radiation therapy; measles; pertussis (whooping cough); tuberculosis; breathing in a foreign body; mycoplasma; and viral infections, especially adenovirus. Research has suggested that a hyper-immune reaction in the lung (producing an unusual abundance of antibodies) may play a role in sustaining airway damage after the initial infection. Some have argued a pre-existing lung abnormality may predispose individuals to the condition. Although bronchial damage of some kind during childhood is generally considered to play an important role, many affected individuals have had no known history of an airway infection. It is possible that some unknown factors present at birth may contribute to the development of Swyer-James syndrome.",

        "Increases in hemoglobin F cause the O2-hemoglobin dissociation curve to shift to the left. This means that at any given partial pressure of oxygen, hemoglobin will bind more tightly to oxygen, making it less available for use by the body. Hemoglobin F is a type of hemoglobin that is found in fetal blood and has a higher affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin. This allows the fetus to extract oxygen from the mother's blood more efficiently. In adults, increased levels of hemoglobin F can occur in certain genetic disorders, such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia. Understanding the effects of hemoglobin F on the O2-hemoglobin dissociation curve is important for the diagnosis and management of these disorders.",
        "Morphine, heroin, and codeine are drugs that belong to the class of opioids. Specifically, they are classified as natural opioids, which means that they are derived from the opium poppy plant. These drugs work by binding to specific receptors in the brain and spinal cord, which can help to reduce pain and produce feelings of euphoria. While natural opioids can be effective pain relievers, they also carry a risk of addiction and overdose. In recent years, there has been a growing concern about the opioid epidemic, which has been fueled in part by the over-prescription of these drugs and the availability of illicit opioids like heroin.",
        "Adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy (AVMD) is an eye disorder that can cause progressive vision loss. AVMD affects an area of the retina called the macula, which is responsible for sharp central vision. The condition causes a fatty yellow pigment to accumulate in cells underlying the macula, eventually damaging the cells. Signs and symptoms usually begin between ages 30 and 50 and include blurred and/or distorted vision, which can progress to central vision loss over time.Historically, AVMD has been characterized as a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the PRPH2, BEST1, IMPG1, and IMPG2 genes; however, recent studies focused on genetic testing suggest that there may be other unidentified genes and/or environmental causes.The majority of cases due to a mutation in the identified genes are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner; however not all individuals have AVMD have a family history and not all individuals who inherit a causative gene mutation develop symptoms.",
        "Immune thrombocytopenia (THROM-bo-si-toe-PE-ne-ah), or ITP, is a bleeding disorder. In ITP, the blood doesn't clot as it should. This is due to a low number of blood cell fragments called platelets (PLATE-lets) or thrombocytes (THROM-bo-sites).\n                \nPlatelets are made in your bone marrow along with other kinds of blood cells. They stick together (clot) to seal small cuts or breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding.\n                \nOverview\n                \nWithout enough platelets, bleeding can occur inside the body (internal bleeding) or underneath or from the skin (external bleeding).\n                \nPeople who have ITP often have purple bruises called purpura (PURR-purr-ah). These bruises appear on the skin or mucous membranes (for example, in the mouth). Bleeding from small blood vessels under the skin causes purpura.\n                \nPeople who have ITP also may have bleeding that causes tiny red or purple dots on the skin. These pinpoint-sized dots are called petechiae (peh-TEE-kee-ay). Petechiae may look like a rash.\n                \nPetechiae and Purpura\n                \n\n                \nPeople who have ITP also may have nosebleeds, bleeding from the gums during dental work, or other bleeding that's hard to stop. Women who have ITP may have menstrual bleeding that's heavier than normal.\n                \nA lot of bleeding can cause hematomas (he-mah-TO-mas). A hematoma is a collection of clotted or partially clotted blood under the skin. It looks or feels like a lump.\n                \nBleeding in the brain as a result of ITP is very rare, but can be life threatening if it occurs.\n                \nIn most cases, an autoimmune response is thought to cause ITP. Normally, your immune system helps your body fight off infections and diseases. But if you have ITP, your immune system attacks and destroys its own platelets. The reason why this happens isn't known.\n                \nITP can't be passed from one person to another.\n                \nTypes of Immune Thrombocytopenia\n                \nThe two types of ITP are acute (temporary or short-term) and chronic (long-lasting).\n                \nAcute ITP generally lasts less than 6 months. It mainly occurs in childrenboth boys and girlsand is the most common type of ITP. Acute ITP often occurs after a viral infection.\n                \nChronic ITP lasts 6 months or longer and mostly affects adults. However, some teenagers and children do get this type of ITP. Chronic ITP affects women two to three times more often than men.\n                \nTreatment depends on the severity of bleeding and the platelet count. In mild cases, treatment may not be needed.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nFor most children and adults, ITP isn't a serious or life-threatening condition.\n                \nAcute ITP in children often goes away on its own within a few weeks or months and doesn't return. In 80 percent of children who have ITP, the platelet count returns to normal within 6 to 12 months. Treatment may not be needed.\n                \nFor a small number of children, ITP doesn't go away on its own and may require further medical or surgical treatment.\n                \nChronic ITP varies from person to person and can last for many years. Even people who have severe forms of chronic ITP can live for decades. Most people who have chronic ITP can stop treatment at some point and maintain a safe platelet count.",

        "The first line treatment for anorexia is usually focused on immediate weight gain, especially with those who have particularly serious conditions that require hospitalization. In particularly serious cases, this may be done as an involuntary hospital treatment under mental health law, where such legislation exists. In the majority of cases, however, people with anorexia are treated as outpatients, with input from physicians, psychiatrists, clinical psychologists and other mental health professionals.\nA recent clinical review has suggested that psychotherapy is an effective form of treatment and can lead to restoration of weight, return of menses among female patients, and improved psychological and social functioning when compared to simple support or education programmes.  However, this review also noted that there are only a small number of randomised controlled trials on which to base this recommendation, and no specific type of psychotherapy seems to show any overall advantage when compared to other types. Family therapy has also been found to be an effective treatment for adolescents with anorexia  and in particular, a method developed at the Maudsley Hospital is widely used and found to maintain improvement over time. \nIt is important to note that many recovering underweight people often harbour a hateful dislike for those who they feel to be robbing them of their treasured emaciation. Often when well-meaning friends or relatives compliment the recoveree on how much healthier they look, the recoveree's mind replaces \"healthy\" with \"fat\".\nDrug treatments, such as SSRI or other antidepressant medication, have not been found to be generally effective for either treating anorexia,  or preventing relapse  although it has also been noted that there is a lack of adequate research in this area. It is common, however, for antidepressants to be prescribed, often with the intent of trying to treat the associated anxiety and depression.\nSupplementation with 14mg/day of zinc is recommended as routine treatment for anorexia nervosa due to a study showing a doubling of weight regain after treatment with zinc was begun. The mechanism of action is hypothesized to be an increased effectiveness of neurotransmission in various parts of the brain, including the amygdala, after adequate zinc intake begins resulting in increased appetite. \nThere are various non-profit and community groups that offer support and advice to people who have anorexia, or are the carer of someone who does.

        "MTHFR gene mutation is a genetic change that disrupts the production of an enzyme that plays an important role in breaking down the amino acid homocysteine (a building block of protein). These mutations may cause a mild to severe loss of activity of this enzyme that can lead to elevated levels of homocysteine in the blood and/or urine. Some rare MTHFR gene mutations severely impair the function of this enzyme and lead to homocystinuria, an autosomal recessive condition characterized by various health problems including abnormal clotting and neurological problems (developmental delay, seizures, intellectual disability and microcephaly).

        "The lifelong diet can be difficult and socially troublesome, especially in young patients, but it is crucial in order to avoid serious health consequences. Teenagers in particular occasionally rebel against the dietary strictures and suffer relapses or complications as a result. The widespread use of wheat byproducts in prepared food, soups and sauces can make dining out problematic. This is especially true in the United States, where dermatitis herpetiformis disease is less widely-known among the wider population than it is in Europe. However, certain types of restaurants (e.g., Japanese, Thai, Indian, and Latin American) already offer a wide range of gluten-free menu options, and many major restaurant chains have responded to growing awareness of celiac disease (and by default dermatitis herpetiformis) by posting information about the gluten content of their menu items on their websites.\nIt is important for friends and family to understand that dermatitis herpetiformis is present for life.\nAs celiac disease has become better understood, the availability of gluten-free replacements for everyday treats such as muffins, bagels, pasta and the like has continually improved, as has their quality. This has also benefited those with dermatitis herpetiformis. People with dermatitis herpetiformis and/or celiac cannot eat only gluten-free foods but continue to consume one or two products that contain gluten. For example, drinking beer can still cause symptoms, but even this problem may now be overcome. There are many specialty brews around the world that may be described as gluten free beer.\nHowever, the case of beer raises the main problem of dermatitis herpetiformis and celiac disease: while the diet is strict and the effects of the disease are serious, the main symptom of the disease can be social isolation with those with dermatitis herpetiformis afraid to become involved in normal social life. Parties can be difficult, weddings and funerals hard, holidays awkward, a meal out a nightmare, travel is made more stressful, and even the trip to a bar or pub one that requires the individual to be constantly aware of the disease. It is too easy for the celiacs and those with dermatitis herpetiformis to withdraw from these normal activities, and many people with these complaints are working to create normal activities where they can forget the problem. It is important for newly diagnosed with either dermatitis herpetiformis or celiacs to ensure that they remain involved in their social life and explain their needs to family and friends.\nAlthough these diseases may tend to isolate individuals with the complaint, the situation is becoming less difficult year by year. Manufacturers are now making a wide range of very acceptable breads, and some pastas (notoriously horrible in the past) that are virtually indistinguishable from \"normal\" pasta. Restaurants are beginning to offer gluten free menus and are recognizing the size of the market that is largely not catered for. Celiacs and those with dermatitis herpetiformis should not be afraid to ask establishments how they can cater to them. Where the question has been asked repeatedly, the proprietors tend to recognize the need, and become aware of the revenue that is lost where they do not provide a full range of products.\nIn many ways beer seems to be the hardest gluten free product to \"get right\". However, gluten-free beer is now available and there is now a range of ales, beers, and lagers to choose from. Around the world standards of \"gluten free\" vary. For example, while in the United Kingdom a beer with less than 20 parts per million gluten (20ppm) is \"gluten free\", in Australia it is not possible to describe any product as such if any gluten can be detected at all. Similarly, some \"gluten free\" breads can contain low levels of gluten in one country, in another they would contravene labeling or food standards legislation.\nHowever, large scale commercial beers are out of the question for those who cannot consume gluten,    regardless of the sometimes misleading advice on some brewery websites. It is likely that most people with dermatitis herpetiformis celiacs will be able to drink beer at under 20ppm (in moderation) without causing themselves any harm. It is important, however, for consumers of all \"low gluten\" foods and beverages to tell their consultant, and to ensure that even if the obvious symptoms are absent, there are no other negative effects continuing that they are unaware of.\nHowever, the development of a range of gluten free beers is an example of those who cannot consume gluten \"working together to socialize normally and avoid isolation caused by their special dietary needs. It also represents part of the return to a \u2018normal\u2019 life.\"",

        "How Tumors Form The body is made up of many types of cells. Normally, cells grow, divide, and produce more cells as needed to keep the body healthy and functioning properly. Sometimes, however, the process goes wrong -- cells become abnormal and form more cells in an uncontrolled way. These extra cells form a mass of tissue, called a growth or tumor. Tumors can be benign, which means not cancerous, or malignant, which means cancerous. How Prostate Cancer Occurs Prostate cancer occurs when a tumor forms in the tissue of the prostate, a gland in the male reproductive system. In its early stage, prostate cancer needs the male hormone testosterone to grow and survive. The prostate is about the size of a large walnut. It is located below the bladder and in front of the rectum. The prostate's main function is to make fluid for semen, a white substance that carries sperm. Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer among American men. It is a slow-growing disease that mostly affects older men. In fact, more than 60 percent of all prostate cancers are found in men over the age of 65. The disease rarely occurs in men younger than 40 years of age. Prostate Cancer Can Spread Sometimes, cancer cells break away from a malignant tumor in the prostate and enter the bloodstream or the lymphatic system and travel to other organs in the body. When cancer spreads from its original location in the prostate to another part of the body such as the bone, it is called metastatic prostate cancer -- not bone cancer. Doctors sometimes call this distant disease. Surviving Prostate Cancer Today, more men are surviving prostate cancer than ever before. Treatment can be effective, especially when the cancer has not spread beyond the region of the prostate.",

        "Mutations in the TIMM8A gene cause DDON syndrome. The protein produced from this gene is found inside the energy-producing centers of cells (mitochondria). The TIMM8A protein forms a complex (a group of proteins that work together) with a very similar protein called TIMM13. This complex functions by transporting other proteins within the mitochondria.  Most mutations in the TIMM8A gene result in the absence of functional TIMM8A protein inside the mitochondria, which prevents the formation of the TIMM8A/TIMM13 complex.

        "Some women develop breast cancer and others do not, and the risk factors for the disease vary. Breast cancer may affect younger women, but three-fourths of all breast cancers occur in women between the ages of 45 to 85. In Situ and Invasive Breast Cancer Researchers often talk about breast cancer in two ways: in situ and invasive. In situ refers to cancer that has not spread beyond its site of origin. Invasive applies to cancer that has spread to the tissue around it. This chart shows what the approximate chances are of a woman getting invasive breast cancer in her lifetime. Risk Factors Risk factors are conditions or agents that increase a person's chances of getting a disease. Here are the most common risk factors for breast cancer. -   Older age. The risk of breast cancer in a 70 year old woman is about 10 times that of a 30 year old woman, but risk decreases after age 85.  Older age.

Other features may include feeding and respiratory problems, developmental delay, hearing impairment, awkward gait, stimulus-induced drop episodes, and heart and kidney involvement. The disorder affects males and females in equal numbers, but symptoms are usually more severe in males. The disorder is caused by a defective gene, RSK2, which is found in 1996 on the X chromosome (Xp22.2-p22.1).

This treatment can help your body better maintain the carbon dioxide and oxygen levels in your blood. PAP therapy also can help relieve daytime sleepiness.\n                \nYour doctor might recommend CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) or BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure). CPAP provides continuous mild air pressure to keep your airways open. BiPAP works almost the same, but it changes the air pressure while you breathe in and out.\n                \nThe machines have three main parts:\n                \nA mask or other device that fits over your nose or your nose and mouth.

The machines are small, lightweight, and fairly quiet. The noise they make is soft and rhythmic.\n                \nSome people who have OHS receive extra oxygen as part of their PAP treatment. However, oxygen therapy alone isn't recommended as a treatment for OHS.\n                \nPAP therapy also is used to treat obstructive sleep apnea. Many people who have OHS also have this common condition.\n                \nIf your doctor prescribes PAP therapy, you'll work with someone from a home equipment provider to select a CPAP or BiPAP machine.

One end of the tube is inserted into your windpipe, and the other end is hooked to the ventilator.\n                \nUsually, the breathing tube is put into your nose or mouth and then moved down into your throat. A tube placed like this is called an endotracheal (en-do-TRA-ke-al) tube. Endotracheal tubes are used only in a hospital setting.\n                \nSometimes the breathing tube is placed through a surgically made hole called a tracheostomy (TRA-ke-OS-toe-me). The hole goes through the front of your neck and into your windpipe.\n                \nThe procedure to make a tracheostomy usually is done in an operating room. You'll be given medicine so you won't feel any pain. The tracheostomy allows you to be on a ventilator in the hospital, in a long-term care facility, or at home.\n                \nTalk with your doctor about how long you'll need ventilator support and whether you can receive treatment at home.\n                \nFor more information about ventilator support, go to the Health Topics Ventilator/Ventilator Support article.\n                \nWeight Loss\n                \nYour doctor will likely recommend weight loss as part of your treatment plan. Successful weight loss often involves setting goals and making lifestyle changes. For example, eating fewer calories and being physically active can help you lose weight.\n                \nMedicines and weight-loss surgery might be an option if lifestyle changes aren't enough.

        "The euvolemic status in patients with SIADH is caused by volume expansion, which induces stretching of the right atrium (RA) and leads to high levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) release. ANP then acts on the kidneys to induce high water excretion and natriuresis.\n\nSIADH, or syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, is a condition in which the body produces too much antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to excessive water retention and a dilutional hyponatremia. Despite the excess water retention, patients with SIADH often present with a normal or euvolemic status.\n\nThe mechanism behind this euvolemic status is related to the effects of ANP, which is released in response to volume expansion. When the RA is stretched due to increased blood volume, it releases high levels of ANP, which acts on the kidneys to increase water excretion and natriuresis.\n\nIn patients with SIADH, the excess ADH production can lead to water retention and dilutional hyponatremia, but the normal or euvolemic status is maintained due to the counteracting effects of ANP.",

        "Transfusion medicine is a specialized branch of hematology that is concerned with the study of blood groups, along with the work of a blood bank to provide a transfusion service for blood and other blood products. Across the world, blood products must be prescribed by a medical doctor (licensed physician or surgeon) in a similar way as medicines. In the USA, blood products are tightly regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.\nMuch of the routine work of a blood bank involves testing blood from both donors and recipients to ensure that every individual recipient is given blood that is compatible and is as safe as possible. If a unit of incompatible blood is transfused between a donor and recipient, a severe acute immunological reaction, hemolysis (RBC destruction), renal failure and shock are likely to occur, and death is a possibility. Antibodies can be highly active and can attack RBCs and bind components of the complement system to cause massive hemolysis of the transfused blood.\nPatients should ideally receive their own blood or type-specific blood products to minimize the chance of a transfusion reaction. Risks can be further reduced by cross-matching blood, but this may be skipped when blood is required for an emergency. Cross-matching involves mixing a sample of the recipient's blood with a sample of the donor's blood and checking to see if the mixture agglutinates, or forms clumps. If agglutination is not obvious by direct vision, blood bank technicians usually check for agglutination with a microscope. If agglutination occurs, that particular donor's blood cannot be transfused to that particular recipient. In a blood bank it is vital that all blood specimens are correctly identified, so labeling has been standardized using a barcode system known as ISBT 128.\nThe blood group may be included on identification tags or on tattoos worn by military personnel, in case they should need an emergency blood transfusion. Frontline German Waffen-SS had such tattoos during World War II. Ironically, this was an easy form of SS identification. \nRare blood types can cause supply problems for blood banks and hospitals. For example Duffy -negative blood occurs much more frequently in people of African origin,  and the rarity of this blood type in the rest of the population can result in a shortage of Duffy-negative blood for patients of African ethnicity. Similarly for RhD negative people, there is a risk associated with travelling to parts of the world where supplies of RhD negative blood are rare, particularly East Asia, where blood services may endeavor to encourage Westerners to donate blood. \nA pregnant woman can make IgG blood group antibodies if her fetus has a blood group antigen that she does not have. This can happen if some of the fetus' blood cells pass into the mother's blood circulation (e.g. a small fetomaternal hemorrhage at the time of childbirth or obstetric intervention), or sometimes after a therapeutic blood transfusion. This can cause Rh disease or other forms of hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) in the current pregnancy and/or subsequent pregnancies. If a pregnant woman is known to have anti-RhD antibodies, the RhD blood type of a fetus can be tested by analysis of fetal DNA in maternal plasma to assess the risk to the fetus of Rh disease.  Antibodies associated with some blood groups can cause severe HDN, others can only cause mild HDN and others are not known to cause HDN.",

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.",

        "Key Points\n                    - There are different types of treatment for patients with hypopharyngeal cancer.     - Three types of standard treatment are used:         - Surgery      - Radiation therapy      - Chemotherapy         - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.    - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.    - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.    - Follow-up tests may be needed.\n                \n                \n                    There are different types of treatment for patients with hypopharyngeal cancer.\n                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with hypopharyngeal cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\n                \n                \n                    Three types of standard treatment are used:\n                    Surgery      Surgery (removing the cancer in an operation) is a common treatment for all stages of hypopharyngeal cancer. The following surgical procedures may be used:            - Laryngopharyngectomy: Surgery to remove the larynx (voice box) and part of the pharynx (throat).     - Partial laryngopharyngectomy: Surgery to remove part of the larynx and part of the pharynx. A partial laryngopharyngectomy prevents loss of the voice.      -  Neck dissection: Surgery to remove lymph nodes and other tissues in the neck.            Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.        Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.      -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat hypopharyngeal cancer.    Radiation therapy may work better in patients who have stopped smoking before beginning treatment. External radiation therapy to the thyroid or the pituitary gland may change the way the thyroid gland works. A blood test to check the thyroid hormone level in the body may be done before and after therapy to make sure the thyroid gland is working properly.        Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    Chemotherapy may be used to shrink the tumor before surgery or radiation therapy. This is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy.    See Drugs Approved for Head and Neck Cancer for more information. (Hypopharyngeal cancer is a type of head and neck cancer.)\n                \n                \n                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\n                    Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.\n                \n                \n                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\n                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\n                \n                \n                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\n                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.\n                \n                \n                    Follow-up tests may be needed.\n                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.   For hypopharyngeal cancer, follow-up to check for recurrence should include careful head and neck exams once a month in the first year after treatment ends, every 2 months in the second year, every 3 months in the third year, and every 6 months thereafter.\n                \n\t\t        \n\t\t            Treatment Options by Stage\n\t\t            \n\t\t                \n\t\t                    Stage I Hypopharyngeal Cancer\n\t\t                    Treatment of stage I hypopharyngeal cancer may include the following:          - Laryngopharyngectomy and neck dissection with or without high-dose radiation therapy to the lymph nodes of the neck.    - Partial laryngopharyngectomy with or without high-dose radiation therapy to the lymph nodes on both sides of the neck.

Risk factors include smoking, being overweight, and not getting enough exercise. Increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.\n                \n                \n                    The following are risk factors for lung cancer:\n                    Cigarette, cigar, and pipe smoking      Tobacco smoking is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Cigarette, cigar, and pipe smoking all increase the risk of lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women.    Studies have shown that smoking low tar or low nicotine cigarettes does not lower the risk of lung cancer.     Studies also show that the risk of lung cancer from smoking cigarettes increases with the number of cigarettes smoked per day and the number of years smoked. People who smoke have about 20 times the risk of lung cancer compared to those who do not smoke.       Secondhand smoke    Being exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke is also a risk factor for lung cancer. Secondhand smoke is the smoke that comes from a burning cigarette or other tobacco product, or that is exhaled by smokers. People who inhale secondhand smoke are exposed to the same cancer -causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts. Inhaling secondhand smoke is called involuntary or passive smoking.       Family history    Having a family history of lung cancer is a risk factor for lung cancer. People with a relative who has had lung cancer may be twice as likely to have lung cancer as people who do not have a relative who has had lung cancer. Because cigarette smoking tends to run in families and family members are exposed to secondhand smoke, it is hard to know whether the increased risk of lung cancer is from the family history of lung cancer or from being exposed to cigarette smoke.       HIV infection    Being infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is linked with a higher risk of lung cancer. People infected with HIV may have more than twice the risk of lung cancer than those who are not infected. Since smoking rates are higher in those infected with HIV than in those not infected, it is not clear whether the increased risk of lung cancer is from HIV infection or from being exposed to cigarette smoke.        Environmental risk factors            -   Radiation exposure: Being exposed to radiation is a risk factor for lung cancer. Atomic bomb radiation, radiation therapy, imaging tests, and radon are sources of radiation exposure:                   - Atomic bomb radiation: Being exposed to radiation after an atomic bomb explosion increases the risk of lung cancer.       - Radiation therapy: Radiation therapy to the chest may be used to treat certain cancers, including breast cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma. Radiation therapy uses x-rays, gamma rays, or other types of radiation that may increase the risk of lung cancer. The higher the dose of radiation received, the higher the risk. The risk of lung cancer following radiation therapy is higher in patients who smoke than in nonsmokers.       - Imaging tests: Imaging tests, such as CT scans, expose patients to radiation. Low-dose spiral CT scans expose patients to less radiation than higher dose CT scans. In lung cancer screening, the use of low-dose spiral CT scans can lessen the harmful effects of radiation.       - Radon: Radon is a radioactive gas that comes from the breakdown of uranium in rocks and soil. It seeps up through the ground, and leaks into the air or water supply. Radon can enter homes through cracks in floors, walls, or the foundation, and levels of radon can build up over time.             Studies show that high levels of radon gas inside the home or workplace increase the number of new cases of lung cancer and the number of deaths caused by lung cancer. The risk of lung cancer is higher in smokers exposed to radon than in nonsmokers who are exposed to it. In people who have never smoked, about 30% of deaths caused by lung cancer have been linked to being exposed to radon.     -  Workplace exposure: Studies show that being exposed to the following substances increases the risk of lung cancer:                  -  Asbestos.       -  Arsenic.       - Chromium.       - Nickel.       - Beryllium.       -  Cadmium.       - Tar and soot.            These substances can cause lung cancer in people who are exposed to them in the workplace and have never smoked. As the level of exposure to these substances increases, the risk of lung cancer also increases. The risk of lung cancer is even higher in people who are exposed and also smoke.      -  Air pollution: Studies show that living in areas with higher levels of air pollution increases the risk of lung cancer.              Beta carotene supplements in heavy smokers    Taking beta carotene supplements (pills) increases the risk of lung cancer, especially in smokers who smoke one or more packs a day. The risk is higher in smokers who have at least one alcoholic drink every day.\n                \n                \n                    The following are protective factors for lung cancer:\n                    Not smoking    The best way to prevent lung cancer is to not smoke.       Quitting smoking    Smokers can decrease their risk of lung cancer by quitting. In smokers who have been treated for lung cancer, quitting smoking lowers the risk of new lung cancers. Counseling, the use of nicotine replacement products, and antidepressant therapy have helped smokers quit for good.    In a person who has quit smoking, the chance of preventing lung cancer depends on how many years and how much the person smoked and the length of time since quitting. After a person has quit smoking for 10 years, the risk of lung cancer decreases 30% to 50%.    See the following for more information on quitting smoking:            -  Tobacco (includes help with quitting)     -  Cigarette Smoking: Health Risks and How to Quit               Lower exposure to workplace risk factors     Laws that protect workers from being exposed to cancer-causing substances, such as asbestos, arsenic, nickel, and chromium, may help lower their risk of developing lung cancer. Laws that prevent smoking in the workplace help lower the risk of lung cancer caused by secondhand smoke.       Lower exposure to radon     Lowering radon levels may lower the risk of lung cancer, especially among cigarette smokers. High levels of radon in homes may be reduced by taking steps to prevent radon leakage, such as sealing basements.\n                \n                \n                    It is not clear if the following decrease the risk of lung cancer:\n                    Diet     Some studies show that people who eat high amounts of fruits or vegetables have a lower risk of lung cancer than those who eat low amounts. However, since smokers tend to have less healthy diets than nonsmokers, it is hard to know whether the decreased risk is from having a healthy diet or from not smoking.       Physical activity    Some studies show that people who are physically active have a lower risk of lung cancer than people who are not. However, since smokers tend to have different levels of physical activity than nonsmokers, it is hard to know if physical activity affects the risk of lung cancer.\n                \n                \n                    The following do not decrease the risk of lung cancer:\n                    Beta carotene supplements in nonsmokers    Studies of nonsmokers show that taking beta carotene supplements does not lower their risk of lung cancer.       Vitamin E supplements      Studies show that taking vitamin E supplements does not affect the risk of lung cancer.\n                \n                \n                    Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.\n                    Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer.    The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting smoking, or taking certain medicines, vitamins, minerals, or food supplements.\n                \n                \n                    New ways to prevent lung cancer are being studied in clinical trials.\n                    Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials can be found in the Clinical Trials section of the NCI website. Check the list of NCI-supported cancer clinical trials for prevention trials for non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer that are now accepting patients. These include trials for quitting smoking.",

        "S3/S4 and JVD are the clinical signs that are commonly used to distinguish CHF from ARDS. S3/S4 refers to the third and fourth heart sounds, which are indicative of impaired ventricular filling and are typically present in patients with CHF. JVD, or jugular venous distension, is the visible bulging of the jugular veins in the neck, which is also a common sign of CHF. In contrast, ARDS is characterized by severe respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray. While both CHF and ARDS can present with similar symptoms, such as shortness of breath and pulmonary edema, the presence of S3/S4 and JVD is more specific to CHF and can help clinicians differentiate between the two conditions.",

        "The recommended management approach for an unstable patient with bradycardia is to administer atropine. Bradycardia is a condition in which the heart beats too slowly, which can lead to reduced blood flow to vital organs. In some cases, bradycardia can cause symptoms such as dizziness, shortness of breath, and chest pain, and can even progress to cardiac arrest. When a patient with bradycardia is unstable, immediate intervention is necessary to increase the heart rate and improve blood flow. Atropine is a medication that can be used to increase the heart rate by blocking the action of the vagus nerve, which slows down the heart. It is usually given intravenously and can take effect within minutes. In some cases, other interventions such as pacing or the use of an external defibrillator may be necessary. The specific management approach will depend on the underlying cause of the bradycardia and the patient's overall clinical condition.",

        "Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is one of a group of genetic disorders called the leukodystrophies, which are characterized by the toxic buildup of lipids (fatty materials such as oils and waxes) and other storage materials in cells in the white matter of the central nervous system and peripheral nerves. The buildup of storage materials impairs the growth or development of the myelin sheath, the fatty covering that acts as an insulator around nerve fibers. (Myelin, which lends its color to the white matter of the brain, is a complex substance made up of a mixture of fats and proteins.) MLD is one of several lipid storage diseases, which result in the harmful buildup of lipids in brain cells and other cells and tissues in the body. People with lipid storage diseases either do not produce enough of one of the enzymes needed to break down (metabolize) lipids or they produce enzymes that do not work properly. Some leukodystrophies are caused by genetic defects of enzymes that regulate the metabolism of fats needed in myelin synthesis. MLD, which affects males and females, is cause by a deficiency of the enzyme arylsulfatase A. MLD has three characteristic forms: late infantile, juvenile, and adult. Late infantile MLD typically begins between 12 and 20 months following birth. Infants appear normal at first but develop difficulty walking after the first year of life and eventually lose the ability to walk. Other symptoms include muscle wasting and weakness,developmental delays, progressive loss of vision leading to blindness, impaired swallowing, and dementia before age 2. Most children with this form of MLD die by age 5. Symptoms of the juvenile form of MLD (which begins between 3-10 years of age) include impaired school performance, mental deterioration, an inability to control movements, seizures, and dementia. Symptoms continue to get worse, and death eventually occurs 10 to 20 years following disease onset.. The adult form commonly begins after age 16, with symptoms that include psychiatric disturbances, seizures, tremor, impaired concentration, depression, and dementia. Death generally occurs within 6 to 14 years after onset of symptoms.",
        "Researchers have found that many factors cause growth failure in children with CKD. In addition to removing wastes and extra fluid from the blood, the kidneys perform important functions for a childs growth. Understanding normal kidney function and growth helps families understand what causes growth failure in children with CKD.\n                \nNormal kidney function helps maintain the\n                \n- balance of nutrients and minerals, such as calcium and phosphorus, in the blood. These minerals are essential for normal bone growth. The kidneys use a hormone called calcitriol, a form of vitamin D, to help bones absorb the right amount of calcium from the blood. The kidneys also remove extra phosphorus, helping balance phosphorus and calcium levels in the blood.  - bodys ability to use growth hormone. Growth hormone is necessary during childhood to help bones grow and stay healthy. The pituitary gland naturally produces growth hormone, which acts as a messenger to help the body grow. Growth hormone tells the liver to produce another hormone, called insulin-like growth factor, that travels to muscles, organs, and bones and tells them to grow.  - correct levels of erythropoietin in the body. Erythropoietin is a hormone that helps bone marrow make red blood cells.  - proper balance of sodium, also called salt; potassium; and acid-base levels in the blood. Acid-base balance refers to the amount of acid in the blood.\n                \nDamaged kidneys can slow a childs growth by\n                \n- causing mineral and bone disorder, which occurs when      - vitamin D is not turned into calcitriol, which starves the bones of calcium.    - phosphorus levels rise in the blood and draw calcium out of the bones and into the blood, causing the bones to weaken.    - creating an imbalance of sodium, potassium, and acid-base levels in the blood, also called acidosis. When blood is not balanced, the body slows growth to focus energy on restoring the balance.  - decreasing appetite. A child with CKD may not be hungry, or he or she may not have the energy to eat, which may lead to poor nutrition and slower growth.  - decreasing the production of erythropoietin. When erythropoietin levels are low, a child may develop anemiaa condition that develops when the blood does not have enough healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen to cells throughout the body. Anemia can cause growth to slow or stop.  - making an abnormally large amount of urine, called polyuria, which disrupts the bodys fluid balance. A child with polyuria loses minerals as well. The body slows growth to make up for the lost fluid and minerals.  - preventing the body from correctly using growth hormone. When the kidneys are damaged, waste builds up in the blood and the body does not properly process growth hormone.",
